Key takeaways China\u2019s long-term strategic interests are driving its ambition to be carbon neutral by 2060, but its push towards decarbonisation will be balanced with economic stability and energy security Nationwide coordination is key to China\u2019s decarbonisation and is creating investment opportunities across different sectors beyond the \u2018traditional\u2019 areas of renewable energy and electric vehicles There remains significant room for improvement among corporates, especially when it comes to setting quantitative decarbonisation carbon targets and roadmaps When China\u2019s President Xi Jinping announced an ambitious set of decarbonisation goals to the UN General Assembly in 2020, some wondered what the real motives could be. China would aim for peak CO2 emissions by 2030, he stated, and for carbon neutrality by 2060. Today, the answer is becoming increasingly clear; with approximately one fifth of the world\u2019s population and a vast land mass, it is natural that China would take a long-term strategic interest in limiting climate change and its destabilising effects. But China\u2019s decarbonisation targets go beyond the country becoming more responsible as a global citizen; carbon neutrality also serves China\u2019s long-term strategic interests on other fronts. For instance, leading in the race for net zero could bolster technological leadership, while home-grown renewable energy should secure energy supplies in a country that relies heavily on imported crude oil and natural gas. It is important to note, however, that China\u2019s path towards net zero will not be linear. Progress towards the end goal needs to be balanced by economic stability and energy security, and the journey will not be smooth. Three levers of progress The task facing China is huge. The country is currently responsible for around a third of the world\u2019s CO2 emissions \u2013 more than the US, Europe and Japan combined. Further, with gross domestic product (GDP) per capita still lagging mature economies, emissions are a long way from naturally peaking. And, as Exhibit 1 shows, the country still relies on coal \u2013 the most polluting fuel \u2013 for half of its energy: Even so, China seems committed to achieving net zero and will pursue it using a number of different \u201clevers\u201d. The three key levers which each bring possible investment opportunities are: Exhibit 1: primary energy consumption breakdown (2020) Source: BP energy statistics. Data as at 31 December 2020 Energy efficiency improvement through enhanced technologies, improving the power generation mix and transforming the national power supply system, and the long-term decarbonisation of heavy manufacturers. According to Tsinghua University, one of China\u2019s leading climate change faculties, energy efficiency improvements will likely have the most immediate part to play in decarbonisation. Temperature-proof building materials, automated production processes, smart route planning and industrial recycling are some examples of the ways China could achieve these efficiency improvements. The electrification of transportation is another key factor. China accounted for around half of global sales of electric vehicles (EVs) during 2021 and it hosts six of the top 10 battery manufacturers globally (see Exhibit 2). The country is also electrifying buses and railways. Semiconductors and the software powering advanced driving systems are just two of the opportunities that electrification could provide for investors. Related content Mid-year outlook: China\u2019s path out of its perfect storm Discover more Outside of energy efficiency, improving the energy mix will be essential. The International Energy Agency estimates that by 2060, around 74% of China\u2019s primary energy consumption should come from wind, solar, hydro or other renewables.1 Advances in this area have already been swift: in 2021 China represented about a third of wind and solar installation globally. This means China\u2019s domestic market has a mature supply chain. It is already competitive internationally and is exporting wind turbines to southeast Asian and European markets. Within China, though, there is a natural mismatch between renewable energy generation and consumption. Wind and solar power are generated mainly in the north and west of the country, but chiefly used in the eastern coastal cities. Also, the peak time for solar generation is around lunch, while peak usage is in the evening. In order to overcome this imbalance and match generation with usage, China will need ultra-high-voltage power transmission, an intelligent national power grid system, an abundant energy storage system and a well-designed market mechanism to allocate energy in the most efficient way, all of which should create further investment opportunities. The third lever is likely to also be the most difficult \u2013 decarbonising heavy manufacturing. Technological breakthroughs in areas such as carbon capture and hydrogen steel will be key to reducing emissions in the most polluting areas, such as steel, cement and aluminium, which underpin the economically critical property and infrastructure sectors. China\u2019s state-owned enterprises are leading the way in this area but, in reality, we are unlikely to see practical benefits in terms of meaningfully lower carbon emissions in the near term. Exhibit 2: global EV battery installation in 2021 (GWh) Source: SneResearch, as at December 31 2021 Room for improvement in corporate targets China\u2019s path towards carbon neutrality by 2060 has been charted and progress is being made. Even so, despite the government\u2019s commitment, individual companies have been slower than those elsewhere to formalise climate policies and set quantitative carbon reduction targets. There is a perceived lack of the specialist skills, tools and science-based framework required but it should be remembered that China is only two years into this journey, and that many companies are still ramping up for the long-term change required. We expect companies in China to follow the government\u2019s lead. Corporate frameworks should follow soon, and with them the transparency that investors increasingly seek. Such change will give further evidence of China\u2019s accelerating drive for decarbonisation \u2013 and the investment opportunities it is yielding.

        "content": " Supply chain shake-up sparks innovation revolution Virginie Maisonneuve 8/16/2022 Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on Twitter Share via email New technologies are helping companies reinvent disrupted supply chains and build more resilience into the system. Key-takeaways Supply chains are still reeling from the impact of Covid-19, war in Ukraine and deglobalisation in some sectors Upheaval to trade may impact corporate earnings, but companies are mitigating risks by shaking up their supply chains and investing in technology Amid the disruption, investors can find opportunities in sectors such as robotics, data centres, and agricultural technology that underpin the supply chain revolution While the recent resumption of grain shipments from the port of Odesa offers some relief to the myriad countries reliant on Ukraine for food staples, the supply chain stresses that have beset the global economy since 2020 are lingering. Shortages of goods from toilet paper to semiconductor chips have been a headache for consumers and businesses alike around the world over the past two years or so, due to factors ranging from Covid-19 to deglobalisation in certain sectors and, most recently, the war in Ukraine. Related content Insights Unpacking opportunities from supply chain innovation Discover more While there are some signs of supply chain pressures easing most recently, stresses remain at historically high levels and the risk of escalating geopolitical tensions, labour strikes and further Covid-19 lockdowns in China loom on the horizon.1 But this period of disruption has a silver lining. In many instances, it is accelerating innovation as businesses seek to future-proof their operations, often by investing in technology or overhauling decades-old supply chain strategies. For investors, the shake-up represents both challenges and opportunities for their portfolios. In the shorter-term, the supply chain dislocation is likely to squeeze corporate profit margins, particularly for those companies most vulnerable to higher costs caused by supply delays. These companies include transport and logistics firms, manufacturers and retailers. In the longer-term, however, investors can position for opportunities in areas from robotics to supplier diversification as businesses seek to build more resilience into their operations. Investing in innovation So, how are companies innovating in the face of today\u2019s disruption? From managing greater inventory build-up to helping pack shipments more efficiently, companies are exploring how to optimise supply chains through automation and smart use of data. This includes greater use of robots. With many firms grappling with higher expenses from surging inflation, robots can also help companies streamline routine tasks such as inventory and fulfilment, while managing labour costs, focusing on staffing in higher-value areas where automation isn\u2019t viable. And there\u2019s potential for more investment. Currently, there are 126 industrial robots per 10,000 manufacturing jobs globally, implying a robot density of about 1%, according to the latest figures from International Federation of Robotics. High single-digit robot density in manufacturing hubs like South Korea and Singapore shows the potential for catch-up in markets such as China, the US and France, where density is much lower (see Exhibit 1).2 Exhibit 1: Robot density in the manufacturing industry Note: Robot density nearly doubled globally \u2013 International Federation of Robotics (ifr.org).Source: World Robotics 2021. Focus on food Another area of innovation is agricultural technology. Food security fears intensified by the Ukraine war and Covid-19 have ignited further interest in agricultural technology. Food prices reached record highs in the early part of 2022 and although they\u2019ve since eased, high fertiliser prices, a bleak economic outlook and currency movements could threaten the outlook. We think this will open the way for more investment in agricultural technology and water irrigation equipment. The sector\u2019s long-term growth outlook has strengthened in recent years as more countries seek to build resilience into food supply chains to reduce the impact of increasingly regular natural events such as drought and floods brought on by climate change. Investment in farm tech venture capital, spanning everything from the use of robots to GPS technology, surged to a record USD 11.3 billion in 2021, up 61% from the previous year.3 Spending is likely to ramp up further as modern farm technology brings down usage of water, fertiliser and pesticides. Gathering the data Other technology in the form of advanced analytics can help companies plan and navigate risks. One of the challenges highlighted by the recent supply chain instability was that very few firms had an overview of their supply chains at every stage. According to a 2021 McKinsey survey, companies that successfully managed the Covid-19 pandemic were 2.5 times more likely to report they had pre-existing advanced-analytics capabilities.4 Firms investing in advanced analytics might be better placed to ride out supply chain dislocations and economic headwinds. The thirst by companies for more sophisticated information is also sparking greater interest in data centres. For investors, data centres offer diversification and exposure to assets with long-term growth drivers. Supply chain shifts But aside from appreciating the technological revolution, investors also need to be attuned to broader strategic changes businesses are making to their supply chain management \u2013 and seek out those companies taking a proactive approach to the recent challenges. A significant hurdle thrown up by the recent disruption has been limitations in companies\u2019 ability to respond in an agile way to changes in consumer demand or geopolitical events, such as US-China trade tensions, Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, or the war in Ukraine. In response, some car manufacturers and other firms are ripping up just-in-time models that have formed the backbone of supply chain management for decades in favour of just-in-case, which requires holding greater inventory. Related content Insights Supply chain snapshot: uncovering opportunities despite disruption Discover more Other firms are diversifying suppliers in the form of nearshoring \u2013 the process of transferring manufacturing or supplier business closer to the location of customer demand. Nearshoring trends may help support interest in local warehouses as more firms seek to build greater supply chain resilience to help guard against bottlenecks caused by either geopolitical flare-ups or a repeat of the shortages that plagued supplies during the Covid-19 pandemic. In some cases, governments are seeking to reduce their countries\u2019 reliance on key components sourced from overseas. In August 2022, the United States passed a law to provide billions of dollars of subsidies for domestic semiconductor production and research. The European Union and others have announced similar plans to develop their own chipmaking industries. Eventually, that may help ease a global chip shortage stoked by surging demand for cars and other products that include chips. Those companies that manage supply chain challenges now could be better positioned to ride out \u2013 and even thrive \u2013 during periods of future disruption. In summary, investors should think strategically about what supply chain issues mean for their portfolio \u2013 both the impact on assets from short-term disruption and the longer-term opportunities that may arise from broader structural shifts in manufacturing and logistic markets and the technologies that support them.

        "content": " The benefits of multi asset strategies in an inflationary environment Gregor Hirt | Nicolas Hengstebeck 8/8/2022 Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on Twitter Share via email Investors are witnessing unprecedented market conditions. Within a turbulent market environment characterised by a high inflationary pressure, a shift from global to \u201cglocal\u201d trade patterns and a fading era of cheap energy, how can an active and agile multi asset approach be best placed to deliver returns? Key takeaways Fundamental shifts in monetary, energy and trade policy are driving the markets With both equities and fixed income having a very rough ride so far, many investors and market participants cannot help feeling that there is currently nowhere to hide An active and agile multi asset approach can help investors to exploit pockets of significant outperformance even under this unprecedented market circumstances. We are currently experiencing a unique market environment, with few parallels in financial history. Not only have recent months seen a tectonic shift in both geopolitics and the economics and politics of energy supply, but we are also undergoing a huge and brutal reversal in the massive monetary support initiated in the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis and more recently accelerated due to Covid. Here, we take a look at current and possible future market environments, as well as discuss how an active multi asset strategy is best placed to deliver returns under these conditions. The market view \u2013 nowhere to hide? Turbulent market environments can often lead to situations where one asset class or another performs very well, on a risk adjusted basis. For instance, around the time of the end of the tech bubble in 2000 and 2001, equities, of course, performed poorly, yet bonds did very well, showing elevated Sharpe ratios throughout this period. However, in 2022, we are so far seeing both equities and fixed income having a very rough ride. While the performance of equities has been more expected, the trajectory of the bond market has taken some by surprise \u2013 indeed, the \u201ctraditional\u201d 60/40 equity/bond split preferred by many US investors, and the 30/70 portfolio favoured by Europeans, have exhibited disastrous returns this period and even a risk parity portfolio has struggled. Given this unusual correlation between equities and fixed income, many investors and market participants must be feeling that there is currently nowhere to hide. Exhibit 1: Historical calendar year Sharpe Ratios Source: AllianzGI Pockets of significant outperformance But is this really the case? If we dig a little deeper, we see that, even under such unprecedented conditions, there remain pockets of significant outperformance. Indeed, commodities and energy stocks, for instance, show that there are still good ways of diversifying portfolios, despite the overall performance of equities and fixed income. These pockets of outperformance point to the benefits available from adopting a flexible multi asset strategy; by combining asset classes with different risk profiles \u2013 assets that react differently depending on economic developments and the trajectory of key financial indicators \u2013 one can profit from diversification effects and achieve an elevated risk-adjusted return. Before taking a closer look at some practical examples of a multi asset approach, it\u2019s worth returning to the current market environment and, more specifically, the question of whether the existing high level of correlation between equities and bonds will endure for an extended period, or is it an anomaly that will soon come to an end? Our message here is a mixed one. The monetary policy reversal we are experiencing is a genuine shock. What started during the financial crisis, and even increased during Covid, is now being rapidly adjusted in an effort to check rising and potentially out of control inflation. So, liquidity is being taken out of the system and there is less cheap money to borrow. This not only affects the bond market, but also equities as it become more expensive for corporates to borrow for investment and future growth. The effects of this shock could endure for some time. Alongside these changes, we are possibly also experiencing a regime shift. After decades of increasing global trade, things are changing. We\u2019re now heading towards what some call glocalisation \u2013 supply chains are shortening, and production is moving to more regional setups. Indeed, this is something that began before the armed conflict in Ukraine, with the trade issues between the US and China, but has begun to accelerate in 2022. Capital and labour are becoming less efficiently allocated, and growth potential is reduced. And if the result is corporates having less ability to access cheap labour, then prices will increase. These trends may be somewhat offset by productive increases thanks to, for instance, robotisation, but the overall effect is still a net negative and likely inflationary. At the same time, the Russian invasion has drawn attention to underinvestment in energy producing capabilities \u2013 a situation catalysed by the war in Ukraine, but that has been apparent for some time. And we also have a policy direction that involves rapidly increasing the use of green energy. Combined, these trends mean that the era of cheap energy that we\u2019ve enjoyed for several decades could be challenged, for now at least. Exhibit 2: Relative return patterns in the first six months of 2022 by asset class or factor Source: Bloomberg, AllianzGI Opportunities for effective diversification Glocalisation and more expensive energy mean higher inflation. While inflation is clearly a concern for market participants of all types, it has a particular significance for multi asset investors as it is highly determinant of how individual asset classes will perform. For instance, we can see that, if we expect high inflation, then investing in commodities is likely to be a favoured option for many. However, what is just as important as the actual rate of inflation is its expected trajectory. For instance, we can also see that, when inflation is high but set to fall, then commodities are no longer where investors want to be. This is key in terms of sequencing \u2013 knowing when to move from one asset class, in this case commodities, to another, perhaps bonds. How does this affect a multi asset approach in practice? It means that, whatever the market conditions, there are always opportunities to effectively diversify \u2013 even pockets of opportunities within asset classes that, overall, might not be performing well. Indeed, we are convinced that an agile multi asset strategy is currently the right approach. Exhibit 3: Average annual real asset returns since 1971 in times of positive inflation surprises and inflation >2% Sources: Allianz GI, Global Financial Data, Refinitiv, data as at 4/2021.

Legend: yoy change in annual inflation <0%; numbers show arithmeticaverage returns for periods in respective inflation buckets and increases in yoy-inflation rates The benefits of an active multi asset approach The below chart shows a sample multi asset portfolio as a representative example of how a multi asset approach can work during the types of market conditions we are currently experiencing. Here, we see that, since January 2020, there have been significant shifts in the portfolio\u2019s allocations. In times of market correction and a high correlation between equities and fixed income, the cash position can be rapidly increased \u2013 as happened in April 2020, due to the onset of the pandemic, and in early 2022 when it became apparent that fixed income and equities might underperform \u2013 and be ready to rerisk when the time is right. The chart also shows how the fixed income position shrank considerably in late 2021 and early 2022 in anticipation of the shift in central bank policy. A change such as this is relatively straightforward to foresee, so the portfolio adopted a defensive position. But what about the opportunities? Commodities performed well in H2 2021 and H1 2022 up to May, so there are relatively high allocations to commodities during this period. In this respect, having the freedom to move quickly and harvest opportunities for clients is key. In addition to commodities, there have been more satellite themes and specific pockets of growth that a sample portfolio could have utilised during the first half of 2022, such as selected equity markets in Latin America, cross-asset trend following strategies similar to \u201cCTAs\u201d and, towards the middle of the year, selected equity markets in Asia, which offered good potential to generate absolute performance contributions for multi asset portfolios. Indeed, compared to a less dynamic and constrained strategic asset allocation, an actively managed multi asset approach, can increase return potential over a market cycle and provide significant mitigation of downside risk, even though losses remain possible and a success cannot be guaranteed. It should also be noted that active multi asset strategies approaches incur higher fees than passive approaches, and that multi asset strategies in general have a lower return potential than equity strategies. What is key for active multi asset strategies is being agile \u2013 reading the market and being prepared and able to make the necessary moves at short notice.

        "content": " Navigating uncertainty through trade finance David Newman | Raphael Haselberger 7/29/2022 Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on Twitter Share via email Supply chain strains, geopolitical tensions and a scaling back of bank funding are spurring demand for trade finance. Institutional investors can benefit from the potential for attractive returns and the short duration of the asset class. Key takeaways: Trade finance provides a bridge between the delivery of products and payment Covid-19, geopolitics and supply chain issues have all fuelled recent trade disruption \u2013 and trade finance can help to fund the movement of goods For investors, the short-term maturity profile, low correlation to other asset classes and potentially attractive returns can help in navigating uncertain markets Trade finance needs are rising, driven by recent supply chain disruptions and a tightening of bank funding. The scale of disruption caused to global trade over the past two years \u2013 including the impact of Covid-19 and geopolitical tensions \u2013 means there\u2019s significant demand for this financing mechanism, which bridges the gap between the delivery of products and payment. According to the most recent estimate by the Asian Development Bank, the global trade finance gap widened to USD 1.7 trillion in 2020. Small and medium-sized businesses are most in need of help as some banks, the traditional key suppliers of trade finance, scaled back availability of funding in the aftermath of the pandemic. The impact of trade disruption can fall disproportionately on the world\u2019s poorest people, given the vital role trade plays in reducing poverty by creating jobs and stimulating economic growth. Institutional investors in search of diversified assets can help by investing in trade finance. In return, they can gain access to the complexity premium that the asset class offers. How does trade finance work? Trade finance is similar to a line of credit from a third-party financier that helps companies fund the buying and selling of goods. For example, it enables suppliers to receive money straight away, despite their buyers not needing to pay until sometime in the future. Trade finance can be divided into four main categories: 1 / Payable finance \u2013 supports a buyer by facilitating payments to its suppliers when invoices are raised. 2 / Receivable finance \u2013 provides money to a single supplier in advance of its receiving invoice payments from several customers. 3 / Working capital facilities \u2013 provide loans to one supplier repaid by receivables from several customers. 4 / Documentary credits \u2013 common instruments used by companies to finance specific trade flows and payments under commercial contracts, including letters of credit, bills of exchange and trade loans. Why is trade finance a potentially attractive option for institutional investors? In an environment of heightened geopolitical tensions, volatile bond yields and rising inflation, trade finance can offer the flexibility and potential returns to help investors navigate the uncertain global outlook. Its short-term maturity profile \u2013 typically, transactions have a life cycle of between 60 and 120 days \u2013 and potentially low correlation to other asset classes can help investors manage a rising interest rate environment. Investments in trade finance can help investors manage downside risks as it tends to exhibit low volatility, as was the case during the most recent turbulence roiling public markets. The asset class can also help investors meet long-term sustainability goals. Since international trade is an engine for inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction, trade finance can be an important tool in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. At the same time, structural changes are paving the way for institutional investors to enter the market. Banks are looking for partners to fulfil their clients\u2019 needs as they struggle to keep up with growing demand due to regulatory capital requirements. Meanwhile, financial technology companies have brought innovation to the field, reducing unit costs and making small financing volumes economical. What are the risks of the asset class? The primary risks in trade finance are credit and fraud risk. Credit analysis and diversification mitigates credit risk. Fraud risk can be managed by analysis of the relationship between buyers and suppliers and other parties involved. Careful selection of sourcing partners and due diligence, combined with diversification, should reduce risks. The use of historical data when evaluating the supplier and buyer to determine pricing can lead to the risk of delays and dilution, where the amount that may be payable by the debtor on an agreement will be less than the invoiced amount. But, again, due diligence can help mitigate risk levels. How can trade finance fit within a portfolio? As investors look beyond the main asset classes to diversify return streams in a low-yield environment, trade finance can offer an attractive diversification option: The asset class can act as an alternative to traditional credit assets such as asset-backed securities (ABS) and short-dated investment-grade bonds due to a potentially increased yield helped by a complexity premium. Equally, trade finance may replace government bonds holdings as it offers the possibility of stable returns and low sensitivity to rate changes. Finally, trade finance can also act as a strategic cash position. Its semi-liquid structure gives investors the ability to shift or re-allocate portfolios. That ensures trade finance can provide a potential funding source for private market capital calls. While this is a relatively new and complex asset class, with the right partner it is possible to take advantage of the potential benefits trade finance offers. DOWNLOAD THE PDF "

        "content": " Mineral commodities primer: Copper 7/27/2022 Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on Twitter Share via email Copper is one of the most widely extracted metals, with only iron and aluminium being produced in greater quantities. The attractiveness of copper lies largely in its excellent conductive properties, both thermal and electrical, as well as its antimicrobial properties. Key takeaways: Global trends point to strong growth in copper demand over the coming years. Copper indispensable for the decarbonization of energy production and transport. Long project lead times and ESG scrutiny will dampen supply growth. Prices likely to be well supported for the foreseeable future. Indeed, copper has a broad range of uses that include electronics, plumbing, jewellery and coin production, as well as medical applications. And it is for these reasons, in particular, that we see the usage of copper growing in many areas of economic and daily life \u2013 energy infrastructure, transport, and consumer electronics are just three key growth areas where copper is indispensable and often irreplaceable. Combined with the lack of viable substitutes for many applications, several global megatrends mean that copper demand is likely to continue growing steadily for many years to come. Critical here are ongoing efforts to decarbonize energy production, as well as passenger and freight transport. For example, wind and solar energy production requires around 2.5 times the copper per megawatt (MW) output than thermal generation,1 while the average battery electric vehicle (EV) uses around four times as much copper as an equivalent vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine.2 Industry overview Copper extraction typically takes place in large scale mines using industrial techniques, meaning that new projects can have long lead-in times, require considerable capex commitments, and often raise complex ESG issues involving both effects on the natural environment and on local communities in the areas where extraction takes place. Mining is generally conducted using open pits; while the number of underground operations is growing, the economics of extraction dictate that these require higher ore grades \u2013 or the existence of valuable by-products \u2013 to be viable. Geographically, copper production is currently concentrated in Chile (5.6 million metric tons in 2021, representing 27% of global production), Peru (2.2m tons; 10%), China (1.8m tons; 9%), DR Congo (1.8m tons; 9%), and the USA (1.2m tons; 6%).3 In corporate terms, the copper extraction industry is consolidated with several major players controlling a significant share of the market. For instance, the top five players in 2020 produced 6.28 million metric tons between them, or around 30% of total global production.4 In terms of copper smelting \u2013 the metallurgical process used to produce copper metal from unprocessed ores or copper scrap \u2013 China is dominant, with at least six of the world\u2019s largest 20 smelters and over 50% of world copper smelter production in 2020;5 a reflection of China\u2019s huge and growing demand for the metal, currently totalling over 50% of total global consumption.6 As with the extraction of copper ore itself, the smelting and refining process must also reckon with its own environmental footprint, with key issues including the management of off-gases and dust, as well as the energy-intensive nature of the smelting process. Percentage share of global production Source: U.S. Geological Survey, Mineral Commodity Summaries,January 2022 Supply, demand, and price outlook Decarbonization represents one of the most profound trends currently affecting economies throughout the world. With the switch to sustainable energy production and away from the internal combustion engine both crucial elements of achieving the Paris climate goals, copper\u2019s growing role cannot be understated. To put it simply, there can be \u201cno decarbonization without copper\u201d.7 The move to net zero is thus currently a core driver of the structural bull market in commodities and copper in particular is likely to see surging demand as the transition accelerates. Indeed, by some estimates global copper demand is projected to grow, in a baseline case, by around 600% by 2030 and perhaps by up to 900% in the event that the adoption of green technologies picks up significant pace8 \u2013 something that seems increasingly likely given the ongoing uncertainty around energy supplies caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Either way, the current decade is very likely to see the strongest growth in global copper demand on record and this growth may continue to accelerate as structural limitations on the expansion of renewable power generation and EV production are removed.9 EV copper demand scenarios Source: Bloomberg However, demand, of course, only tells half of the story. On the supply side, we are currently seeing a deficit representing around 3% of global demand.10 And while there are a range of named projects in the pipeline, these may be unlikely to significantly ameliorate supply issues before the end of the decade.11 Copper is a long cycle commodity \u2013 with two to three years to extend existing mines and up to eight to establish new projects \u2013 and despite the rally in copper prices over the last year, there are currently still no significant greenfield projects approved as a decade of weak returns and ESG scrutiny has dampened investment in future supply.12 Political issues may also have an impact in the coming years. While some copper is sourced from areas experiencing ongoing political turmoil, policy issues may also affect supply in more stable countries; for instance, the effect of the ongoing controversy regarding the increased taxation of mining firms in Chile is yet to be fully played out. Copper\u2019s broad range of uses, as well as its indispensability for decarbonization and the green transition, mean that demand is forecast to remain extremely strong for some time. Coupled with the supply issues discussed above, it seems the copper market is largely underprepared for the demand environment that we will see over the coming years, and low inventories \u2013 plus a weak US dollar \u2013 may well provide additional impetus. Prices are thus likely to be well supported for the foreseeable future. Copper supply and demand outlook DOWNLOAD THE PDF "

Stability is emerging as a priority for Chinese policymakers following uncertainty created by China\u2019s zero-Covid policy, regulatory crackdowns and slowing global growth Decarbonisation is a key theme: the government\u2019s commitment to being carbon-neutral by 2060 is opening investment opportunities outside the normal areas of electric vehicles and renewables Technology and innovation, the driving force for China\u2019s economy and equity market, is opening up opportunities in a range of sectors In the broader Asia region, a credit crunch for middle-market companies is creating openings for investors in private credit The following article is a summary of insights from our June 2022 Asia Conference. Learn more about investing in China It\u2019s been a year of volatility in Asian markets, especially China, as the Covid-19 pandemic has limited travel and made it more difficult for investors to discover what\u2019s happening on the ground. From geopolitics to China\u2019s zero-Covid policy and regulatory crackdowns, there has been plenty to worry financial markets. Yet there are signs the situation might be easing ahead of the important 20th Communist Party Congress in the autumn. 2022\u2019s concerns created a perfect storm for China equities, but markets there have recently rallied. As Covid cases have fallen and lockdowns lifted, so equities rose sharply in June. And while China\u2019s 5.5% gross domestic product growth target1 might appear challenging after the year\u2019s business disruption, Beijing is focused on restoring economic momentum. Politics lift equities Forceful policy measures are beginning to stimulate growth and lift equities. Notably, credit is loosening in areas such as housing. China equity markets usually track credit conditions. \u201cThinking ahead to the second half, there\u2019s a big put option on the market,\u201d explained Tessa Wong, Allianz Global Investors Product Specialist. \u201cAhead of the Party Congress, the priority will be stability.\u201d Speaking during AllianzGI\u2019s Asia Conference on 28-29 June, Wong reminded investors of the importance of taking a long-term perspective. The potential for higher returns comes with volatility, she noted. But previous corrections in 2008, 2016 and 2020 had ultimately proved to present buying opportunities. The areas where AllianzGI\u2019s analysts foresee sustained growth are linked to government policy priorities, including self-sufficiency, infrastructure and renewable energy. A commitment to decarbonisation Following President Xi Jinping\u2019s 2020 pledge to the UN General Assembly that China would be carbon neutral by 2060, Beijing\u2019s commitment to decarbonisation is well known. As the world\u2019s biggest CO2 emitter, responsible for almost a third (31%) of emissions2, it has a long way to go. \u201cPeople wonder why China committed to such a tight timeline,\u201d said Shannon Zheng, Research Analyst, \u201cbut environmental sustainability is important because China has a vast land mass and a high proportion of the world\u2019s population. Also, going to net zero fosters technological leadership, economic growth and energy self-sufficiency.\u201d The push for decarbonisation is creating further investment opportunities beyond the traditional areas of renewable energy and electric vehicles, she added. Technology to boost the economy \u201cTechnology will be the driving force for China achieving its goal of doubling GDP by 2035,\u201d noted Jason Hsu, Research Analyst. \u201cFurther, many companies are looking to technology as the enabler of their future growth \u2013 this creates some interesting investment opportunities.\u201d China\u2019s innovation is accelerating. It\u2019s now the largest market globally for electric vehicles, the leader in renewables, has the largest 5G network, has more than 1,000 new drugs in development, is the world\u2019s largest market for industrial robots and has performed the highest level of autonomous vehicle tests globally. Government policies to rein in consumer technology and focus instead on industrial technology have been reflected in equity prices. Private credit: demand outstrips supply Turning to the rest of Asia, Sumit Bhandari, Portfolio Manager, Asia Private Credit, highlighted the shortage of credit for middle-market companies. International banks have focused on larger firms since the global financial crisis, he said, while local banks have reached lending capacity limits. \u201cFrom an investor\u2019s perspective, we believe that this will be attractive, both for its returns and the low volatility because you are lending against cashflows,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis makes it much closer to the real economy, away from the financial markets.\u201d Rewards to come Summing up the conference, William Russell, Head of Product Specialists, Asia Pacific, emphasised the huge economic dynamism that can be forgotten amid volatility. \u201cOver 20 years, China equities have delivered three times the returns of European equities,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are patient, and use setbacks as opportunities, then typically the rewards will come.\u201d William Russell, Head of Product Specialists, Asia Pacific 1 Source: Bloomberg, 5 March, 2022 2 Source: Nature, 5 April, 2022: Nature.com Investing involves risk.

        "content": " Stewardship Principles Why German companies should embrace the role of lead independent director by Antje Stobbe | 04/07/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Recent examples of German supervisory boards adding the role of lead independent director (LID) are useful role models for their peers. A LID can help strengthen trust and improve communication between boards and investors. Additionally, it should foster independent, transparent and well-communicated succession planning, which can be lacking among German companies. Key takeaways A LID provides an independent point of contact for other board members, company executives, investors and other stakeholders who may be unable or unwilling to raise issues directly with the chairperson Within Germany\u2019s existing two-tier system of corporate governance there is a place for a LID, which does not conflict with the deputy chairperson position typically nominated by employees The LID should ideally chair the nominating committee1 and lead the process of appointing the chairperson\u2019s successor, which includes consultations with investors From a governance perspective, we favour a clear division of responsibility at the top of companies and a system of checks and balances on the board. Furthermore, we see value in having more than one channel of communication and engagement between boards and investors. The 2021 voting season saw the start in the German market of what could prove a new development across the country: two listed companies installed lead independent directors (LIDs) on their supervisory boards.2 As is typical in Germany, both have a two-tier board structure and in both cases the existing chairperson was considered non-independent. One case was Siemens Energy whose new chairperson was a former CEO of its parent company. In the other firm \u2013 Fresenius Medical Care \u2013 the chairperson had been a member of the board for more than 20 years.3 This year, SAP announced a LID role reacting to investor concerns related to the non-independent chairperson.4 Here, the purpose was also to facilitate investor dialogue. We welcome the introduction of this role in each of these cases and encourage other German companies to consider following suit. LIDs, also known as senior independent directors, are a key component of governance in a number of established markets. In France and the United States, the position is frequently used to counterbalance the combined role of chairperson and CEO. Additionally in the UK and Ireland, the role of LID is also well established on public company boards, irrespective of their leadership structure. However, installing a LID might appear less appropriate for the two-tier board system widely adopted in Germany, where the roles of chairperson and CEO are already separate. Some might also point out that Germany\u2019s co-determined boards5 already include a deputy chair elected by the employee representatives. Therefore, a LID might be viewed as not fitting naturally into the existing governance system. However, this fails to understand and appreciate the added value that role can bring. There are situations in Germany where the addition of a LID would help address areas of the current governance framework which may not be effectively addressed currently. What does a lead independent director do? As a fully independent member of the board, the LID provides counsel to the chairperson in \u201cnormal\u201d times and contributes to the effective functioning of the board. The LID is also an independent point of contact for other board members, company executives, investors and other stakeholders who may be unable or unwilling to raise issues directly with the chairperson. In times of stress or when the company is facing a crisis, the LID could be expected to help resolve the situation. This might involve liaising with external stakeholders, including investors, where this cannot be done effectively by the chairperson or company management. We also see the LID as instrumental in assessing the chairperson\u2019s performance and leading the process of nominating and installing a successor. Experience from other countries shows that a LID can be a valued intermediary between the chair or the board as a whole and investors. This is especially true when there are differing views on the best strategy ahead, where investors are dissatisfied with their interactions with the chairperson, or where the chair of the supervisory board is not considered independent. The role of the LID in the German context While we acknowledge that introducing the concept of a LID in Germany may not always be straightforward, there are several scenarios where the role could add value for companies and investors alike: During succession planning and the transition to a new chairperson, it is not always clear who investors should approach to discuss the future composition of the board. The outgoing chairperson is no longer the appropriate point of contact, and the deputy chairperson (usually an employee representative) is neither responsible for such decisions nor an objective representative of shareholder interests. In this situation, a LID \u2013 who should ideally chair the nominating committee \u2013 could lead the selection process for the new chairperson, representing an independent point of view and thus avoiding the involvement of the previous chair in the selection process. As such, the individual would provide an alternative channel of communication for investors and be a continuous point of contact in times of transition. Combining the role of LID with chairing the nominating committee should foster independent, transparent and well-communicated succession planning, which is lacking among German companies. Investors may have legitimate concerns over the chairperson\u2019s independence, qualifications or performance which can result in dialogue between them becoming confrontational. Acting as a valuable intermediary between the board, the chairperson and shareholders, the LID can enable investors to express their concerns and expectations openly, ensuring that the entire board is made aware of their views. Having an independent, objective channel to the board in these circumstances can allow honest and constructive conversations to take place. This ultimately builds trust between boards and investors. Periods of difficulty for companies and their boards can arise from the deteriorating global economy, litigation undermining public trust in company leadership, cases of large transactions that have attracted negative publicity or, as in the last couple of years, the Covid pandemic. In these situations, the chairperson may have adopted a position that is seen as too closely aligned with the management\u2019s strategic decision-making and is therefore perceived as lacking independence. In such instances, the LID can provide a means of communication between the board, management and investors, strengthening trust among investors and the wider public alike. Experience from other countries shows that, in difficult situations, a LID serving as chair of a combined nominating and governance committee can help to resolve litigation or other governance issues that could affect the company\u2019s valuation. An important addition to the governance framework We believe the role of LID can add significant value in the German system of two-tier, co-determined boards. It should be an independent role that complements the chair of the supervisory board. The LID should always chair the nominating committee but could also chair a combined nominating and governance committee with responsibility not only for succession planning and shareholder concerns, but also for broader governance and litigation issues. Most importantly, the role should not be a substitute for the chairperson. Rather, it exercises a complementary set of powers and responsibilities in the interests of the company and its investors. Once nominated, investors would expect the two roles of chairperson and LID to establish a constructive and practical division of responsibility that supports the distribution of tasks required of the two positions and helps them to exercise their roles effectively. Clear disclosure is required on the role and responsibilities of LIDs to assure investors about the scope of these tasks.

Key takeaways China\u2019s domestic challenges have coincided with broader geopolitical turbulence to fuel uncertainty about its ongoing growth story The Chinese government is already acting in response to several issues, and we expect further interventions to ensure continued growth We expect China to soften its stringent response to Covid outbreaks, recognising and reducing the economic impact Economic growth in China should have sufficient momentum for it to withstand the challenges it currently faces China has recently faced a perfect storm of challenges \u2013 both domestic and global \u2013 which it must overcome if it is to continue its trajectory towards becoming the biggest economy in the world. Yet historically, these periods of market turbulence have often turned out to present buying opportunities for investors. Our view is that this time China has built the momentum to help it deal with these setbacks, and these short-term challenges should not derail its long-term upward trend Navigating the perfect storm China\u2019s \u201cperfect storm\u201d incorporates a combination of factors that have arisen simultaneously: China seeking to maintain its zero-Covid policy in the face of the biggest Covid outbreak since the early days of pandemic Concern that the regulatory crackdown on China\u2019s tech giants will continue, depressing the prospects of firms that have driven growth Fears that China might face Western sanctions if it is perceived to side with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine The US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) indicating it would delist Chinese companies which had not complied with US laws relating to audit transparency Disappointment among investors in China that, while the government has committed to monetary and fiscal easing, this is not yet reflected in policy actions The Chinese government has acted to quell uncertainty. Key spokespeople have addressed many of the perceived threats, for example insisting that there is good dialogue with US regulators on potential delisting of ADRs (American Depository Receipts). They also recognise the need for greater stimulus within China and imply that the worst of any regulatory intervention should now be over. Other risk factors remain, however \u2013 including speculation that China may face Western sanctions given its reluctance to condemn the Russian government\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. But we think ultimately China will be careful to tread a diplomatic tightrope. Its export markets in the US and EU \u2013 worth USD 1 trillion in 20211 \u2013 are worth much more to it than its relationship with Russia (USD 65 billion2). As we reach the midpoint of 2022, we see four key ways in which China is facing down this perfect storm, and ensuring it remains positioned to continue its story of economic growth: 1. Phase 3 of China\u2019s development as a global power China is at a critical point in its development. A key facet of what we call Phase 3 of China\u2019s transformation \u2013 its establishment as a global power and development of diplomatic powers \u2013 will be its use of \u201csoft\u201d power to complement its economic strength. This is a delicate balancing act, but it will be critical to global stability over the next decade. China\u2019s Phase 3 also involves a shift in domestic focus as the country targets improved social equality to help support growth. Already, most Chinese firms still have a stronger domestic focus: around 90% of Chinese-listed companies\u2019 revenues come from within China3. As a wider number of Chinese citizens enjoy greater spending power, it should help shield the country\u2019s equity markets from the impact of broader geopolitical instability. 2. China\u2019s post-Covid landscape China was quick to apply a zero-Covid policy and, in the early days of the outbreak, the country looked like it would succeed in being first out of the pandemic. However, China responded to recent outbreaks of the Omicron variant by reverting to the restrictive approach it adopted in the early days of the pandemic. The lockdown in Shanghai alone affected 26 million people, causing significant disruptions to economic activity and curbing consumer spending. The impact also rippled outwards to impact local and global supply chains, limiting exports through Shanghai\u2019s busy harbour. While there are signs that the government could soften its zero-Covid stance to focus on a policy of \u201cfrequent mass testing\u201d, a full opening up seems unlikely until much later in the year, or into 2023. In the short term, ongoing Covid outbreaks will likely still affect economic activity, although not to the extent of the first half of this year. Although the GDP target of around 5.5%4 seems out of reach, nonetheless China is determined to restore economic momentum ahead of the important National Party Congress which will be held in the fourth quarter. President Xi will likely take the opportunity to highlight the overall data on Covid, which shows that the country registered fewer than 6,000 deaths while the US and Europe have each suffered over 1 million.5 3. Easing of government intervention Many Chinese stocks recently suffered because of twin threats: government intervention in the tech sector, and threats from the SEC to delist Chinese companies that fail to meet US auditing standards by 2024. Around 280 Chinese companies listed on US exchanges could potentially be affected, including several big-name tech stocks. But recently, China\u2019s Politburo (the country\u2019s top decision-making body) has announced plans to step up policy support, specifically for China\u2019s internet sector. Authorities may also allow Chinese companies to provide the access to audits that the SEC requires, which could potentially stave off the worst of the threat from the SEC\u2019s stance. Markets in China have been quick to respond positively, including a rebound in tech stocks. The government\u2019s relaxation of interventionist policy followed various easing measures already put in place this year. We have seen cuts to interest rates and the reserve ratio requirement (the level of liabilities that banks must hold), an easing of property curbs and an uptick in infrastructure spending. As Exhibit 1 shows, with banks being encouraged to expand loan growth, China\u2019s credit impulse index \u2013 typically a leading indicator for future economic activity \u2013 has already started to recover.

Ensuring economic momentum is sustained Domestic policy will likely prove the key influence on Chinese equities going forward. The government has previously ensured that underlying economic momentum is strong before taking steps to tackle underlying structural issues. There are parallels between the recent policy and market experience and that of 2018. Exhibit 2 highlights the changes in the debt to GDP ratio and P/E (price to earnings) ratio in Chinese firms. 2018 saw a tightening of policy as China clamped down on leverage in the shadow banking sector, resulting in a major derating. But a subsequent easing of policy led to valuations recovering and Chinese equities\u2019 growth story continuing. Again, 2021 saw another tightening of policy due to a clampdown on leverage, this time in the property sector. But we are starting to see a return to a more market-friendly policy setting, as China loosens monetary policy as most of the rest of the world tightens policy. This should be positive for China, as is evidenced by the recent stabilisation of A-shares performance. We anticipate that a recovery in economic momentum in the second half of 2022 should also be supportive for equity valuations as confidence returns.

Forecasts are inherently limited and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future results. Think thematically for growth China\u2019s long-term economic growth is likely to be underpinned by broad demographic, social and industrial trends in the country. And investors could capture these in thematic investment strategies that may complement core A-shares portfolios. For example, the Chinese government\u2019s strategic focus on self-sufficiency as it bids to deliver the tech infrastructure to underpin the country\u2019s projected growth may lead to opportunities in a range of industries, such as renewables, semiconductors and 5G. We expect this self-sufficiency to contribute to the ongoing improvement in quality of Chinese manufacturing, particularly through the enhanced use of robotics. More efficient and effective manufacturing processes may in turn help enable Chinese companies to win market share from foreign competitors, domestically and overseas. Elsewhere, a social shift in China could present some interesting stories for investors. Increased affluence among the Chinese public has seen a lifestyle evolution as consumers prioritise health and wellbeing. China has a long track record of pioneering medicine and healthcare going back thousands of years. This history is already translating into a burgeoning medical technology industry within China. More widely, the healthy lifestyle theme is further supported by growing demand for health-focused consumer products. Other thematic approaches could include renewable energy, while solar power and electric vehicles may benefit from the government\u2019s pledge to be carbon neutral by 2060, with CO2 emissions peaking in 2030. In addition, the financial reforms and ongoing liberalisation of China\u2019s capital markets may also benefit some companies in the financial services sector. Be alert: higher yields often come with higher volatility So far in the 21st century, Chinese equities have outperformed their European equivalents. As Exhibit 3 shows, returns from Chinese stocks have been about twice those of their European peers since 2000. But investors must accept that in China, higher yields come with higher volatility, and the chart also highlights several short-term periods of decline, like the one we have seen over much of the last year. Exhibit 3: MSCI China vs MSCI Europe Index \u2013 total return since 2000 (USD, rebased to 100) Source: Refinitiv Datastream, Allianz Global Investors, as at 3 June 2022. Based on total return performance in gross, USD from 31 Dec 2000. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Investors may not invest directly in an index.\u201d. It is clear that China\u2019s \u201cperfect storm\u201d weighed on the country\u2019s markets in late 2021 \u2013 and has continued to impact into 2022. But the Chinese government has already been clear in its response, and we expect further policy easing in coming months. Historically, extreme periods of volatility in China\u2019s equity markets have presented some long-term buying opportunities. Many stocks appear to have come back to valuation levels that we believe offer good long-term risk/reward potential. China\u2019s path to becoming the world\u2019s largest economy remains intact. As we look to the rest of the year and beyond, the individual company stories that are driving broader growth should present opportunities for those investors with the local expertise and on-the-ground knowledge to identify them.

A LID can help strengthen trust and improve communication between boards and investors. Additionally, it should foster independent, transparent and well-communicated succession planning, which can be lacking among German companies. Key takeaways A LID provides an independent point of contact for other board members, company executives, investors and other stakeholders who may be unable or unwilling to raise issues directly with the chairperson Within Germany\u2019s existing two-tier system of corporate governance there is a place for a LID, which does not conflict with the deputy chairperson position typically nominated by employees The LID should ideally chair the nominating committee1 and lead the process of appointing the chairperson\u2019s successor, which includes consultations with investors Load More "

        "content": " The crisis on our plates: finding potential in failing food systems by M\u00e9lissa Bourassi | 24/06/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary The war in Ukraine has highlighted that the current way of producing and consuming food is unsustainable. As the rising global population places greater demands on our food system, there is an urgent need to build a resilient and inclusive food ecosystem, meeting both planetary and social needs. Opportunities exist for investors across the value chain of global food production and distribution to help mitigate these risks. Key takeaways As highlighted by the invasion of Ukraine, pressures on the global food system are reducing availability, affordability and resilience A radical rethink is required to sustain rising populations and increasing consumption in a way that is fair to all, without simply producing more food A long-term view is crucial but complex, and the recent stresses on food systems have amplified the need for investors, businesses and policymakers to act Food is more than a simple source of nutrition \u2013 it supports human health, development and well-being. The challenge is that current food systems are failing on two fronts. They neither sustain the global population equitably nor maintain the natural regeneration of our ecosystem. Millions of people are undernourished at a time when roughly one-third of food produced is lost or wasted.1 Adding to this, the UN currently anticipates a global food crisis due to the situation in Ukraine. This comes amidst the most rapid inflation hikes for 20 years in some countries \u2013 one example being trade prices for vegetable oil jumping by almost 30%. Without a systemic transformation, we risk failing to meet the targets set by the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Not only is the sector a high emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs), but there is also the social impact of needing to feed an estimated population of 10 billion by 2050, more equitably and with greater resilience. Investors can play a role in directing capital towards building a more sustainable food ecosystem and supporting the shift towards a more inclusive, equitable future. Greater inclusivity as core to a resilient and sustainable food system Enough food is produced globally to meet the needs of an expanding population, whose average daily caloric intake has increased by 34% since 19472 . Yet around 800 million people globally suffer from hunger and three billion cannot afford a healthy diet3. We are currently off course to achieve the UN\u2019s 2030 Zero Hunger target which stems from the universal right to adequate food4. By 2030 840 million5 are expected to suffer from hunger. At the other end of the spectrum, an estimated two billion are overweight or obese and at high risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The global imbalance is clear. The challenge is not new but the Covid-19 pandemic, the invasion of Ukraine and increased frequency of extreme climate events have exposed the fragility of our food supply chain, and ultimately food insecurity. Ukraine is the source of millions of tonnes of maize and wheat that are key staples, especially in more vulnerable areas, such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, women and young people are also disproportionately lacking in access to healthy and affordable food. Empowering them is essential to create a more inclusive food system that benefits everyone. Achieving a deep transformation of food systems involves the recognition that they play a central role in contributing towards most of the 17 SDGs. Through powerful levers for transformation, sustainable food systems provide the opportunity for progress in achieving the SDGs by connecting society, environment and the global economy. Exhibit 1: the central role of food \u2013 touching upon each of the 17 SDGs Source: Allianz Global Investors and UN Sustainable Development Goals \u201cGlobal food production threatens climate stability and ecosystem resilience. It constitutes the single largest driver of environmental degradation and transgression of planetary boundaries.\u201d Source: Professor Dr Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, EAT Lancet Commission, January 2019 Sustaining a food system within planetary limits Scientists in 2009 named \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d as the limits within which humanity can safely operate, develop and thrive. We have overstepped six of these nine boundaries, yet far fewer than half of the world\u2019s 8 billion people have access to a balanced diet. A critical question is how do we feed a further 2 billion people by 2050 without placing additional pressure on climate and planetary boundaries? The challenge is immense: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations estimates that our food systems will have to produce 50% more food by 2050 but with fewer resources. The existing food system is caught in a trap of trying to increase agricultural productivity, while damaging soil and incurring reduced crop yields. To reverse this, we must minimise harm from food production, while accelerating practices that actively restore habitat, protect diversity and lower emissions. This is the concept of regenerative agriculture. Exhibit 2: feeding the world is taking a toll on the planet Sources: 1. UNEP.org; 2. FAO; 3. WWF; 4. OECD; 5. WEF; 6. New Chatham House report, supported by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Global shifts in food consumption and diet A key element to feeding the world\u2019s rising population sustainably is what and how much we consume. This touches upon three key topics: food loss and waste, healthier consumption and alternatives to higher-emitting food products. Globally, around 14% of food produced is lost between harvest and retail, and an estimated 17% of total global food production is wasted. Food loss and waste is estimated to contribute to 8-10% of total global GHG emissions. Furthermore, the estimated annual economic, environmental and social cost of food waste, according to the FAO, is USD 2.6 trillion. It is therefore legitimate to ask whether we need to significantly increase food production. Instead, how can we establish the even and equitable production and distribution of food, and direct any possible waste to those in need? Lack of food for some people, and the consumption of excess calories for others, are twin pressures on global healthcare resources. In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission outlined a universal reference diet to \u201cnurture human health and support environmental sustainability\u201d and flag the risks of failing to adapt. A year later, the commission addressed the topic of affordability of this universal reference diet. The key finding comprises three areas of focus: transitioning to a predominantly plant-based diet, halving sugar consumption and halving meat consumption. This last objective leads us to the need to consume protein differently. Global demand for protein is rising and is predominantly sourced from animal-based foods \u2013 meat, dairy and eggs. These are more energy-, land- and water-intensive and less calorie-efficient than plant-based proteins. For every 100 calories fed to animals, only 25 calories are produced in meat or dairy products. Lastly, overconsumption of meat is linked to rising levels of obesity and higher risk of NCDs, resulting in significant and rising financial costs to governments. Exhibit 3: from current diets towards healthy and sustainable diets Source: Allianz Global Investors, *Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (2018), **EAT-Lancet Commission planetary health diet (2019) The planetary health diet does not prescribe an exact diet. The composition of a balanced and healthy diet varies according to individual needs, culural context, locally available foods, and eating habits. Investing in food: three key opportunities Investors can play a critical role in sustainable food transition and meeting global sustainability goals. The World Economic Forum estimates a USD 15.2 billion funding gap for food system innovation that would support ending hunger, keeping emissions within a 2\u00b0C rise and reducing water use by 10%. Innovation is essential for all 17 of the SDGs as well as the core priorities of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. There are opportunities to direct capital to a sustainable food ecosystem in line with different investment objectives: 1. Materiality of non-financial information For investors seeking unconstrained universes, it will be important to identify evolving material ESG risks relating to the food ecosystem, including: Water intensity \u2013 rising scrutiny on water usage and management, especially for regions at high risk of drought Health regulation \u2013 public health and food safety are rising concerns for consumers and politicians alike. In addition, as obesity-related healthcare costs rise, companies could be at risk from new regulations, advertising restrictions, labelling requirements, product recalls and bans, and even higher taxation. 2. Screening \u2013 positive and negative Evolving regulation is likely to drive a focus on the sustainable food transition within sustainable investment offerings. For example, under the forthcoming MiFID regulation, there will be reporting requirements on Principal Adverse Impacts. PAI 8 covers \u201cemissions to water\u201d, meaning pollution by emissions generated by investee companies. Additionally, many companies are under pressure to disclose data for water-management strategies and for water-use intensity. 3. Impact-focused investing The triple challenge of providing safe, affordable and nutritious food for a growing population creates significant innovation opportunities. The potential to invest in \u201chandprint\u201d solutions are broad and expanding. While footprints are the environmental impacts of the processes that sustain us, handprints are positive changes \u2013 environmental and social impacts that we intentionally cause outside of our footprints. Below are some investment sub-themes attracting interest from investors: Precision farming solutions Circular economy \u2013 reducing waste through the redistribution of surplus edible food, recycling waste for animal feed and energy generation Flexitarian diets, and alternatives to meat protein and dairy Alternatives to existing commercial fishing Food-packaging solutions Affordable, nutritious and high-quality products Additionally, food has direct and indirect reach into many of the SDGs. As a result, the sustainable food theme lends itself to impact-focused SDG investment strategies that are fully transparent and intentional. Food for thought for investors The current challenges around food availability and inflation could be a taster of more sustained threats in the long term, and they should urge us to reconsider our food ecosystems in a just and collaborative way. Economic policy, government policy and regulation must support this re-evaluation with a coordinated agenda of innovative policies. This intervention needs to be a high priority for several reasons, including: influencing consumer behaviour and buying decisions, improving food provenance and governance, impacting pricing to better reflect the true all-in cost of food options, motivating a just transition for the agricultural sector and the development of targeted financing programmes. The transformative climate, health and geopolitical events seen in recent years have exposed the lack of resilience in the various value chains \u2013 with food production and distribution systems among the most notable \u2013 that are core to economic and social welfare. As we anticipate further unpredictable global events, now is the time to invest in a far more robust food ecosystem by contributing towards opportunities and innovations that embrace a sustainable, equitable and inclusive future for all. Glossary of key terms Food security \u2013 all people, at all times, need physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their food preferences and dietary needs for an active and healthy life (1996 World Food Summit). Food security encompasses four main dimensions: Food availability: the availability of sufficient quantities of food of appropriate quality, supplied through domestic production or imports Food access: access by individuals to adequate resources for acquiring appropriate foods for a nutritious diet. Food utilisation: adequate diet, clean water, sanitation and healthcare contributing to individuals reaching a state of nutritional well-being where all physiological needs are met Food stability: to be food secure, a population, household or individual must have access to adequate food at all times. They should not risk losing access to food as a consequence of sudden shocks (eg, an economic or climatic crisis) or cyclical events. Food safety \u2013 the conditions and practices along the entire food supply chain that preserve food quality and prevent contamination and food-borne illnesses, with the assurance that the food will not cause harm to the consumer. Food systems \u2013 all interactions and activities along the whole food value chain, from the production and processing to the distribution and consumption of food. Healthy diets \u2013 a diet that provides enough of each essential nutrient, high in fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts and grains, but lower in salt, free sugars and fats. Healthy diets help maintain or improve overall health (WHO). Malnutrition \u2013 the condition resulting from getting inadequate or unbalanced nutrition and encompasses both under-nutrition (lack of enough nutrients) and over-nutrition (getting more nutrients than needed). Malnutrition results in poor health conditions. Flexifood/flexi-diet/flexitarian \u2013 a plant-based diet allowing occasional meat dishes in order to reduce environmental impact and improve health. Planetary boundaries \u2013 based on a scientific approach from the Stockholm Resilience Centre, the planetary boundaries concept, introduced in 2009, defines the environmental limits within which humanity can safely operate and continue to develop and thrive for generations to come. Nine planetary limits have been identified as regulating the stability and resilience of the Earth system: climate change, biosphere integrity, ocean acidification, ozone depletion, atmospheric aerosol pollution, freshwater use, biogeochemical flows of nitrogen and phosphorus, land-system change, and release of novel chemicals. 2030 Zero Hunger target \u2013 Zero Hunger is Goal 2 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. It seeks to eradicate hunger by improving access to food, ending all forms of malnutrition and developing agricultural productivity sustainably by 2030, through eight sub-targets and 14 indicators to measure progress.

        "content": " China equities checklist: 8 reasons to stay invested 6/22/2022 Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on Twitter Share via email China\u2019s zero-Covid approach and regulatory challenges have unsettled markets, but we don\u2019t think they alter the long-term investment case. Renewed government policy support and a commitment to a high-tech, carbon-free economic future should encourage long-term investors to take a fresh look at China. Equities set to potentially benefit from pro-growth policies and a more stable backdrop Many investors have been nervously watching the volatility in Chinese equity markets, and their worries are understandable. But these ups and downs seem to be because of a few macroeconomic and geopolitical issues that appear unlikely to derail the long-term investment case for China. The economy may have slowed since mid-2021, but recently there has been a clear pivot to policy aimed at supporting economic growth. We expect that support to gain traction in the coming months. China equities typically track domestic liquidity closely, with potentially improved stock market performance following periods of increased access to credit. With the China Credit Impulse Index, which measures the credit cycle in the market, already picking up in 2022, we anticipate more stable market conditions as the economy is lifted by greater government spending and the outlook for corporate earnings improves. At the same time, an expected easing of some of the more restrictive Covid-19 measures should allow the benefits of policy easing to come through.

Investors cannot invest directly in an index. Long-term trend of foreign investors buying China equities intact Despite the negative news out of China, global investors have continued to add China A-shares (stocks of Chinese companies listed on exchanges in Shanghai or Shenzhen) to their portfolios. March 2022 marked the first instance of net selling in 17 consecutive months. The Chinese government helped lay the groundwork for greater cross-border investment with the launch of the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Connect schemes in 2014 and 2016, respectively: In \u201csouthbound\u201d trades, mainland China residents use the Shanghai or Shenzhen exchanges to buy Hong Kong-listed stocks Investors outside of mainland China can use the Hong Kong exchange to buy A-shares in Shanghai or Shenzhen (known as a \u201cnorthbound\u201d trade). China is expected to stay committed to further opening its markets to foreign investment in the coming years. Exhibit 2: monthly northbound net buying via Stock Connect since 2014 (in RMB bn) Source: Wind, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 30 April 2022. China\u2019s potential is not captured in world equity indices Despite China\u2019s growth and ambitions, we believe its significant economic potential is not fully reflected in global equity indices. Indeed, a key reason for the long-term trend of global investors adding to China A-shares is because of the relative mismatch between the historically low level of portfolio allocations and China\u2019s economic clout and market scale. As at 31 December 2021, the MSCI AC World Index had a 61.3% allocation to the United States and just a 3.6% allocation to China. As China\u2019s capital markets become increasingly integrated into the global financial system, we believe this gap should narrow. And over time we expect global investor allocations to China should continue to increase, in line with China\u2019s growing economic influence. Exhibit 3: key statistics on China and China equities Source: FactSet, MSCI, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research. Data as at 31 December 2021. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. Chinese stocks don\u2019t move in lockstep with other equity markets China\u2019s equity markets can be useful as a portfolio-diversification tool. A-shares have a correlation of 0.31 with global equities over the last 10 years, which means they move in different directions almost 70% of the time. In comparison, US and global equities have a correlation of 0.97. Therefore, holding China A-shares in a global portfolio may help generate a better overall risk return profile. Exhibit 4: historical correlation between major equity markets since 2012 Source: Bloomberg, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 30 April 2022. Correlation data is calculated based on historical return of respective MSCI indices for the past 10 years, using weekly USD return. China A-shares represented by MSCI China A Onshore Index; HK-listed China stocks by Hang Seng Chinese Enterprises Index; APxJ equities by MSCI AC Asia ex Japan Index; global emerging market equities by MSCI Emerging Markets Index; Japan equities by TOPIX Index; US equities by S&P 500 Index; European equities by MSCI Europe Index; world equities by MSCI World Index. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against losses. China equities exhibit higher volatility \u2013 and potentially higher returns over the longer-term Investing in China brings different risks and greater unpredictability compared with Western markets. The Chinese government\u2019s clampdown on the internet platform and property sectors in 2021 \u2013 and the subsequent economic slowdown \u2013 illustrate this point. But investors have historically been rewarded with long-term outperformance. Hypothetically, an investment in the MSCI China Index in the period from the end of 2000 to 30 April 2022 would have generated a 418% return in US dollar terms, more than double the return from European equities (MSCI Europe Index). In the past, moments of volatility like those seen recently have proved to be buying opportunities for many long-term investors.

Attractive valuations Chinese equities, both onshore China A-shares and offshore stocks listed in Hong Kong, are trading at valuations below the historical average. That suggests much of the negative news surrounding the economic slowdown is already priced in. Within the market, we see the pullback in recent months as a buying opportunity on a longer-term perspective for a growing number of high-quality stocks.

Innovation and transformation: key drivers of China\u2019s growth China has come a long way in a short time. Once known as the \u201cfactory of the world\u201d, it has shifted away from low-cost manufacturing towards the high-tech areas that are essential to its growth \u2013 and self-sufficiency. China is seeking to increase its level of self-sufficiency in critical technologies of the future such as semiconductors and other strategically important areas like domestic energy supply. A rapidly expanding middle class, increasing domestic consumption and high-tech innovation are all key ingredients of the China growth story. Exhibit 7: China\u2019s path to growth 1.

China\u2019s equity market offers multiple options for investment There are many ways for investors to buy shares of Chinese companies, with the capital markets much broader and deeper than many investors realise. This has become even more important during China\u2019s recent regulatory clampdown, which impacted some listings more than others \u2013 particularly US-listed American depositary receipts (ADRs) and select Hong Kong-listed companies. Investors also have access to a diversified range of sectors. Structural growth areas such as industrials, technology and materials are concentrated onshore, while internet and other traditional sectors such as real estate, utilities and energy are better represented in the offshore space. The multiple ways to invest and diversity in sectors are among the reasons why Chinese equities may provide an attractive investment option.

        "content": " Reasons for emerging-markets optimism by Richard House , Giulia Pellegrini | 08/06/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Armed conflict, financial woes and inflation shocks have contributed to a tricky 2022 so far for emerging markets. But a broader, systemic crisis is not anticipated for emerging-market debt, and there might be reasons for optimism about a recovery. Key takeaways Inflation, the invasion of Ukraine and debt woes have weighed on emerging markets in 2022 Factors behind debt crises in Russia and Sri Lanka are unlikely to be repeated elsewhere Investors can take heart from the potential for recovery, with emerging-market debt historically performing well during rising US interest rates Emerging markets have matured since past financial crises, but investors should remain selective Emerging markets suffered a terrible start to 2022. Inflation shocks, the invasion of Ukraine, as well as crises in Russia (a result of the invasion of Ukraine) and Sri Lanka have raised fears of a domino effect of debt defaults. Nevertheless, now that the US Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, if history is our guide, there may be reason for optimism. The JPMorgan Emerging Market Bond Index Global (EMBIG) was down just over 16% year-to-date through to 4 May. That poor performance has been led largely by an inflation spike that hit developing economies in 2021 and this year has spread to industrialised economies. Inflation coupled with the situation in Ukraine has sparked a commodity shock, driving the prices of everything from oil to wheat higher. However, the decision by the US central bank to raise rates modestly in March and then on 4 May with a more aggressive 50 basis points hike \u2013 its largest change in two decades and the first back-to-back increases since 1994 \u2013 may mark a potential turning point for emerging-market (EM) debt investors. Our analysis of the Fed\u2019s previous two interest rate increase cycles (in 2004 and 2016) and the impact of those actions on EM debt reveals that the asset class tends to perform poorly in the months leading up to the first Fed hike. That dynamic played out as expected in the first months of 2022, with the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global Diversified down about 10% from the start of the year to mid-March. However, EM debt performed quite strongly in the three quarters following the first Fed move in both 2004 and 2016 (see Exhibit 1). That suggests that by the end of the year, EM debt may reverse losses from before the Fed\u2019s first hike. So far, spreads against comparable US Treasuries have already moved lower from recent peaks, declining from about 525 basis points just before the Fed\u2019s March move to about 450 basis points in May. Exhibit 1: emerging-market debt has performed well after previous rate hikes Source: Allianz Global Investors, Bloomberg, JPMorgan. Data as at 9 May 2022. Chart depicts the J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global spread-to-worst. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For illustrative purposes only. Reasons to be anxious Of course, there are reasons why some investors remain understandably anxious. Russia is expected to default in what would be the first-ever delinquency by an investment-grade EM sovereign issuer. However, given Russia\u2019s ample foreign reserves and that fact that its crisis was caused by its government\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine, it\u2019s reasonable to expect that this unprecedented credit event is unlikely to be repeated by other investment-grade sovereign credits. Similarly, Sri Lanka\u2019s debt and political crisis is not a sign of broader systemic EM challenges but rather the result of poor policy choices, notably maintaining a soft currency peg \u2013 a foreign exchange regime that has been out of favour since Argentina\u2019s 2001 default \u2013 coupled with very loose fiscal policy that was financed via central bank money creation. Another reason to be constructive on EM debt is the fact that the asset class has significantly matured. Large current accounts coupled with the pegged exchange-rate systems that were common at the time were the primary causes of several crises in the 1990s. Now, EM economic metrics have improved. For example, in 2021, the aggregate current account among 69 of the 73 countries in the EMBI index (excluding four countries classified by the International Monetary Fund as special situations) was a surplus of 0.5% of economic output, a positive result not seen in the prior seven years, according to IMF data. Current accounts have fallen in step with increased savings rates, implying a diminished need to borrow in US dollars. The number of issuers has grown from about a dozen issuers two decades ago to more than 80 countries now issuing US-dollar debt. At the same time, the majority of EM debt is now issued in local currencies, making these issues less vulnerable to volatile exchange fluctuations. Selectivity can reveal opportunities Still, selectivity is key, as evidenced by the hit index-tracking strategies took when Russia was removed from indices. Today, emerging markets are largely split evenly between commodity exporters and importers as well as between investment-grade and high-yield issuers. Investors may favour commodity exporters in Latin America and oil producers in Africa and the Middle East, while underweighting commodity-importers in Asia, particularly China, in our view. Countries such as Ecuador, Costa Rica and Mozambique, undertaking IMF structural reform programs, are also worth consideration, in our view. Investors would also be wise to track environmental, social and governance (ESG) data, which could help spot potential opportunities and risks. For example, Turkey\u2019s governance scores fell the most among EMs in the past five years, foreshadowing a subsequent asset price decline. Likewise, deteriorating ESG metrics over the past year in such places as Kazakhstan and Belarus showed that these countries\u2019 debt issues would fare poorly. While EM debt has underperformed in 2022, there is reason for optimism that the asset class could recover as the year progresses. The combination of economic fundamentals that have significantly improved over the past decade and favourable valuations (both in terms of absolute yields and spreads) set the stage for opportunities for investors willing to take a selective approach.

        "content": " Diversity comes of age as an investment theme by Guirec Thouement | 07/06/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary The pandemic illustrated the fragility of diversity and inclusion, making it a critical sustainable investment topic. Investors and regulators alike are insisting that companies employ more diverse workforces from the top down. At the same time, investments are emerging that specifically target greater diversity \u2013 both within organisations and in wider society. Key takeaways The Covid pandemic exposed the modern economy\u2019s inequalities, sharpening the focus on social issues Diversity was negatively impacted by the pandemic, but is key to a resilient economic recovery and growth We expect diversity to be increasingly measured and integrated into investment decisions, which will be reinforced by evolving regulation Expanding diversity data will be integrated into screening, engagement, voting and investment solutions The notion of fairness in the capitalist economy is gaining ground \u2013 including equal treatment of individuals, communities and individual diversity categories.1 Arguments in favour of encouraging diversity are nothing new, but the pandemic revealed the fragility of the prior decades' apparent progress. In this report, we briefly introduce diversity\u2019s complex layers and identify the lessons learned during the pandemic regarding gender diversity \u2013 the most advanced diversity typology. Furthermore, we discuss how investors can integrate diversity into investment decisions and active asset management. Understanding the breadth of diversity While articles and reports refer extensively to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), it is often narrowly applied as a concept. There is a breadth and depth to diversity, both in terms of the range of different communities affected and the various issues that impact them. Without education and understanding, many people in the broader population may not be aware of how the issue of \u201cdifference\u201d affects their behaviour towards, or perceptions of people and communities. To explain DEI\u2019s breadth, the term diversity is commonly linked to gender, gender identity, ethnicity, age, religion or sexual orientation. It also encompasses education, language, disability (mental or physical) and geography. Failure to support DEI takes many forms and is often unintentional, although it\u2019s important to recognise that legal provisions exist, but sometimes prove a hindrance. Formal recognition of diversity types, and understanding of the causes of non-inclusion, can foster development of appropriate processes and strategies that embed greater inclusion. Lessons from the last two years Looking at how the Covid pandemic affected diversity progress brings the lack of gender diversity back into the spotlight as this period had a particularly adverse impact on women. A study from The Lancet covering the first 18 months of the pandemic up to September 2021 showed that 26% of women experienced \u201cemployment loss\u201d versus just over one in five men.2 Similar findings of increased job losses for women came from a World Bank3 report. The added burden on women of caring for others resulted in the pandemic experience widening a persistent employment gap. According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO)4, the current global labour force participation rate for women is just under 47%, while for men it\u2019s 72%. This difference of 25 percentage points extends in some regions of Africa, the Middle East and South Asia above 50 percentage points. Beyond the employment gap is the salary gap. The unadjusted pay gap averages 20% globally, according to the ILO. Yet this understates how much less women are paid because it does not take into account a range of relevant factors such as type of occupation, education and experience that might give a truly accurate picture of the wage differential. Data for this \u201cadjusted\u201d pay gap is very limited. The key question arising from the experience of women in the pandemic is: if progress on gender diversity was challenged, how much more difficult was it for other under-represented groups to advance? Answering this question fully requires broader and more granular data. But the issue leads to a more general point: it\u2019s logical to assume that equality of access and opportunity for all groups could narrow the labour force\u2019s current gaps in skills and employment. The evolution of diversity as an investment theme Investors now take a holistic view of sustainability concerns, expecting that issues such as diversity are embedded into the values of asset management firms. Increasingly, asset managers are using publications like sustainability or stewardship reports to disclose their own diversity data as well as how they have engaged with investee companies and cast proxy votes on this issue. The social case for greater inclusion is clear and there is significant academic evidence aligning it to stronger financial performance.5 Consequently, many investors now regard limited gender diversity in investee companies as a risk and have raised their expectations on the extent to which diversity is integrated into investment decisions. Corporate diversity data nearing critical mass Data providers and investors are increasingly screening companies for diversity information, requiring greater disclosure. Regulators are likely to reinforce the requirement for greater disclosure (see later section). We expect required data to be aggregated at company and board levels at the very least, with periodic and consistent reporting. Companies failing to provide appropriate disclosures, strategic focus or meet certain thresholds may find themselves \u201cscreened\u201d out or \u201cvoted against\u201d. However, diversity is a complex topic and there are data access hurdles facing investors in certain geographies. Engaging with companies on diversity issues is often necessary to overcome these obstacles and better understand an organisation\u2019s diversity profile, strategic focus and governance of the topic. The information investors seek typically includes formal strategy statements, clear processes, board member responsibility, a link to compensation and, where required, pathways to strengthen a company\u2019s position. Driving positive change through active stewardship Engagement takes place either bilaterally or in collaboration with other investors. Allianz Global Investors (AllianzGI) actively uses its proxy voting rights and usually votes against re-election of the chair of the nominations committee of large-capitalisation companies in developed markets if women make up less than 30% of the board.6 We also expect nationality and ethnic diversity to appropriately reflect a business\u2019s geographic footprint and employee and customer profile. For example, AllianzGI would not support re-election of the chair of a large-cap listed US company\u2019s nominations committee if there was not at least one board member from an under-represented ethnic group. This rule will also be implemented in the UK next year Collaborative engagement is also a powerful tool. In 2021, AllianzGI joined the 30% Club Investor Group in France, which aims to increase female representation at leadership levels of large listed domestic companies. The role of regulation Regulation on diversity is evolving. A growing number of states in the US and the EU now insist on a minimum percentage of women at board level, and there is rising pressure to improve disclosure (see Exhibit 1). For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission7 is planning to publish amendments to disclosure regulation this year to improve transparency into the composition of the workforce, including diversity, aligning with Nasdaq rule changes related to board diversity and disclosure.8 The European Commission recently proposed9 a new directive updating the current text on equal pay, with new dispositions to improve pay transparency, including adjusted pay gaps. Exhibit 1: gender diversity KPIs for MSCI ACWI index constituents (database of 2,753 companies) Source: MSCI, as at 10 March 2022 Growing opportunities to invest for greater diversity Away from screening for weak diversity \u201cfootprints\u201d, there are increasing opportunities to invest in companies with a broad and positive diversity \u201chandprint\u201d \u2013 those companies that have a positive impact in society beyond their own footprint. For this reason, diversity lends itself to impact investing where a positive measurable benefit is targeted. Emerging opportunities include social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds. These debt instruments can direct capital either to specific diversity projects or provide capital for a company that is committed to stated diversity goals. For instance, the Social Bond Principles specifically aim to address social issues related to diversity.10 For example, an emerging-markets telecoms operator has issued a sustainability bond to fund information and communication technology training for women, boosting their participation in the digital economy. In the US, Fannie Mae\u2019s Sustainable Bond Framework makes home ownership and rental possible for millions of Americans, specifically including underserved communities.11 Many of the available instruments and sustainable investment offerings use the United Nations\u2019 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a framework. SDGs 5 and 10 specifically address gender diversity and reduced inequalities, but SDG 3 (Good health and Well-being), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) can have meaningful ancillary benefits for inclusion, especially in resource-constrained, lower-income economies. In 2019, the Global Impact Investing Network published its Gender Lens Investing Overview12, which provided a framework for investors which could similarly be adapted to improve other workplace diversity weaknesses To conclude, the pandemic not only illustrated the fragility of diversity but also brought it to centre stage for the investment community. The momentum for investors to act as change agents for greater diversity in workforces, as well as wider society, is significant and still growing. In many ways, the present time will prove to be a coming of age for DEI. Download the pdf version Read more about our sustainable investing themes 1.

        "content": " In the fight against inflation, consider these sectors and styles by Michael Heldmann | 01/06/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary During periods of disruptively high inflation, investors may want to rethink their allocations to certain equity sectors and investment styles. For example, the energy and consumer discretionary sectors have historically fared better than consumer staples and utilities during inflationary periods. The value, momentum and quality styles have also done well, on average. Key takeaways Companies in the energy and materials sectors (among others) have closer links to physical assets and commodities, so their asset values and product prices tend to rise when inflation does Investors who employ style investing may want to consider value, momentum and quality: research shows that they have tended to outperform during inflationary periods Among the factors pushing inflation to the highest level in decades: the global pandemic has disrupted global supply chains in general, while the invasion of Ukraine has specifically disrupted the supply of energy, fertiliser and grain With inflation near its highest levels in a generation, many investors want to know how a prolonged period of inflation might affect the financial markets \u2013 and their portfolios. Looking back at market performance over time, we can see that when inflation is high, some sectors (such as energy) have historically fared much better than others (such as utilities). This is often linked to the fact that some companies set prices while some \u201ctake\u201d prices. There is also solid research showing that certain investment \u201cstyles\u201d (including value and momentum investing) have also tended to outperform in inflationary periods. That\u2019s why it may make sense for investors to form their inflation-fighting strategies by differentiating not only between traditional sectors, but investment styles as well. With inflation set to remain high, where can investors turn? Although periods of high inflation are not unusual to the economic cycle, there are aspects of this particular inflation cycle that are very different. The global pandemic has disrupted global supply chains in an unprecedented manner. And the invasion of Ukraine by Russian armed forces has disrupted the supply of energy, fertiliser and grain. These factors have conspired to increase prices at the highest rate seen in decades. On top of that, the pandemic has also profoundly changed the labour market. This has led wage inflation and made inflation more persistent. So how can investors form a defense against inflation? Equities have historically performed relatively well in times of economic expansion and modest inflation. Although equities may suffer a short-term downturn when inflationary expectations increase, they are generally viewed as a good \u201chedge\u201d against inflation in the long-term. But equities are not all the same, and it is worthwhile to drill down and see how different sectors are affected by inflation cycles. Different sectors have responded differently to inflation Let\u2019s start with an industry-level view of the US economy \u2013 which is where we find the most robust inflation data. Exhibit 1 shows US sector sensitivities to inflation (as measured by changes in the US Consumer Price Index) for US stocks as a whole (as measured by the MSCI USA Index). Of note: Companies in certain sectors (such as energy and materials) tend to own or control physical assets; they may also sell commodity-based products. Since the value of their assets and the prices of their products increase with inflation, their stock prices are positively correlated with inflation. That means that typically, their stock prices move higher when inflation moves higher. Conversely, companies in sectors such as consumer staples and utilities have negative correlations with inflation. That\u2019s in large part because these companies consume commodities, which increases their input prices. On average, this has adversely affected their profit margins and stock prices. Exhibit 1: identifying sectors with positive (or negative) correlations to inflation Sector sensitivities to changes in US CPI (MSCI US Index, April 2022) Source: Allianz Global Investors. Data as at March 2022. Drilling a little deeper, one might ask if some companies within an industry are more affected by inflation than others. Now, we\u2019re entering the realm of active portfolio managers and their ability to seek to identify the winners. Consider that some companies can increase prices and pass their increased costs on to consumers. Active investors can aim to identify such companies by closely following changes in sales and profit margins \u2013 looking for high-quality companies with large and stable profit margins since they tend to do better in times of high or increasing inflation. Different styles have also reacted differently to inflation Many investors employ style investing in an attempt to achieve higher returns than the broad market on average. How does style investing do in times of high inflation? Researchers in the Systematic Equity team at Allianz Global Investors examined the performance of several well-known equity style factors during eight periods of high inflation in the United States since 1940. Exhibit 2 plots the average returns in excess of a capitalisation-weighted market benchmark for three equity styles: value, momentum and quality. Attractively valued stocks (known as value stocks) outperformed the benchmark in six of eight periods. Stocks selected based on their performance during the previous 12 months (known as momentum stocks) on average continued their streak, and also outperformed the benchmark in six of eight periods. These stocks had higher average excess returns in inflationary times than in normal times. More profitable companies or those with a better balance sheet (known as quality stocks) outperformed the benchmark in four of the six periods for which data was available.

What it means for investors Here are four takeaways that investors may want to keep in mind: Although equities may suffer a short-term downturn when inflationary expectations increase, they are generally viewed as a good \u201chedge\u201d against inflation in the long-term. Companies in the energy and materials sectors have historically had a positive correlation with inflation, which means the value of their assets and the prices of their products tend to increase as inflation rises. Within sectors, some companies are in a better position to increase prices and pass their increased costs on to consumers \u2013 and active asset managers can seek to identify these companies by closely following changes in sales and profit margins. Historically, the value, momentum and quality investment styles have tended to outperform in inflationary periods.

        "content": " Inflation is back and so is momentum investing by Dr. Michael Stamos, CFA , Nicolas Hengstebeck, MBA | 30/05/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary After decades of slow price growth across developed markets, inflation has now reached its highest levels in more than 40 years. Investors worry about how to preserve their wealth and generate real returns in this inflationary environment. One proven option is the exploitation of momentum investing across asset classes. Key takeaways We have recently begun experiencing inflation pressures not seen for 40 years. Unsurprisingly, in the past couple of months real assets such as commodities have done well, but so have Cross-Asset Momentum-type strategies. On the other hand, equities \u2013 and not just bonds \u2013 produced some losses. Our long-term analysis, going back to 1964, shows that the above matches with what has happened in past episodes of high inflation. Our interpretation of why momentum is doing well is that high inflation is in fact akin to momentum in consumer prices. This consumer price momentum leads to persistent reactions in the economy, central bank actions and private investment decisions, that in turn drive market-price trends. Even before the invasion of Ukraine by Russian armed forces in February 2022, inflation was a topic of public concern and discussion. Indeed, inflationary pressures started building in the summer of 2021, when global supply chains were interrupted because of measures triggered by the global pandemic. At the onset of rising inflation, authorities were convinced of its transitory nature, and expected a fairly quick return to target levels of about 2%. However, inflation today is much higher than expected, and is forecasted to remain above the levels of recent decades for the foreseeable future. Given the challenges investors face to achieve real returns with reasonable risk appetites in an inflationary environment, we conducted an analysis of which factors and strategies are likely to enable investors to preserve their wealth, and generate satisfactory real returns, during such periods. Our analysis shows that a sophisticated momentum strategy across asset classes and geographies is a good approach to consider, particularly if one expects inflationary pressures to persist over the medium term. Inflation Continues to Surprise on the Upside After decades of low inflation across developed markets, recent inflationary pressures have reached levels unheard of for generations. While these observations are worrying, and pose challenges for investors looking for real returns it is important to differentiate within the analysis between headline inflation and core inflation rates. Core inflation rates usually exclude more volatile components of the inflation basket, such as food and energy prices, which in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine are the main drivers of current headline inflation rates. However, even looking at only core inflation rates, we currently observe these at over 6% in the US, and above 3% in the euro area. Current forecasts by central banks expect inflation to stay elevated at least during 2022, and anticipate \u2013 compared to what we have become used to in recent years and decades \u2013 a somewhat higher inflationary environment in the medium term. Conscious of the fact that previous inflation forecasts have grossly underestimated the current inflationary environment, investors should think about strategies to preserve wealth, and generate real returns. One proven option is the exploitation of momentum investing across asset classes. Chart 1: Recent acceleration of inflation in the USA (Annual US Consumer Price Index Growth) Source: Allianz Global Investors, Bloomberg using US Consumer Price Index Urban Consumers seasonally adjusted index as of May 2nd, 2022. Momentum-driven Investing with Strong Tailwinds Momentum or trend investing1 is based on a simple idea: the performance of an asset will continue in the same direction. An asset\u2019s price that has increased will continue to increase. An asset\u2019s price that has decreased will continue to decrease. Momentum, defined as the performance of an individual stock over the past 12 months, was first studied in detail for individual equity market securities. Carhart (1997)2 expanded Fama-French\u2019s pioneering Three-Factor Model (market, size, value) (1992)3 to include momentum. These and other researchers identified positive- and negative-trend continuation that, on average, lasts around three to 12 months. Since then, this definition of momentum has been adopted as the standard, with one variation \u2013 the 12 months excludes the most recent month, in order to appropriately reflect short-term reversal effects, or delayed implementation of the momentum signal in the portfolio. Momentum investing can yield considerable returns by exploiting trend-following patterns in capital markets. Using this definition of momentum, Asness et al. (2013)4 also examined stock market indices, bond market indices, commodities and currencies, and found evidence of trend continuation patterns. Our analysis of historic data supports the claim that momentum investing can yield considerable returns, by exploiting trend-following patterns in capital markets. Only periods where we see strong trend-reversal patterns pose challenges to momentum investing. Nevertheless, on a medium-term and particularly on a long-term horizon, momentum investing usually generates strong performance patterns. Today it is interesting to observe that trend-following strategies did very well in the recent period. For instance this can be seen in the performance shown in Chart 2. The depicted BarclayHedge CTA Index tracks the performance of so-called CTA funds since 1981 and recently made new all-time highs. CTA funds are a category of funds that are able to go long and short different asset classes. We believe what helped them was the ability to capture the down-trend in bond markets and the up-trend of commodities markets. Chart 2: Momentum Investing with strong track record recently after a flat stretch: Performance of CTAs over time Source: Allianz Global Investors, Bloomberg using BarclayHedge CTA Index as at April 30th Long-Term Analysis: Asset Class and Factor Returns in Inflationary Periods Based on our observations that inflation rates in developed markets are likely to stay elevated for the foreseeable future, we asked ourselves how asset classes and factor strategies have performed during previous periods of high inflation. In our analysis, we reviewed the past 58 years of available data in the US. We began with 1964 due to the availability of asset class and factor returns data since then, and because it seems reasonable to omit the post-war period. For asset classes, we use Ibbotson database returns, except for commodities where we use the Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index; for equity risk premia we use the data from Prof. Ken French\u2019s website (Kenneth R. French - Data Library (dartmouth.edu)). As for Cross-Asset trend-following, we compute our own index based on our proprietary trend-following model that is applied to eight major asset classes: Ibbotson US Large Cap Index, Ibbotson US Small Cap Index, Ibbotson US High Yield Index, Ibbotson US Corporates Index, Ibbotson US Government Bonds Index, Oil Futures Index, Gold Futures Index, US Dollar Index. We use our own proprietary model as there is no CTA index that stretches back to before 1981. However, the period before 1981 had the highest inflation readings in modern history; we are thus particularly interested in these years. To make the performance of all investment options comparable, we scale all asset class returns to have a volatility of 10 percent. We focus on high-inflation years, defined as years with a consumer inflation of above 5%. Such years have been relatively rare as can be seen in Chart 1; overall, we counted 12, which amounts to roughly one-fifth of the entire dataset. 2021 was obviously one such year, with 7.0 percent inflation; before that, we have to go back to 1990 with 6.1 percent, and then 1981 with 8.9 percent inflation. 1981 was the last of a string of high-inflation years, beginning with 1969. We find that commodities delivered the best excess returns above cash, with 16.4 percent on average during high-inflation years. This tallies somewhat with the common wisdom that commodities are in fact part of consumer price indices and production price indices. The second-best result is generated by the simulated Cross-Asset Momentum strategy, that has produced an excess return (above cash) of 9.7 percent. On the other end of the spectrum are traditional asset classes such as bonds and equities, which delivered negative excess returns in the range of -2 to -8 percent. The fact that momentum investing can deliver in years when major asset classes have a negative return makes it more valuable during these periods. Also noteworthy is that other equity risk premia have a positive return in inflationary times, and that single-stock momentum delivered the second-best return. While these results may be surprising to some, particularly when incorporating the magnitude of outperformance of Cross-Asset Momentum vs. other factors, such as value, profitability, small cap or even single-stock momentum, we believe that these observations can be intuitively explained. The most straightforward explanation relates to fixed income markets. In an environment of high and rising inflation, central banks are usually required to increase interest rates, thereby triggering a trend of declining prices for fixed income instruments, and therefore forming a strong negative trend across fixed income markets. When thinking about commodity markets and the role that input prices for commodities play in the context of headline inflation, we also usually observe a correlation between high and rising inflation rates and rising commodity prices in a positive trend pattern. For equity and currency markets the situation can be more varied and depend to some extent on factors other than inflation, such as geopolitics or economic issues. Chart 3: Excess-Return p.a. (%) in years with high inflation (inflation > 5% during 1964\u20132021) Source: Allianz Global Investors. For asset classes, we use Ibbotson database returns, except for commodities where we use the Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index; for equity risk premia we use the data from Prof. Ken French\u2019s website. As for Cross-Asset trend-following, we compute our own index based on our proprietary trend-following model that is applied to eight major asset classes: Ibbotson US Large Cap Index, Ibbotson US Small Cap Index, Ibbotson US High Yield Index, Ibbotson US Corporates Index, Ibbotson US Government Bonds Index, Oil Futures Index, Gold Futures Index, US Dollar Index. We use our own proprietary model as there is no CTA index that stretches back to before 1981. Table 1 shows a deeper dive into performance patterns during high-inflation years. It is interesting to see the hit ratio on the high side for commodities and Cross-Asset Momentum. With respect to diversification benefits relative to bonds and equities, it is commodities, Cross-Asset Momentum and single-stock momentum that have the lowest and negative correlations. Table 2 presents annual returns for each individual high-inflation year. It can be seen that there is no absolute certainty and that, even if an inflation hedge performs well on average during these periods, the hedge may not work each and every year. Sometimes there are even sizeable drawdowns.

For investors to hedge portfolios against losses in real terms, we recommend considering asset classes and strategies that have a proven performance pattern in inflationary times. It is also important to scrutinize the overall portfolio allocation, and to have a risk-factor mix that allows performance in inflationary times, but also not to lose sight of non-inflationary times. We believe that bespoke momentum-based strategies can be a strong return contributor in all market phases that exhibit strong trends when it comes to economic growth or inflation. This is because extended moves in the real economy are likely correlated with strong momentum in asset prices. Furthermore, Cross-Asset Momentum has the potential to perform independent of market direction, as these strategies are not bound to go long only but may also go short in markets with negative trends.

For example, the energy and consumer discretionary sectors have historically fared better than consumer staples and utilities during inflationary periods. The value, momentum and quality styles have also done well, on average. Key takeaways Companies in the energy and materials sectors (among others) have closer links to physical assets and commodities, so their asset values and product prices tend to rise when inflation does Investors who employ style investing may want to consider value, momentum and quality: research shows that they have tended to outperform during inflationary periods Among the factors pushing inflation to the highest level in decades: the global pandemic has disrupted global supply chains in general, while the invasion of Ukraine has specifically disrupted the supply of energy, fertiliser and grain Load More "

        "content": " From bridges to broadband: building opportunities in infrastructure debt by Claus Fintzen | 25/05/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Propelled by governments\u2019 bid to support the economic recovery from Covid-19, booming demand for digital services and the push to a greener economy, infrastructure spending is ramping up. That should create opportunities for institutional investors seeking stable, long-term cash flows. Key takeaways As a portfolio diversification option, infrastructure debt has much to offer investors and the long-term prospects look strong: USD 94 trillion of investment is needed by 2040 While transport infrastructure is gradually shaking off the effects of the pandemic, rising interest rates will present fresh challenges for companies and projects Batteries, hydrogen and biofuels are areas to focus on within the green economy as such investments are usually financed by debt Digital infrastructure offers significant opportunity as countries like Germany and the UK catch up in the shift to fibre-optic broadband From financing bridges to broadband, infrastructure debt is a growing asset class with much to offer investors. As well as its built-in illiquidity premium \u2013 an additional compensation for investors in return for tying up investment in an asset that cannot easily be converted to cash \u2013 infrastructure debt also offers portfolio diversification opportunities and a tangible way to boost economies and improve societies. And the long-term prospects are strong. Global infrastructure investment needs to rise to USD 94 trillion by 2040 to keep pace with economic growth and meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals, estimates the G20 Global Infrastructure Hub (see Exhibit 1). To seize the opportunities in the infrastructure-debt realm, we suggest that investors focus on five areas \u2013 from rising interest rates to regulation. 1. Rising interest rates pressuring borrowers down the road When financing a company or project, investors need to consider what the terms might be in the future when repayment is due. Issuers have taken advantage of the low interest rate environment of recent years to increase leverage. Higher interest rates could pose a hurdle for many companies - including those in the infrastructure sector - that need to refinance their debt in an environment of much higher interest rates. Will they then be able to service their debt while maintaining their investment grade status? At the same time, even though rates are on the rise, we\u2019re still in a low-yield environment. Under these conditions, infrastructure debt can still provide significant benefits to investors with a buy-and-hold mentality. Infrastructure projects are inherently long-term illiquid sustainable assets, and their illiquidity premium may provide superior yields to many sovereign or covered bonds. How we can help As Europe\u2019s first infrastructure debt financier, Allianz Global Investors has the experience to carry out the necessary due diligence to manage risks and understand how these conditions may impact our investments. With our focus on longer-dated duration assets, we seek to actively navigate the potential for rising interest rates by putting in place structural protections that can provide capital stability to investors. 2. Infrastructure projects hurt by Covid-19 should recover \u2013 but gradually Passenger traffic came to a virtual standstill when the pandemic broke out, hitting transport infrastructure. Many airports, toll roads and other \"essential assets\" did not have sufficient ongoing cash flow to continue servicing their debt. In some cases, shareholders have been asked to step in, while other companies have had to negotiate with their banks to extend the liquidity line or draw on existing credit lines to bridge this period. Therefore, the liquidity position of these assets is a key factor. Consider these different sectors: Airports: passenger numbers are likely to recover to pre-pandemic levels, but airports with a high share of intercontinental traffic will need more time. We expect the impact on airports to continue for three years before possibly returning to 2019 levels Road traffic: traffic volumes fell by 90% during the lockdowns. After the restrictions were lifted, however, traffic quickly returned to pre-pandemic levels. Public transport: this sector has suffered, but has shown great resilience, thanks to the support and financial backing of municipalities. These important services will continue in some shape or form as people return to normal life after the pandemic. How we can help The expertise and deal sourcing capabilities of our Infrastructure Debt team allowed us to successfully navigate the market turbulence caused by Covid-19. We added EUR 2.2 billion of investments in 2020. We were able to build on that in 2021 by completing 14 transactions, amounting to EUR 2 billion. In 2022 we are identifying opportunities for our clients from an expected increase in the volume of mergers and acquisitions as businesses recover. Exhibit 1: Global infrastructure spending: current trends vs investment need Source: Global Infrastructure Outlook outlook.gihub.org 3. Transformation to a sustainable footing Many investors are interested in green bonds and renewable energy investments as part of the push to a carbon-neutral economy. This also reflects the increasingly widespread pressure to take ESG (environmental, social and governance) considerations into account in investment decisions. The current political situation also underpins the drive to significantly increase the share of renewable energy. Green bonds, which support specific climate-related projects and renewable energy, are being swamped by demand. As a result, financing terms have softened so that some can no longer be considered investment grade. This may mean that in some transactions where there is strong investor demand, lenders receive less protection. Therefore, investors should be very selective in choosing their transactions. Over the years, the industry has made significant progress in its understanding of ESG. However, investing in ESG \"friendly\" assets only leads to net zero up to a point. Sustainability-minded investors should favour investments that support a holistic transformation of the company and should seek to support other issuers on their \"green\" journey. We see particular opportunities in the area of emerging energy technologies \u2013 such as batteries, hydrogen and biofuels \u2013 as companies can invest in new areas and thus reduce their CO2 emissions (see Exhibit 2). Such investments are usually debt financed to optimise the return on equity. How we can help We help the companies we invest in focus on a holistic transformation, while recognising that overnight change can be difficult. For example, when investing in an energy company we may seek to provide covenants within financing documents pledging to increase the company\u2019s use of renewable energy \u2013 hence, moving the business to a more sustainable footing. We are actively seeking similar opportunities where we are helping to put our economy on a net-zero trajectory.

Be prepared for regulatory changes The infrastructure debt asset class is being affected by the increasingly large focus on regulation overall, and by regulators\u2019 desire to provide investors with more transparency and information. For example, the European Commission is intensively pushing the issues of sustainability and climate change \u2013 and, like other asset classes, infrastructure debt is having to adapt. One result is the EU taxonomy - a classification system designed to provide a common wording and a clear definition of \"sustainable\" business activities. This is intended to guide investments to achieve the European Union's 2030 climate and energy targets. Meanwhile, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) requires funds to disclose how they are increasingly incorporating sustainable practices into their activities and clearly defines which strategies qualify as sustainable investments. Infrastructure debt investors can play a critical role in addressing the climate crisis and achieving carbon neutrality. However, the challenge with unlisted companies is often that ESG information is not as easily accessible as it is for listed firms. In addition, many industries have not yet defined common methodologies, reporting guidelines and metrics, making it difficult to assess progress. Investors, therefore, have to spend a lot of time and resources gathering information from borrowers on areas such as greenhouse gas emissions or alignment with the EU taxonomy. How we can help We work hard to ensure we fully understand the EU taxonomy and other regulations which are changing at increasing speed. As there\u2019s no standard way of accessing information, we conduct our own detailed due diligence and we are also an active member of the GRESB, (Global ESG Benchmark for Real Assets) an investor-led organisation which provides a solid database of ESG information collected from issuers. This can help investors focus on building a portfolio of sustainable assets. 5. Digital: growing demand for the infrastructure of the future In the infrastructure sector, digital assets are in greater demand than ever before. Fibre-optic networks and data centres are particularly sought after. However, the Covid-19 pandemic, with a sharp increase in video conferencing for businesses and streaming services for the home, also highlighted the deficits in digital infrastructure. In Germany and the UK, for example, fibre-optic represents only around 6% of total fixed broadband, according to the OECD. That\u2019s compared to more than 80% in the market leaders of South Korea and Japan. But Germany, the UK and many other large economies are seeking to significantly ramp-up their broadband capabilities. However, there are many more nuances to consider when it comes to business models. This is because competition for digital infrastructure has increased significantly. For investors, the market segment presents exciting opportunities, but also harbours risks. Long-term investors therefore need to take a close look at the assets they invest in to ensure that they are appropriately positioned to respond quickly and adequately to a changing environment as market conditions change. How we can help We are focused on helping our clients navigate a fast-growing sector with dynamics that may be unfamiliar to some investors. With a traditional infrastructure provider, such as a utility supplier there is often certainty about revenues as homes are already connected to the power grid. But with a digital asset, like a fibre-optic network, there is sometimes less revenue stream clarity as the network is still being built. We aim to manage such risks by imposing key performance indicators \u2013 like minimum number of houses connected \u2013 that must be met before we consider financing. Outlook The current market environment offers opportunities to build exposure to infrastructure debt, an asset class with a vital contribution to global societies and economies. As the world recovers from Covid-19 and governments and companies pursue sustainable growth paths, we expect a pick-up in merger and acquisition activity, typically financed by debt. At the same time banks, traditionally one of the largest infrastructure debt financiers, are continuing to retrench from long-term funding markets because of regulatory hurdles. That opens the door for other institutional investors. While there will be challenges, such as rising interest rates, the sector can serve as a long-term sustainable asset through which investors can help fund the infrastructure to keep economies moving.

Investors worry about how to preserve their wealth and generate real returns in this inflationary environment. One proven option is the exploitation of momentum investing across asset classes. Key takeaways We have recently begun experiencing inflation pressures not seen for 40 years. Unsurprisingly, in the past couple of months real assets such as commodities have done well, but so have Cross-Asset Momentum-type strategies. On the other hand, equities \u2013 and not just bonds \u2013 produced some losses. Our long-term analysis, going back to 1964, shows that the above matches with what has happened in past episodes of high inflation. Our interpretation of why momentum is doing well is that high inflation is in fact akin to momentum in consumer prices. This consumer price momentum leads to persistent reactions in the economy, central bank actions and private investment decisions, that in turn drive market-price trends. Load More "

But the challenges have also accelerated innovation \u2013 from businesses investing in artificial intelligence to streamline trade to diversifying suppliers to ensure continued flows of goods. The disruption is creating significant opportunities for investment to help future-proof supply chains against further upheavals. Key takeaways Supply chains have been strained by the Covid-19 pandemic as suppliers struggle to keep up with surging demand The Russian military\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated existing supply chain disruption, pushing up energy and key material prices further Upheaval to trade may impact corporate earnings, but companies are mitigating risks by shaking up their supply chains and investing in technology Amid the disruption, investors can find opportunities in sectors such as data centres, automation, and agricultural technology From rising petrol prices to delays in securing semiconductor chips, consumers and businesses have felt the impact of disrupted supply chains. The causes \u2013 from the multi-year continuing deglobalisation in some sectors to Covid-19 and, most recently, the Russia-Ukraine situation \u2013 are pushing up inflation and creating challenges for markets already grappling with shifting inflation expectations (see Exhibit 1). But it is also triggering profound changes in the world of commerce and how goods and services are traded, while creating exciting openings for investors. Why have supply chains been hit? Covid-19 caused significant disruption to supply chains as sudden changes in consumer spending \u2013 an initial drop and then a surge in demand, in part fuelled by government financial support \u2013 left retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers reeling at a time when ports, factories and other businesses were hampered by lockdowns of economies. With long lead times a supply chain feature, suppliers of sought-after goods struggled to keep pace with demand, pushing delivery times out and prices up1. Other one-off events have further hampered trade \u2013 and 2021 had an abundance of them \u2013 spanning severe floods in Europe, a winter storm in Texas and a six-day blockage of the Suez Canal, a major shipping artery. In a sign of the bottlenecks straining supply chains, transpacific shipments took an average of 80 days in December 2021, 37 days longer than in December 2019.2 Even before the pandemic, supply chains were feeling the strain from signs of creeping protectionism and a more self-sufficient approach \u2013 consider the US-China trade dispute and Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. Trans-Pacific shipments December, 2019: 43 days December, 2021: 80 days3 For a quick-read overview of the issues affecting supply chains and the investment implications, see our supply chain snapshot: www.allianzgi.com/supplychainsnapshot Exhibit 1: Global Supply Chain Pressure Index Note: Based on global transportation costs measured using data on sea shipping costs, using data from the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) and the Harpex index, as well as BLS airfreight cost indices for freight flights bet Source: Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Russia-Ukraine uncertainty The invasion of Ukraine has emerged as the latest obstacle to global trade. Since Russia is the world\u2019s second largest oil exporter and largest gas exporter, the course of the crisis has consequences for two of the major commodities driving the global economy. Oil prices surged, hitting USD 130 per barrel, their highest level in 14 years, in March 2022. That has a direct knock-on effect on trade \u2013 consider the reported 80% rise in China to Europe air freight costs in late February.4 The conflict has sent shockwaves through other supply chains too as Russia is a big producer of materials such as palladium and nickel, while both Russia and Ukraine produce everything from wheat to barley, corn, and fertiliser. How is the disruption triggering changes in global supply chains? In response to the supply chain stresses, some companies are seeking to build more resilience into their operations against the risk of further upheavals. In many cases, the push to give their supply chains more flexibility and strength is an acceleration of changes they were already making before the shake-up of the last two years: Building inventory: The pandemic left an indelible mark on global supply chains as some companies found themselves without inventory due to lockdowns or staff sickness. For example, at least one major car manufacturer temporarily suspended manufacturing operations in early 2020 after the pandemic disrupted the flow of parts.5 Events have encouraged some firms to consider overhauling just-in-time models that have formed the backbone of supply chain management for decades in favour of just-in-case, which requires holding greater inventory. Several car manufacturers are reported to be stockpiling chips, batteries, and other key components to ensure future deliveries. Some leading retailers have increased their use of \u201cpack and hold inventory,\u201d involving buying larger quantities of certain items and holding it in preparation for periods of high demand and tight supply. And other companies are making similar moves. A late 2020 survey of supply chain professionals by Gartner found 43% are investing now in increasing inventory, with a further 11% planning to do so within the next two years.6 Nearshoring and reshoring: Surging transport costs and delays in accessing materials have encouraged more firms to consider nearshoring, the process of transferring manufacturing or supplier business to a nearby country closer to the location of demand for its manufactured products. Some European fashion brands plan to move more manufacturing from Asia closer to European markets in response to rising shipping costs.7 In Asia, an important manufacturing and supply base, companies are diversifying their supply chains within the continent to build contingency in case of disruption. This trend has been hastened in recent years by the US-China trade dispute, a row that pushed up tariffs. A \u201cChina+1\u201d supply chain strategy has seen other Asian countries including Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and India benefit. Covid-19 has given China+1 renewed focus. Recent research from Australian logistics firm Toll Group found that of the more than one quarter of businesses it surveyed that have either already or are planning to move some of their work outside China within the next three years, 32% are considering Vietnam and 30% India.8 In some cases, governments are seeking to reduce their countries\u2019 reliance on key components sourced from overseas. The United States, European Union and others have all announced plans to develop their own chipmaking industries. Eventually, that may help ease a global chip shortage stoked by surging demand for cars and other products that include chips, as well as pandemic-linked production problems. One possible longer-term consequence of the recent heightened geopolitical tensions could be a polarisation of the two preeminent global ecosystems centred around the US and China. That could hasten supply chain reorganisations and even lead to reshoring, where businesses move manufacturing back home. Investing in technology: One of the challenges highlighted by the recent instability was that very few firms had an overview of their supply chains at every stage. Remote working too brought its own challenges. According to a 2021 McKinsey & Company survey, only 2% of supply chain leaders had visibility into their supply base beyond the second tier, the term for those companies contracted via a vendor.9 Here advanced analytics can help companies plan and navigate risks. The use of data to simulate events or provide deeper insights is being harnessed by increasing numbers of firms. According to the same McKinsey survey, companies that reported successfully managing the pandemic were 2.5 times more likely to report they had pre-existing advanced-analytics capabilities. Robotics is the other new technology transforming supply chains. In recent years, firms began turning to robots as a way to offset higher labour costs. But their role became more integral still during the pandemic as companies grappled with labour shortages. Cheaper and more competent than ever, robots can streamline the speed and efficiency of routine tasks such as inventory checks and fulfilment practices, while allowing human workers to focus on more value-added tasks. What does the disruption mean for investors? While the disruption may squeeze company profit margins, particularly in those sectors most vulnerable to supply shortages such as industrials, it is also driving wide-scale innovation. This creates opportunities for investors. Here are four investment ideas in a world of dislocated supply chains: Data centres: as global commerce has been roiled by dislocations, more businesses have sought to better manage the complexity of their supply chains. That has helped spur demand for data centres and the technology that power them to handle the increasing shift to digital transactions and operations. The online shopping and working from home revolution, accelerated by the pandemic, added to positive tailwinds data centres were already experiencing from the needs of cloud storage, more devices being connected to the internet, e-commerce and streaming services. Combined these factors helped to push up investment in the sector by 60% in 2021, according to JLL. Investors can also seek out opportunities from the manufacturers of the equipment within the data centres and the providers of the services linked to them. In the case of the UK, the world\u2019s second-largest data centre market, Brexit is providing an additional accelerator as a move to UK specific data legislation leads more companies to open or grow data centre facilities. Government regulations are helping stoke demand in other countries too. China, Turkey, Australia, France and Germany have data localisation requirements, which \u2013 to different degrees \u2013 require that certain data of individuals in those countries be held locally.10 Investor takeaway: Data centres offer diversification and exposure to assets with long-term growth drivers. Agricultural technology: the Russian government\u2019s recent ban on exports of over 200 products included key soft commodities such as wheat, sugar and agricultural equipment. Russia and Ukraine\u2019s position as top producers of sunflower oil is creating more disruption across food markets. Food security fears have been further fanned by a decline in crop planting by farmers in Ukraine, a key exporter of soft commodities like wheat and barley. Against a backdrop of food prices already reaching record highs in February 2022, we think this could lead to higher farm income in the US and Latin America as alternative markets are sought out, opening the way for more investment in agricultural technology and water irrigation equipment. The sector\u2019s long-term growth outlook has strengthened in recent years as more countries seek to build resilience into food supply chains to reduce the impact of increasingly regular natural events such as drought and floods brought on by climate change. The Covid-19 pandemic added an additional tailwind as agricultural commodity prices surged due to supply shortages. Investment in farm tech venture capital, spanning everything from the use of robots to GPS technology, surged to USD 7.9 billion in 2020, up 41% from the previous year.11 That spending is likely to ramp up further as modern farm technology brings down usage of water, fertiliser and pesticides. Investor takeaway: the Ukraine-Russia situation is likely to sharpen a focus on food security, adding a further tailwind to a sector viewed as an integral long-term part of building resilience into global food supply chains in the face of climate change. Investment in farm tech venture capital Increased to USD 7.9 billion in 2020 from USD 5.6 billion in 2019 up 41% from 201912 Renewable energy: soaring hydrocarbon prices in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine crisis provide a stark reminder of the global economy\u2019s vulnerability to volatile energy markets. Sanctions, including the United States and UK\u2019s ban on Russian oil and gas imports and Germany\u2019s intention to end Russian oil imports by the end of 2022, add further uncertainty to future global fossil fuel supplies. The disruption is set to accelerate investment in renewable energy, particularly in Europe, which relies on Russia for 45% of its natural gas imports and around a third of its oil imports, as countries seek greater energy independence.13 As its produced locally, renewable energy represents one of the most effective strategies for reducing reliance on international energy providers. Europe has long been committed to the energy transition. The European Commission adopted a set of proposals to make the EU\u2019s climate, energy, transport and taxation policies fit for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. We believe the crisis will add meaningful fiscal and political support to alternative forms of energy as decision makers aim to move long-term timelines forward, improve regulatory support and increase spending. Investor takeaway: political and financial focus on renewable energy is set to intensify in the wake of the Ukraine situation, a push likely to require significant funding from private investors. Robotics: from managing greater inventory build-up to helping pack shipments more efficiently, robots are increasingly being seen as a solution by many companies to the greater complexity rippling through supply chains. In a world of deglobalisation in some sectors where companies face higher costs from rising wages and overall higher inflation, as well as supply shocks, investment in automation and robotics will be increasingly seen as a way to mitigate risks to fragile supply chains. So, what is the potential for greater investment in robotics long-term? Currently, there are 126 industrial robots per 10,000 manufacturing jobs globally, implying a robot density of about 1%. High single-digit robot density in manufacturing hubs like South Korea and Singapore shows the potential for future growth in markets such as China, the US and France, where density is much lower (see Exhibit 2).14 Investor takeaway: businesses across supply chains will turn to robots as they rethink how they move goods to customers and to future-proof their operations against supply and cost risks. Exhibit 2: Robot density in the manufacturing industry Note: Robot density nearly doubled globally - International Federation of Robotics (ifr.org) Source: World Robotics 2021 What is the outlook for supply chains? Before the Ukraine invasion we had been predicting a supply chain recovery in the second half of 2022 as production growth recovered. But the crisis is a fresh headwind to the global economy, adding downside risks to a gradual recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Much depends on how the invasion pans out, but also the course of sanctions imposed by the West against Russia. In addition to surging commodity prices, the crisis has prompted disruption right across the corporate world \u2013 from freight suppliers cancelling shipments to the country to oil majors seeking to sell business units and some companies pulling out of Russia altogether. In a move that will further complicate commerce, some Russian banks are also being frozen out of the global financial system. And Covid-19 challenges persist. The latest lockdowns in major parts of China are raising fresh obstacles to global trade. The continuing long-term deglobalisation in some sectors will also present challenges. For example, China\u2019s dual circulation policy, a push to boost consumer spending at home while continuing to promote manufacturing prowess internationally, will help shape the role of the world\u2019s second-largest trader of goods in the global economy and the development of supply chains for years to come. Download the pdf version 1 Challenges have been magnified by a phenomenon known as the \u201cbullwhip effect\u201d as swings in consumer demand were amplified up the supply chain from the retailer through to the wholesaler and manufacturer due to a variance of orders. This can create a supply-demand mismatch. 2 Source: Freight Waves: Imports take \"dramatically longer\" to reach US as bottlenecks bite, January 2022 3 Source: Freight Waves: Imports take \"dramatically longer\" to reach US as bottlenecks bite, January 2022 4 Source: CNBC: How the Russia-Ukraine war is worsening shipping snarls and pushing up freight rates, March 2022 5 Source: Reuters: Hyundai to halt South Korea output as China virus disrupts parts supply, February 2022 6 Source: Gartner Research: Supply Chain Executive Report: Future of Supply Chain \u2014 Crisis Shapes the Profession 7 Source: Reuters: How global supply chains are falling out of fashion, September 2021 8 Source: Toll Group: https://www.tollgroup.com/future-logistics/how-covid-19-has-accelerated-china-plus-one 9 Source: McKinsey & Company: How COVID-19 is reshaping supply chains, November 2021 10 Source: United States International Trade Commission: Data Centers Around the World: A Quick Look, May 2021 11 Source: AgFunder: 2021 Farm Tech Investment Report 12 Source: AgFunder: 2021 Farm Tech Investment Report 13 Source: International Energy Agency: Frequently Asked Questions on Energy Security, March 2022 14 Source: International Federation of Robotics: Robot density nearly doubled globally , December 2021 Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against losses.

        "content": " Reality strikes by Gregor Hirt | 10/05/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary In the face of a mix of pressures, markets are demonstrating that they can no longer defy gravity. Amid intensifying inflation pressures, investors are starting to challenge valuations and earning expectations \u2013 and they should alter their positioning accordingly. Key takeaways US equity markets are the latest to bear the brunt of concerns around intense inflation pressures and continuing geopolitical uncertainty Against this backdrop, investors increasingly challenge elevated valuations and earnings expectations, particularly as input prices rise The negative sentiment is set to roll over even more from bonds into equities, and we have altered our positioning accordingly While continuing to favour commodity investments, we also see potential in the UK equity market thanks to its exposure to energy and healthcare, and its defensive bias What has happened? Equity markets have started the week on a gloomy note. Until now, European stockmarkets have seen the biggest impact of the invasion of Ukraine. On Monday, it was the turn of US equity indices to play catch up, as the S&P 500 slid more than 3% during the day\u2019s trading. It seems the markets realise that the US Federal Reserve\u2019s famous \u201cput\u201d \u2013 its historical pledge to step in to support asset markets when needed \u2013 is definitively now history, or at least has a lower \u201cstrike price\u201d than previously. The central bank is using multiple channels to cool the broiling inflation pressures, and this will come at the cost of financial assets if necessary. Indeed, with real yields now in positive territory, the attractiveness of stocks \u2013 both on an absolute and relative basis \u2013 is starting to be challenged. As for government bonds, it seems that risk-off is starting to trump inflation fears \u2013 at least in investors\u2019 minds. While US government bonds have been seriously under pressure in recent months, the situation seems to have stabilised \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 in recent days (see Exhibit 1). Exhibit 1: US government bonds are the most oversold in at least 50 years Source: Bloomberg. Data as at 9 May, 2022. Alongside the Fed\u2019s decisive action to curb inflation, which will likely hit the economy over time, international factors could also lead to a weaker global economy. Our assumption that Omicron would be hard to control in China is unfortunately materialising. Outbreaks are leading to further shutdowns of cities and productive activity in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. This could lead to another round of international supply shocks, negatively impacting a global economy already disrupted by the attack on Ukraine. Against this backdrop of inflation stresses and geopolitical uncertainty, investors have finally started to question valuations and earning expectations that have remained relatively lofty. In particular, they are challenging still optimistic assumptions concerning the solidity of margins in an environment of rising input prices, whether these are wages or energy prices. This reassessment of the economic situation also starts to spill over into credit spreads, which have crept up in the past few weeks. While not dramatic, this trend will further stress companies\u2019 margins by increasing refinancing costs. All in all, we are entering a difficult period where still worrying inflation rates will require central banks to reduce overall liquidity, while higher yields, input prices and supply shocks affect companies\u2019 margins. The good news is that investor positioning is moving back to more attractive levels, while valuations have started to come down from what were too rich levels. What this means for investors In recent months, our Multi Asset view has been cautious on both fixed income and equity markets while favouring commodity markets. We continue to be positive on energy prices \u2013 a view supported by systemic under-investments in the sector. From a tactical perspective, we expect the market negativity to roll over from bonds into equities in an even bigger way. We remain essentially cautious on bonds, amid worries that interest rates will trend higher over the long term. But we think much of these concerns are priced in in the short term. Therefore we have tactically reduced our underweights in US treasuries and UK gilts \u2013 shifting to a neutral stance \u2013 while remaining underweight on eurozone bonds and strong underweight on eurozone-periphery bonds. We are adding to our negative view on equities. Having been very cautious on eurozone and emerging-market equities for some time, we have also moved US equities into negative territory in the past week. The only equity market where we still see some potential is the UK, which benefits from its exposure to energy and healthcare, and its defensive bias. On emerging-market debt hard currency, our view is negative overall. This hides a split assessment due to the heterogeneity of the index: energy producers like Qatar, Saudi Arabia and even Mexico could prove resilient, while energy importers will increasingly feel the brunt of a stronger US dollar, rising energy prices and slowing global activity. Considering the potential for political disruptions due to higher agricultural prices, we would recommend only investments in actively managed solutions, not index-based ones. Be ready for long-term opportunities amid the selloffs Finally, we can only repeat our preference for adding alternative beta-type strategies that may profit from this type of environment. While commodity investments are an obvious choice to protect against rising inflation, commodity trading advisors (CTAs) are having an excellent run year-to-date as they can also short markets. We also see value in volatility investments in the kind of rapidly moving markets that we are currently experiencing. Finally, it may be wise to keep some cash on the sidelines as larger selloffs can open opportunities for longer-term investments at attractive levels. Investing involves risk.

Key takeaways Earth Day 2022 reminds us of the startling statistic that only 20% of waste created by humans is recycled.

These challenges also create significant investment opportunities: the European Commission\u2019s Circular Economy Action Plan could increase EU GDP by an additional 0.5% by 2030 and create approximately 700,000 new jobs. The first Earth Day rally in 1970 encouraged environmental protection for the planet but the message requires greater urgency for Earth Day 2022 as earlier this year it was announced that the world has already \u201cexceeded the safe planetary boundary for pollutants1.\u201d Of the millions of tons of waste humans produce annually, less than 20% is being recycled and the volume is growing, yet a sustainable planet requires sustainable growth2. An emerging solution is the transition towards a circular economy which supports global targets for climate neutrality and halting biodiversity loss, while presenting a growing opportunity for long-term investors. The good news is that companies are increasingly considering the long-term implications of not addressing the risks that threaten our planet, while at the same time understanding where new opportunities exist for sustainable growth. Participating in the circular economy is becoming a necessary move for companies of all sizes in solving the threat that waste pollution poses to our environment. It is a shift that has become possible through alignment of business objectives and environmental targets. From linear to circular Many resources are finite. Global population growth of 25% by 2050 and a rising middle class with changing consumption patterns threaten to exacerbate this problem of scarcity.3 Rethinking how we obtain, use, reuse and optimise the world\u2019s resources remains crucial for the future stability of businesses in sectors as diverse as food production, construction and electronics. Progress requires disruption of the traditional linear pattern of consumption known as \u201cmake \u2013 take \u2013 waste\u201d and a move towards a circular process involving the reduction of excessive waste, emphasis on reuse, remanufacturing and repair, and recycling of the materials we use every day. The circular economy is based on three major principles which should be driven by design: elimination of waste and pollution, circulation of products and materials, and regeneration of the current ecosystem. Enablers of the circular economy transition include urbanisation, digitisation, consumer demand and consumers\u2019 awareness of social and environmental issues. Furthermore, regulation has started to play a role. In 2020, the European Commission (EC) recognised the importance of this evolution to new production and consumption models through adoption of the Circular Economy Action Plan, which became a key pillar of the European Green Deal. Moreover, contributing to several of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including SDG 12 \u2013 responsible consumption and production \u2013 the circular economy is considered the second most important technology innovation space for the SDGs after Big Data4. Innovative entrepreneurs and large corporations are developing new ideas for the circular economy, such as the use of renewable resources or taking advantage of the value of waste. Going beyond the limitations of recycling, new technologies and design solutions will play a key role in enabling future products to be fit for a circular economy. Waste not, want not Improved waste management is critical to circular consumption. Addressing the problem of plastic packaging for example could help eliminate one of the largest sources of waste in the world. While it is cheap and effective for many purposes, only 14%5 is collected for recycling and plastic is difficult to recycle multiple times. A broad-based global move towards more sustainable packaging has begun reducing waste and increasing efficiency. For example, the provision of products without packaging in some European supermarkets requires shoppers to use their own reusable bags. Such initiatives are in line with several of the SDGs which target a cleaner planet, and are supported by mounting consumer demand, and legislators increasing commitments for environmentally sustainable packaging. To tackle the electronics industry, the World Economic Forum (WEF) began an initiative to reduce waste from electronics6 calling for better product tracking and takeback campaigns to improve global circular value chains. According to WEF estimates, electronic waste could be worth USD 57 billion annually but only 20% is currently being recycled7 . In particular, extracting copper from used electronic components could reduce CO\u2082 emissions by around 63% compared to the process of copper mining8. Essential steps in progressing towards a circular model in this sector require material efficiency, improved recycling infrastructure and scaling up the volume and quality of recycled materials. Future value creation Establishing solutions for sourcing, recycling and revitalising used products \u2013 and transforming them to create further value in these sectors and others \u2013 will become increasingly important. The potential for value creation includes boosting GDP and significant job creation. The EC\u2019s Circular Economy Action Plan has predicted that the application of circular economy principles has the potential to increase EU GDP (Gross Domestic Product) by an additional 0.5% by 2030, creating approximately 700,000 new jobs9. Of the USD 103 trillion10 of total public assets under management at the end of 2020, assets managed in investment strategies contributing towards circular economic models are relatively small at USD 2 billion11. This is, however, a six-fold increase since the start of 2020 \u2013 which underlines the potential benefits of investing in the planet. Examples of emerging technologies in the circular economy Collection and recycling metals and other materials: A company in Belgium has succeeded in collecting and recycling about 30 precious and non-ferrous metals from industrial residues, as well as using electronic scrap, batteries, automotive and industrial catalysts and more. The recycling process involves complex waste streams containing precious and other specialty metals. Furthermore, related services are available in Germany, where a company is offering a system for collecting and recycling hazardous steel dust and aluminum residues and reintroducing valuable materials back into production processes. Electric arc furnaces produce a dust classified as hazardous waste that cannot be disposed of in landfills, but which instead is collected for a fee and the valuable material such as zinc is recycled. This solution implemented by one company alone prevents around two million tons of residue from reaching landfills each year. Innovative technology solutions improve recycling capabilities: In Norway, modern recycling solutions are bringing sensor-based sorting technology to modern recycling plants. An innovative holistic resources system aims to close the loop, cut global annual CO\u2082 emissions, and reduce waste. Sensor technology allows for scanning and identification of different materials faster and more accurately than either previous solutions or manual sorting by humans. The broad range of sorting solutions addresses construction waste as well as ordinary waste collected by municipals. The result of this technology is the ability to recover various ranges of materials from different sources of waste arising from packaging, paper and household waste. Renewable and sustainable biopolymers: A US company has developed innovative solutions aimed at achieving a circular use pattern for biodegradable plastics created from the seeds of plants such as canola and soy. Instead of the plastic litter that often ends up in the sea, on beaches or waterways, plastic products are developed that are biodegradable \u2013 i.e. compostable \u2013 enabling their return to nature rather than creating pollution and waste.

World Water Day aims to raise global awareness of the more than 2 billion people who, according to UN figures, live without access to safe water, as well as the more than 4 billion people experiencing severe water stress. World Water Day supports the overall achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #6: Clean Water and Sanitation for all. This year, the focus topic is \u201cGroundwater \u2013 making the invisible visible\u201d. Natural water cycle Water on earth moves in a cycle; as a resource, it cannot be \u201cused up\u201d like fossil fuels. This makes water a very special commodity. As it is used repeatedly, we must take care that water remains available throughout the cycle. Unlike other commodities, water does not have a specific value determined by markets. It is perceived to be free, with zero opportunity cost, i.e., it can be consumed in any quantity without reducing availability for others. However, that might not be true. Water is probably the most essential commodity when it comes to human life on earth, and fresh drinking water is scarce. The amount of water that can be used sustainably is limited \u2013 and becomes more limited with heavy use and increasing pollution. Demand for drinking water is growing worldwide due to population growth, changing dietary habits and rising living standards. Groundwater is the primary source of fresh water for almost half the world\u2019s population but in many parts of the world reserves are being depleted faster than the natural cycle can replenish them. This \u201cvicious circle\u201d has a devastating impact on the environment, harming ecosystems and creating desertification. Falling groundwater levels can also lead to seawater intrusion and land subsidence. According to a UNESCO report, more than 4 billion people are living in regions that are experiencing severe water stress1 , defined as occurring when the demand for water exceeds the amount available during a certain period, or when poor quality limits its use. Significant investment in innovative solutions across the three key areas of water efficiency, water quality and water supply is essential to address global water stress and to safeguard groundwater and corresponding ecosystems. The one-trillion funding gap The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates that the necessary investment to cope with this challenge will need to exceed USD 1 trillion (a number with 12 zeros) before 2030 if we are to ensure access to basic water needs and sound sanitation solutions.2 This represents a significant increase from previous estimates of around USD 600 billion. Clean water is strongly linked to a broad range of the sustainability issues connected to the other SDGs, including healthy living conditions, social balances and decent economic growth. Mitigating water issues supports the achievement of many other goals. According to estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO), the overall global economic return on water spending is USD 2.00 for each dollar invested.3 Creating universal access to sanitation could increase this to USD 5.50 per dollar invested\u2013 improving health conditions. This creates potential market opportunities for public and private stakeholders. Contamination and leaks Groundwater is burdened by many issues: from overuse to pollution. For example, more than 80% of the world\u2019s wastewater \u2013 and more than 95% in some developing countries \u2013 is still released into the environment without treatment.4 The contamination of groundwater due to a lack of separation of freshwater and wastewater disrupts the natural cycle. Modern wastewater treatment therefore aims to remove contaminants from sewage, generating effluent that is ready for discharge to the local environment or ready for reuse, thereby preventing water pollution from raw sewage. High-end ultraviolet (UV) equipment solutions, can kill germs in drinking water and enhance quality, while simultaneously making the use of chemicals redundant and lowering the energy used in the process of cleaning water. The loss of fresh water because of issues within water infrastructure is another (unnecessary) burden on groundwater. In countries like the US or the UK, large parts of the water infrastructure date back more than 100 years. In the UK5 , 3 billion litres of drinking water does not reach end-customers every day due to leaks. This is even more dramatic in the US, where the economic loss amounts to USD 9.6 billion every year6 . Repairing this infrastructure is crucial from an ecologicalpoint of view as much as an economic one, creating attractive business opportunities for utility companies. Solutions for strained water systems Industrial companies offer smart water meters, pressure sensors and network management software, providing critical information about the health of a water distribution network. In combination with artificial intelligence software, real-time data gives network operators the information necessary to identify risks, detect the exact locations of failed pipes, and reduce the real water losses without interrupting operation of the network. Speciality engineering consulting companies leverage knowledge to create further overall benefits for society. Due to the recent drought periods in California, the demand for recycled water has increased, and is actively supported by most cities and communities. Considering prolonged periods of drought and severe water crises it is all the more important to identify and invest in companies that help to expand the performance of wastewater treatment plants with technologies like membrane bioreactors that increase a plant\u2019s water production in a cost-efficient way. Agriculture\u2019s weight on water stress The agricultural sector places a significant burden on groundwater through the often-indiscriminate use of fertilisers, and the potential pollution from chemical run-off. The globally growing agricultural industry represents the largest chunk of global water demand (more than 70%). Often, extensive farming happens in regions which are already water-stressed. In Europe, for example, the dry regions in the south of Spain are a prominent producer of fruit and vegetables for consumption in Central and Western Europe \u2013 relying heavily on groundwater. Accordingly, solutions which enable more efficient farming are powerful tools to mitigate water stress, protect groundwater sources and avoid desertification. Precision technology presents an ideal solution for providing optimal irrigation with precision application, saving water compared to traditional flooding solutions and thus increasing output while conserving resources, and reducing waste. Precision agriculture enables a more accurate application of pesticides and herbicides. The more localised application means that only the necessary amount is used, instead of a widespread distribution, ensuring that significantly fewer chemicals end up in the soil, and that groundwater is less polluted. Redirecting capital flows to sustainable water solutions With water scarcity spreading worldwide and with a rapidly increasing water use the structural imbalance between water supply and demand continues to widen. Although water spending is on the rise, and governments and corporates alike have begun to realise the need for urgent capital expenditure there is still a considerable mismatch between capital requirements and available funding. Allianz Global Investors identifies companies that actively provide solutions to water scarcity and water quality issues, and which help to improve the sustainability of water resources. By investing in those innovators, we help redirecting capital flows to sustainable water solutions.

Due to potential disruptions to Russia\u2019s significant supplies of energy-related raw materials, commodities have regained favour amongst investors, with most of the attention focused on oil and gas. Read why Global CIO Multi Asset Gregor Hirt and Senior Portfolio Manager Frederik Fischer believe investors may be overlooking another important aspect of the current commodity cycle: industrial metals. The invasion of Ukraine by Russian armed forces has shone a light on investing in commodities. Due to potential disruptions to Russia\u2019s significant supplies of energy-related raw materials, the asset class \u2013 which had previously been languishing for a protracted period in the doldrums \u2013 has regained favour among investors, with most of the attention focused on oil and gas. In fact, many experts predict crude oil prices could even top USD 200 a barrel1 in 2022 amid tight supply. While we do not consider the attention to energy to be misplaced, we believe that some investors may be overlooking another important aspect of the current commodity cycle: industrial metals such as nickel, palladium and aluminium \u2013 which are also plentiful in Russia and might face similar disruptions In addition to supply disturbances, we see two other key factors bolstering the asset class in general \u2013 and industrial metals in particular \u2013 over the long run: a) industrial metals are crucial in the manufacturing of key components of the clean- energy transition (ie, electric-vehicle batteries); and b) commodities have historically been an effective hedge against inflation in investors\u2019 portfolios, a particularly effective trait when price increases in many developed economies have hit decades-high levels. Additionally, low correlations with equities and bonds mean that commodities can also potentially smooth returns during periods of intense volatility, such as the present (see Exhibit 1). Exhibit 1: commodities have fared well when inflation is high, can smooth returns Year-over-year, percentage change Source: Bloomberg, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 31 March 2022. Supply-demand dynamics provide significant tailwind Supply-demand dynamics, both short and long term, offer a significant tailwind for commodities, in our view. In the short term, the global economy is still only in the early stages of emerging from the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, boosting demand for commodities. At the same time, the invasion of Ukraine coupled with supply-chain disruptions are hampering the supply of everything from oil to industrial metals. For many years, the supply side has been starved of capital investment in everything from oil exploration to mining (Exhibit 2) as capital discipline has prevailed in the energy and mining sectors. With new projects such as new oil rigs, shale drilling or metal mines taking years to get from initial investment to production, we see the risk of a significant increase in supply as low. New supply is also being restricted by factors that open companies up to environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks. For example, new and existing mines are producing falling ore grades. Producing metals from lower-grade ores adds technical complexity to extraction, while processing requires larger equipment and the use of more chemicals. As mining becomes potentially \u201cdirtier\u201d, protests against new mines have grown, amplified by social media. On the demand side of the equation, commodities \u2013 and industrial metals in particular \u2013 appear to have a rosy outlook, not least because demand should increase as the energy transition gathers pace. Indeed, many countries in Europe, most notably Germany, have said they want to accelerate their switch to more renewables as part of an urgent strategy to reduce their dependence on Russian gas. Significant planned spending on infrastructure backing the US renewable energy transition also buoys demand. As shown in Exhibit 3, demand is forecasted to be strong for such metals as copper and aluminium in the coming years (current inventories of both these metals are low). Exhibit 2: weak capital expenditures have restrained commodity supply Oil rig numbers slowly rising but remain low Big 4 mining capex remains tight Note: Graph on left shows Baker Hughes US Crude Oil Rig Count, a leading indicator of demand for products used in drilling, completing, producing and processing hydrocarbons. In right-hand graph, Big Four refers to the world\u2019s four largest diversified miners \u2013 Rio Tinto, BHP, Anglo American and Glencore \u2013 collectively considered a proxy for the industry more broadly.

Net-zero transition favours industrial metals At the 2021 Glasgow Climate Pact, governments globally agreed to accelerate efforts to keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050, admitting that actual progress toward earlier commitments had fallen short of promises. As governments globally redouble their efforts on renewable energy, the road to \u201cnet zero\u201d climate emissions should favour industrial metals. The shift from combustion-engine cars to electric vehicles (EVs) is copper-, nickel-, lithium- and aluminium-intense. A battery-powered EV, for example uses 75 kilograms (165 pounds) of copper vs 20 kilograms (44 pounds) in a traditional car. Solar power, wind power and battery power storage are also tailwinds for metal demand. Photovoltaic cell technology uses metals such as silver, aluminium, copper, zinc and steel, while the deep-sea cables used to bring offshore wind energy back to land require copper, aluminium and steel. The International Energy Agency estimates demand for lithium used in the batteries that power EVs could expand by a factor of 30 by 2030.2 Demand for aluminium for solar panels was roughly 2.4 million tons in 2020. It is now forecast by the industry magazine mining.com to rise to 4.6 million tons by 2040. Russia is an industrial metal powerhouse that produces nickel (used in batteries), palladium (a key component of catalytic converters), aluminium (used in such things as battery casings, wind turbine nacelles and blades, and hydrogen fuel cells \u2013 as well as for framing solar panels), platinum (used in auto catalysts), steel (used in construction and car manufacturing) and copper (used for making cables and for wiring in EVs, solar panels and wind turbines). Russia accounts for almost 14% of global mineral extraction and produces more than 10% of the world\u2019s nickel, according to Thomson Reuters. As investors consider exposure to the asset class, however, they should be mindful of potential risks associated with passive strategies. The S&P GSCI Index \u2013 the most popular benchmark among passive commodity strategies \u2013 is heavily tilted towards energy, with a modest weighting of about 10% to industrial metals. By contrast, the industrial metals weighting in the Bloomberg Commodity ex Agriculture/Livestock Index is about twice as large, leaving it better placed to benefit from the energy transition. Finally, given the ESG risks that are inherent in the industrial metals sector, an active approach can help identify and mitigate such risks. For investors without commodities in their strategic asset allocation, we believe that industrial metals may offer an opportunity to profit from the structural trend in commodities or hedge part of their inflation risk. For those who already have an allocation that may be overweighted towards energy, now is the time to consider taking an active approach with the goal of enhancing diversification \u2013 and potential returns \u2013 while investing in this asset class.

The attack has unsettled already volatile markets, made inflation worse and accelerated a deglobalisation trend that has been apparent for some time. Investors may need a new toolkit, rather than relying on traditional approaches that previously helped in turbulent times. Key takeaways Investors face an unpredictable outlook as worries about inflation and supply chains fuel market volatility; uncertainties have been intensified by economic sanctions on Russia and global monetary policy The move away from globalisation is another driver of inflation, particularly as production is repatriated to less efficient locations, inventories expand and labour costs increase In this environment, diversifying across and within asset classes may not be sufficient; it may be time to adjust existing positions and add new approaches Consider combining commodities with other real assets to improve resiliency, or harvesting risk premia to add incremental returns Other ideas: US high yield spreads look attractive; \u201cDigital Darwinism\u201d should help certain tech companies; and the road to net zero should boost sustainable investments Volatility has dominated markets this year, fuelled by Russian armed forces\u2019 invasion of Ukraine and hawkish central bank warnings about inflation risks. The resulting economic sanctions on Russia are also having global repercussions that are making the inflation problem worse. Countries are rethinking their energy and food supply chains, and they are reassessing the currencies used for essential transactions. Sanctions have also sped up the deglobalisation trend as production sites are relocated, organisations grow more vertical, and the allocation of labour and capital becomes less efficient. As the global economy struggles to cope with these massive changes, investors should use the opportunity to reassess how they structure their portfolios. What has worked in the past for many \u2013 comprehensive diversification across and within asset classes \u2013 may not be sufficient. Rather, it may be time to actively adjust existing positions and add new approaches. These may include combining commodities with other real assets to help improve resiliency, or harvesting risk premia to add incremental returns. As globalisation wanes, geofinance is becoming critical in how the world works It\u2019s no surprise that financial markets are becoming instrumental in geopolitical struggles and vice versa \u2013 a concept frequently referred to as \u201cgeofinance\u201d. Consider how economic sanctions against Russia are having knock-on effects around the world: Russia\u2019s central bank is limiting the use of its US dollar and euro reserves. This leads to the fundamental question of whether those currencies still make sense as reserve in a central bank\u2019s balance sheet \u2013 at least in countries potentially exposed to sanctions. There are few alternatives at present, but we would expect an increased diversification of currency baskets over time and larger reserves of gold \u2013 an asset class we favour in the long term. Since it is now almost impossible to trade with Russia in US dollars, the greenback could again be challenged as the preferred global trading currency. We do not expect the US dollar to be replaced by any other currency in the coming years, but over time, more transactions will take place in what will also become trading currencies. As the US has, over decades, financed its deficit with international demand for dollars, this could lead \u2013 permanently \u2013 to higher inflation in the dollar through its devaluation and, consequently, less demand for US Treasuries by central banks. And the timing couldn\u2019t be worse for the US Treasury, with the US debt-to-GDP ratio ballooning at around 133% at the end of 2021, up 25 percentage points since the onset of the Covid-19 crisis.1 Prohibitions against doing business with Russian companies \u2013 which will lead to their eventual exclusion by major equity and fixed-income indices \u2013 could over time lead to a repricing of tail risks for countries not aligned with the West. This could become particularly problematic if we see another \u201ccold war\u201d between blocs of countries; in that case, large clusters of risks will likely emerge. Perhaps we will soon have to redefine global bonds and equities based on this new reality. Get ready: inflation may be here to stay With the globalisation trend faltering, \u201cre-regionalisation\u201d gaining traction and growing barriers to entry between trading blocs, capital and labour will be misallocated \u2013 particularly as production is repatriated to less efficient locations, inventories are expanded and labour costs increase. These inflationary trends would be serious enough on their own, but there are also other major inflationary shifts underway. Consider what is happening in the energy and agricultural supply chains. The climate transition is contributing to an inflationary commodities super-cycle When we look at the global economy, we see signs of a \u201csuper-cycle\u201d in commodities \u2013 a massive shift in production and usage that is supported by global efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Consider that fossil-fuel investment (especially in shale gas and coal) has plunged over the last few years, while the transition to \u201cgreen\u201d energy has just begun in earnest. Green technology is dependent on a different set of commodities \u2013 just think about the copper used in electric vehicles. In addition, we must recognise that while renewable energy is less polluting, it is less \u201cenergy-dense\u201d than its fossil-fuel or nuclear counterparts on a same-for-same basis. That means more energy sources will be needed to produce the same amount of energy. Before the invasion of Ukraine, we were convinced that the energy transition alone would lead to some inflationary pressures. Since then, the conflict has been a catalyst for major changes that could push inflation up even more. Consider these examples: Germany is rethinking its long-term dependence on Russian gas. The EU is discussing a EUR 200 billion package of \u201cNextGenerationEU\u201d green bonds, favouring (among other areas) renewables and green energy. France and other countries are subsidising petrol prices, which indirectly supports demand etc. Above all, a full boycott of Russian gas imports \u2013 which we believe is increasingly likely \u2013 would worsen the inflationary gas price shock. Shifts in the agricultural system are inflationary In parallel, the drop in production of agricultural goods \u2013 especially Ukrainian wheat \u2013 has already led to rising food prices, and more increases are in store. This will be untenable for already exposed countries like Egypt, Nigeria or even Turkey, and we could even see a growing risk of civil unrest in certain parts of the world. Of course, those production cuts will be at least partly compensated for by production rises or substitutions elsewhere. But in the EU and other regions close to Russia, the fertilisers that help increase productivity are mainly produced thanks to Russian gas. A less-productive agricultural system therefore likely means higher food prices in the medium term \u2013 and related commodity prices have already risen significantly (see Exhibit 1). Exhibit 1: in recent months, the price of gas, wheat and potash (used in fertiliser) has jumped Price of Chicago wheat, European natural gas and Brazil potash (2015-2022) Source: Bloomberg. Data as at 12 April 2022. So the world is facing the real risk that there will be a further rise not only in inflation, but in inflation expectations. Similar environments in the past have led to a vicious inflationary cycle \u2013 something central banks want to avoid at all costs. It is therefore not surprising that the US Federal Reserve threatens to use the \u201cbig bazooka\u201d \u2013 50-basis-point hikes \u2013 to cool down the US economy. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank has clearly stated, despite the risk of an economic slowdown, that it would use a more hawkish approach, emphasising the focus on maintaining its credibility in the fight against inflation. What should investors do? Consider using the next bond-market correction to buy back positions We think interest rates could rise even further than expected in the next month, especially in Europe. Meanwhile, we expect the US bond market to bounce back over the next 12 months, after many years of overvaluation (see Exhibit 2). This offers some perspective. While our Multi Asset expert group has moved from a strong overweight to an overall underweight in fixed income this year, we would certainly capture the next bond correction to start building back some positions. Exhibit 2: powered by rising inflation, the recent jump in short-term Treasuries was among the highest in decades Six-month change in 2-year US Treasury rates (1985-2022) Source:Bloomberg. Data as at March 2022. Keep a close eye on equity markets The reaction of equity markets remains puzzling to us. Many ingredients are on hand for lower markets and yet retail investors don\u2019t yet seem to have the same view: Valuations remain high. Rising wages and energy costs are eating slowly but surely into companies\u2019 margins. There is tremendous uncertainty about production chains. The consumption pattern is a drag on growth. Central banks\u2019 hawkishness is set to reduce \u201cfree cash\u201d. Could it be that investors are still pursuing a \u201cbuy-the-dip\u201d strategy, which indeed worked well in past years? Or are we seeing primarily a reallocation from bonds to equities, as the latter offers a better inflation hedge, being a real asset? From our Multi Asset perspective, volatility looks set to remain high, so before we move back to a positive stance, real rates will need to come down and valuations will need to adjust. Critically, we see early signs of earnings pressure. The Allianz Global Investors Systematic Strategies team uses artificial intelligence-powered software to analyse the wording in broker reports on companies around the world, and they have seen a notable downward trend in sentiment (see Exhibit 3). Exhibit 3: broker research reports have grown increasingly negative about companies globally AllianzGI's proprietary broker sentiment score by region (Jan-Apr 2022) Source: Allianz Global Investors. Data at of April 2022. The euro zone is the primary region we\u2019re concerned about In terms of regions, we are especially worried about the euro zone. In its benchmark index (the Euro Stoxx 50), there are no large technology companies that have the same pricing power as their US counterparts do. Moreover, Europe has fewer \u201coligopolistic\u201d companies and a high dependency on energy. The UK offers much better protection thanks to its exposure to a barbell of defensive healthcare and energy. Emerging markets, on the other hand, are more complex: commodity importers will continue to suffer, especially if the US dollar remains solid, while exporters will obviously profit. China has elections approaching, so we expect to see more fiscal and monetary support for its economy, in addition to more conciliatory tones towards trade with the US and a more moderate approach to regulation. However, China\u2019s \u201czero-Covid\u201d strategy could be severely tested by the new Omicron variant, turning it into a Damocles sword hanging over China\u2019s recovery prospects. Commodities can be helpful additions to portfolios If equities as an asset class can be classified as \u201ccautiously negative\u201d and bonds may still not yet be an opportunity, what do we have left? Commodities, via direct or indirect investment, represent a great diversifier. The commodities super-cycle, the lack of supply and their overall ability to be an inflation hedge favour commodities as an asset class. The only real downside we see for now is that liquidity risks could provoke more volatility when key players \u2013 asset managers and intermediaries - exit the market. Combining commodities with other real assets (such as real estate, inflation-linked bonds, etc) may be able to help make portfolios more resilient while still allowing for exposure to equity markets. Consider strategies that harvest risk premia or target modest absolute returns This is an attractive environment for investors looking to take advantage of volatility premia. The spikes will continue to offer attractive entry points to profit from the spread implied over realised volatility, a strategy that has been successful in the long term. But such a strategy needs to be actively managed. A strategy that targets risk premia or seeks to moderate absolute return may suddenly start attracting investors\u2019 attention, despite having so much difficulty during the booming years of equity and bonds. After all, in Europe at least, cash rates are still deeply in negative territory. In that environment, a steady 2%-3% nominal yield suddenly looks perfectly acceptable as a portfolio stabiliser. Three specific opportunities At current spreads, US high yield start looking attractive especially if one does not expect a major recession in 2023. The concept of \u201cDigital Darwinism\u201d \u2013 amid a new \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d digital era \u2013 seems set to accelerate, putting certain tech and big data companies in high demand. The road to \u201cnet-zero\u201d carbon emissions will continue to attract flows into sustainable investments in both liquid and private markets. This is especially true as European regulators enact MiFID II \u2013 a massive set of new financial regulations that seem likely to be copied by global regulators in one version or another. As the West reassesses its relationship with Russia, inflationary pressures mount and central banks try to engineer a soft landing, investors will want to stay open to new ideas. Traditional diversification can be helpful during normal times, but the global economy has entered uncharted new territory. Investors will want to be flexible, nimble and active in the coming months. 1 Source: IMF. Data as at December 2021. Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against losses.

        "content": " Don\u2019t downsize your dreams Is it time to revisit the UK as an asset class? by Virginie Maisonneuve , Simon Gergel , Matthew Tillett, CFA | 21/03/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary UK equities have grown increasingly unloved over the past decade. Could that be about to change? A recent uptick in performance reminded investors what they are missing, and the market could offer growth and value opportunities. Key takeaways UK equities have fallen out of favour with investors, but a recent improvement in performance underscores the long-term investment case and could prompt inflows to return Many UK stocks appear undervalued, with companies trading at significant discounts to their equivalents overseas The UK\u2019s culture of strong governance provides a transparent environment where factors that may cause a company to underperform are more likely to be addressed and rectified Over recent years, active managers of UK equity-focused strategies have proven more likely to outperform the benchmark than their peers in global equity markets, demonstrating the opportunities that the UK may offer Is the \u201cMade in the UK\u201d label about to regain its lustre? The popularity of UK equities has declined in recent years \u2013 a trend that was established before the Brexit vote and accelerated after the UK\u2019s separation from the European Union. Globally, many pension and sovereign wealth funds have reduced their exposure to the UK, in some cases to zero. But recent months have seen performance improve and investors who shunned the UK equity markets may have been caught out. While the recent political turbulence in the UK has made headlines around the world, it could be worth looking beyond the noise and taking a fresh look at the opportunities of this neglected market. Access to global businesses \u2013 at a discount UK equities represent a sizeable market, accounting for around 4% of the MSCI All Countries World Index by volume.1 That measure makes it the largest market in Europe, roughly equivalent in size to China\u2019s equity markets. Valuations across the UK market currently appear cheap compared with the rest of the world, in particular Europe and the US. The difference between average valuations of UK and European stocks has grown since the 2016 referendum and has continued to widen, even as the dual threats of Brexit and Covid-19 have receded. As Exhibit 1 shows, the UK\u2019s value discount against Europe stood at a 40-year low at the end of 2021. The gap has narrowed slightly so far in 2022, but the UK still looks attractive. Exhibit 1: UK vs Europe average valuation premium Source: Morgan Stanley as at 2 March 2022 (includes sources from MSCI, IBES). Average valuation premium between MSCI UK and MSCI Europe ex-UK indices, based on price/earnings, price-to-book value and price/dividends ratios. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results Many of the companies in the FTSE 100 \u2013 an index of the UK\u2019s largest 100 listed companies by market capitalisation \u2013 conduct most of their business outside the UK. Around 70% of revenue from FTSE 100 firms comes from overseas trade, compared with 29% for S&P 500 companies in the US.2 This means that the fortunes of UK large caps do not necessarily reflect the UK economy. A key advantage resulting from the lack of correlation is that investors can access what are, in effect, global businesses, but at the significant discount that comes with the low valuations currently seen in the UK. Growth opportunities \u2013 and dividends too As well as the giants of the FTSE 100 index, smaller firms in the UK are also currently trading at similarly low valuations \u2013 and can offer growth opportunities as well. UK small- and mid-cap businesses are more likely to be domestically focused. As a result, they are more likely to have their fortunes tied to the UK economy, which is forecast to grow quicker than most of the developed world this year, coming out of the pandemic. There is potentially some pent-up demand still to be satisfied, due to the cumulative effects of several years of Brexit uncertainty on investment and consumption, as well as the disruption during the pandemic. Many of the most promising small- and mid-cap companies come from innovative tech-based sectors. The UK is home to a burgeoning fintech industry, and the government has invested heavily in preserving the country\u2019s status as the centre of biotech in Europe. As such, the small and mid-cap sectors are home to some high-growth businesses. What\u2019s more, the potential growth companies in these sectors also often offer value, typically being priced cheaper than equivalents in the US. UK equities are also typically more likely than stocks in other regions to provide regular dividend payments. As Exhibit 2 shows, the majority of FTSE 100 companies have continued to provide a steady and reliable stream of dividend payments each year. Even in 2020, in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, three-quarters of firms paid a dividend to investors. In today\u2019s persistent low-yield environment, dividends can prove a useful source of income. More opportunities for active investors The UK market is sizeable and diverse. Across the growth and value companies available, history shows that UK equities can offer particularly rich pickings for active stockpickers. S&P Dow Jones data suggest that almost 60% of active managers running strategies in the S&P UK BMI index outperformed the benchmark over the five years to June 2021. For context, the equivalent figures for active managers in the S&P Global 1200 index (covering global equities) stood at 12%.3 Exhibit 2: Number of FTSE companies which paid dividends in the years 2001 \u2013 2021 Source: Datastream, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 3 December 2021. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. Strong governance gets our vote The UK has a global reputation for its high standards of corporate governance. Our proxy voting figures are one indicator of this: as Exhibit 3 shows, AllianzGI voted against only around 4% of company proposals in the UK during 2021, compared with around 10-20% of proposals in EU member states \u2014 peaking at 32% in Italy \u2013 and 40% in the US. This tends to show that UK companies generally uphold the highest governance standards and require less intervention on the part of investors. This strong record of corporate governance contributes to a relatively open and transparent market \u2013 corporate boards are more likely to address any factors contributing to failings or underperformance. Exhibit 3: Allianz Global Investors\u2019 total percentage votes against all proposals by location in 2021 Source: Allianz Global Investors Divergence after Brexit? There is speculation that the UK will take advantage of Brexit to diverge in terms of its regulatory standards. As an EU member, the UK was a leader in defining the continent\u2019s governance framework so \u2013 whatever happens \u2013 we expect it to maintain the same high standards of governance. But the UK may choose to flex its regulatory regime. Any evolution would likely deliver a framework tailored to the UK\u2019s needs, which may enhance its capital markets. UK \u201cindependence\u201d could bear fruit Following Brexit, investors are starting to see the UK as a separate asset class to Europe. The distinction between the UK and continental Europe will be further strengthened if the UK can secure more trade deals with the rest of the world. The potential to negotiate deals on its own terms was heralded as a key advantage of leaving the European Union. Progress has been slow, but the potential for these deals remains and they could provide a further boost to UK-based firms. What\u2019s ahead? Recent UK news flow has been dominated by speculation about the future of Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government. Overall, however, the country represents a low level of political risk. Even the opposition parties are centrist in their approach and would likely continue a non-interventionist policy towards the stockmarket if they came to power. In summary, the UK offers a broad, diverse equity market, with cheap valuations available to active investors. With promising growth companies and undervalued large caps, it adds up to a strong long-term case for investment. UK equities may have fallen out of favour with many investors over the past decade or so, but recent performance will not have escaped notice, and we expect investment in the UK to return.

The attack has unsettled already volatile markets, made inflation worse and accelerated a deglobalisation trend that has been apparent for some time. Investors may need a new toolkit, rather than relying on traditional approaches that previously helped in turbulent times. Key takeaways Investors face an unpredictable outlook as worries about inflation and supply chains fuel market volatility; uncertainties have been intensified by economic sanctions on Russia and global monetary policy The move away from globalisation is another driver of inflation, particularly as production is repatriated to less efficient locations, inventories expand and labour costs increase In this environment, diversifying across and within asset classes may not be sufficient; it may be time to adjust existing positions and add new approaches Consider combining commodities with other real assets to improve resiliency, or harvesting risk premia to add incremental returns Other ideas: US high yield spreads look attractive; \u201cDigital Darwinism\u201d should help certain tech companies; and the road to net zero should boost sustainable investments Load More "

        "content": " Embracing Disruption How do recent events in Europe affect the opportunities in transitional energy? by Julien Girault | 17/03/2022 Summary The invasion of Ukraine by Russian armed forces has destabilised security in Europe, creating a humanitarian crisis and market turmoil. With half of Europe\u2019s oil and 30% to 40% of its gas imported from Russia, the invasion has escalated concerns over what Europe\u2019s existing and long-term energy mix will look like in providing the region with dependable, affordable and climate-friendly access to energy. Here, we look at some considerations for investors assessing the energy market. Key takeaways The implications of the current crisis extend beyond fossil fuels into renewable energy and climate solutions Europe needs to remedy the significant underinvestment in energy infrastructure to counter a risk of sustained energy poverty The decline in fossil fuel use is likely to be slower, so opportunities exist in carbon capture and energy storage solutions, energy efficiency technologies and local sourcing of strategic metals and minerals In recent decades, Europe has grown highly dependent on Russian oil and natural gas, and the invasion of Ukraine by Russian armed forces has put Europe in a difficult position. The price of energy has soared even as Europe feels growing pressure to increase economic sanctions against Russia. This has reignited a discussion about Europe\u2019s energy mix, the impact of rising costs and how to make a faster transition to clean energy. The energy mix: Europe has been grappling with a sustained, widening gap between its investment in energy infrastructure and its dependence on energy \u2013 a trend that is replicated globally (see Exhibits 1 and 2). Since 1990, Europe\u2019s total energy supply has contracted overall. And while its dependence on coal, oil and natural gas has fallen from 84% to 71% since 1990, its use of gas has risen from 20% to 26%. The impact of rising costs: Given the disruptions to the supply chain caused by events in Ukraine, the impact on energy pricing is already very evident. At current price levels, it is now cheaper for many power stations to burn coal than gas. And costs aside, to maintain current energy levels while burning less Russian gas, it may be necessary to burn more coal \u2013 hardly a sustainable proposition. Investing in clean energy: Given this backdrop, European governments are under pressure to increase the use of clean energy and accelerate the delivery of green technologies. They are also assessing where nuclear power stands in the long-term energy mix, and they are looking to invest in carbon capture technologies to compensate for slow progress in reducing carbon emissions. How Europe plans to speed up the transition to clean energy Rising energy costs are making the already politically charged topic of energy even more political. Policymakers must find a balance between making energy affordable in the near term and investing in alternative energy sources over the long term. The European Commission has already commented that \u201cterminating our dangerous overdependence on fossil fuels from Russia can be achieved well before 2030\u201d. But getting there may involve acting on several fronts. Reclassifying nuclear as \u201cgreen\u201d. Nuclear power\u2019s contribution to Europe\u2019s energy mix has risen only marginally in the last 30 years, to 12.5% in 2019. The European Commission had already approved draft rules for classifying nuclear (along with gas) as \u201cgreen\u201d in the EU taxonomy \u2013 a classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities. However, the greater acceptance of nuclear as a possible core clean-energy source (albeit with waste-disposal issues) was put to the test with the shelling of Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant by Russian armed forces. Expanding renewable energy sources. Europe\u2019s renewable energy expansion appears on track, but will need to accelerate to respond to the current crisis. Its contribution to the European mix reached 22.1% in 20201 compared with only 4.3% in 19902. The European Union has targets of 32% and 60% market share for renewables for 2030 and 2050, respectively. Investing in \u201cclean tech\u201d. An ambitious pathway to achieving \u201cnet-zero\u201d carbon emissions by 2050 includes the significant expansion of renewable energy sources, increased carbon capture technologies and better energy storage. What it may mean for investors Clean tech is evolving rapidly \u2013 and needs investment Even before the situation in Ukraine brought energy issues to the fore, clean-tech investments were already a critical solution for the climate crisis. Companies that help enable both climate mitigation and adaptation may benefit significantly from Europe\u2019s energy transition. This includes firms that work on rapidly evolving technologies like energy storage, green and blue hydrogen, and grid technology, as well as more mainstream forms of renewables eg, solar and wind. Be mindful of shrinking availability of \u201crare earths\u201d and other raw materials The current crisis touches upon the access to key strategic metals and minerals required for the production of renewable energy solutions. Rare-earth elements are essential for capturing wind power; magnesium is a key component of fuel cells, plus wind and photovoltaic technology; and cobalt and natural graphite are critical for batteries and fuel-cell technology. China and Russia are responsible for most of the EU\u2019s imports of these metals and minerals. As such, given ongoing geopolitical tensions, it is difficult to ignore the scope for supply chain disruption. At the same time, as prices rise for these raw materials, previously shuttered mines outside of Russia and China may be able to restart and profitably provide local sourcing. This is a longer-term change, but it could significantly improve the scope for renewable energy development. Look into carbon-capture solutions During our AllianzGI 2021 Sustainability Days conference, we heard from Professor Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, a director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and one of the world\u2019s most influential Earth scientists. Professor Rockstr\u00f6m highlighted the importance of \u201ccarbon sinks\u201d to achieving net zero. (Carbon sinks are natural or human-made systems that can trap and store carbon emissions.) This is where the opportunity sits in carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) solutions and technologies and energy storage. According to recent International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates: CCUS facilities in operation more than tripled between 2010-2021, with the ability to capture 43.7 million tonnes of CO2. Global CO2 emission reductions from CCUS retrofits in power generation and heavy industries could reach more than 2 gigatonnes CO2 annually by 2050. The global CCUS market was estimated at USD 1.9 billion in 2020, with the capacity to grow to USD 7 billion by 2030. The current crisis has raised risks to energy security, affordability and the expansion of renewable energy sources. But it has also highlighted the necessity for accelerated investment in the European \u2013 and indeed global \u2013 energy infrastructure and mix, which provides a breadth and depth of opportunities. These extend across carbon capture and energy storage solutions, energy efficiency technologies, and local sourcing of strategic metals and minerals. Many solutions exist but need investment to achieve scalability \u2013 the growth opportunities are significant.

Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested. Equities have tended to be volatile, and do not offer a fixed rate of return. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bond prices will normally decline as interest rates rise. The impact may be greater with longer-duration bonds. Credit risk reflects the issuer\u2019s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal\u2014the lower the rating, the higher the risk of default. Emerging markets may be more volatile, less liquid, less transparent, and subject to less oversight, and values may fluctuate with currency exchange rates. Investments in alternative assets presents the opportunity for significant losses including losses which exceed the initial amount invested. Some investments in alternative assets have experienced periods of extreme volatility and in general, are not suitable for all investors.

        "content": " Look for active opportunities following the Fed\u2019s hawkish move by Gregor Hirt , Martin Hochstein, CFA | 16/03/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary The US Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate against a backdrop of high inflation and concerns about the geopolitical situation stemming from events in Ukraine. While markets have previously taken rate-hike cycles in their stride, this time could be different, as the Fed seems to be more hawkish than initially expected. Investors should actively seek out relative-return opportunities. Key takeaways The move by the US Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points was no surprise, but it comes amid the most challenging environment of any cycle kick-off since the mid-1980s Our base-case view is for a steady tightening of monetary policy by the Fed until broader financial conditions have reached a sufficiently restrictive level to tackle medium-term upside risks to inflation This environment calls for a cautious approach by investors, as we potentially enter a period of broad-based disappointing asset returns Identifying the increasing number of relative-return opportunities, rather than \u201cbuying the dips\u201d, will be key for active investors What\u2019s happened At its 15-16 March meeting, the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the federal funds target rate by 25 basis points, bringing the target range to 0.25%-0.50%. This is expected to be the first in a series of hikes that could take short-term interest rates above the neutral rate of 2.4%. (The median \u201cdot plot\u201d projections of participants indicate a fed funds rate of 2.8% by the end of 2023.) The Federal Reserve\u2019s focus is on rising inflation, higher energy prices and a tight labour market as it attempts to keep the US economy from overheating and prevent a de-anchoring of long-term inflation expectations. But the US central bank is taking nothing for granted: it has said it \u201cwill be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy ... if risks emerge\u201d. What it means The Fed\u2019s monetary policy has been exceptionally accommodative for years and, by not raising rates fast enough to stay ahead of inflation, the Fed has fallen significantly \u201cbehind the curve\u201d. Yet this rate-hike cycle is starting amid the most challenging environment of any cycle kick-off since the mid-1980s: CPI is at a 40-year high: 7.9% now* vs an average of 2.3% at the start of the six Fed rate-hike cycles since 1986. The unemployment rate is at 3.8% now vs 5.7%. The output gap is already positive, while it has previously been, on average, negative. Today\u2019s long-term real interest rates are at a deeply negative level, compared with positive real rates in all six previous cycles since 1986. With its inflation-fighting credentials at stake, the Fed has no choice but to embark on a long journey towards a tighter policy stance. Central banks cannot afford to take a lenient stance on inflation \u2013 even against the current backdrop of rising geopolitical risks (which, in the Fed\u2019s view, \u201ccreate additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity\u201d), low visibility and slowing economic growth. Moreover, the latest spike in energy and commodity prices represents a supply shock on top of already high inflation rates, and it is likely to weigh on real incomes and dampen economic activity. When implementing the necessary monetary tightening to tackle upside inflation risks, the Fed aims for a \u201csoft landing\u201d of the US economy. But when looking back at history, the odds for such an outcome appear rather slim. Four of the last five rate-hike cycles in the US were ultimately followed by a recession. Our base-case view, which seems confirmed by the Fed\u2019s 16 March statement, is for a steady tightening of monetary policy by the Fed until broader financial conditions have reached a sufficiently restrictive level to tackle medium-term upside risks to inflation. This process might be disrupted, however, if financial stability or recession risks escalate along the way. What investors should do Consider the US and UK over the euro zone The Fed had done much to prepare market participants for its latest rate decision, which explains the relatively muted equity-market reaction. Indeed, the evolution of the situation in Ukraine is more important for investors\u2019 short-term risk appetite. The longer it takes to find a negotiated solution, the more uncertainty will persist around potential impacts on global inflation through supply-chain disruptions and rising energy and agricultural prices. This also explains why we continue to have a tactical preference for the US and UK over euro-zone equities, despite more attractive valuation levels for the latter. Investors will continue to favour the relatively \u201csafer\u201d US market in US dollars and the commodity-heavy UK market, while the euro zone\u2019s growth and inflation prospects are more negatively impacted by higher energy prices. Stay wary of the bond markets Overall, an environment of moderately higher inflation tends to favour equities over bonds, even though inflation rates over 5%-6% historically penalise the equity market. The bond market could remain under pressure as it exhibits some unattractive risk premia, coupled with outflows indicating that investors are starting to question its diversification characteristics. The Fed is set to continue raising its leading interest rates \u2013 perhaps even above its neutral rate \u2013 while also soon moving to quantitative tightening \u201cat a next meeting\u201d. As such, we expect a further rise at the long end of the US yield curve, even though the immediate reaction should be for a flatter yield curve as the short end reacts more than the longer end. Yields in the euro zone are also set to rise, especially once the situation in Ukraine improves, since the European Central Bank is adhering strictly to its key target of maintaining inflation at 2%. Adopt a granular view in credit Do opportunities exist in the credit markets where spreads have widened recently? US high-yield bonds look the most promising area as yield differentials with government bonds have become attractive, especially if one expects only \u201cslowflation\u201d and not stagflation in the US. However, the view of our Multi Asset expert group is that it would take a reduction in volatility to spur us to re-enter the asset class \u2013 something we do not expect in the coming weeks. The same is true for emerging-market debt. Here, a granular view is vital: some countries will profit from higher energy prices while others could come under tremendous pressure. This is particularly true for countries already made fragile by the Covid-19 pandemic, thanks to the combination of a higher US dollar and spiking import and commodity prices (especially for agriculture goods) \u2013 a volatile mix that could lead to civil unrest. Prioritise value From a style perspective, this is certainly a market in which value \u2013 especially quality value \u2013 should continue to outperform growth. Historically, value has outperformed in environments of rising inflation, while the actual valuation differential strongly favours value versus growth. Be more active on a relative basis in equities On equities, our Multi Asset expert group maintains our \u201cneutral minus\u201d view in the short term, whereby we expect markets to move sideways with a risk to the downside. The more hawkish Fed action confirmed this view. We would therefore avoid \u201cbuying the dips\u201d for the time being and instead become much more active on a relative basis. In the medium term, we have open questions with regards to the path of equity-market performance. True, markets have typically taken previous rate-hike cycles in their stride. But there have been exceptions, including extended periods when investors were unrewarded for taking market (beta) exposure. We continue to see risks of another such period with broad-based disappointing asset returns explained by: A low starting point for nominal/real interest rates and subdued risk premia in several asset classes. The risk that the Fed may condone a \u201creverse portfolio effect\u201d to get prompt traction on broader financial conditions. Tightening into slower growth, which raises medium-term stagflation risks. Today\u2019s geopolitical volatility causing underestimated, far-reaching economic and financial market repercussions. The good news is that while the absolute-return backdrop is challenging, there will be an increasing number of relative-return opportunities for active investors. Agility will be key in this environment. US headline CPI is much higher this time around than it has been in previous rate-hike cycles CPI: current vs average of previous 6 cycles (1986 to 2018) Source: Bloomberg. Data as at 28 February 2022. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Dates of previous six Fed rate-hike cycles: 16 December 1986 to 04 September 1987; 29 March 1988 to 24 February 1989; 04 February 1994 to 01 February 1995; 30 June 1999 to 16 May 2000; 30 June 2004 to 29 June 2006; 16 December 2015 to 19 December 2018. Key terms to know Behind the curve: term used to describe when central banks do not raise interest rates fast enough to head off inflation. CPI (consumer price index): usually refers to headline CPI, also known as headline inflation. This is a key inflation metric for the US and UK, among other regions. Refers to the full hypothetical \u201cbasket\u201d of goods and services vs core CPI/core inflation. Because headline inflation is volatile, it is considered not very predictive over the short term. Fed funds target rate: the range of short-term interest rate at which banks lend to each other. Loose/easy monetary policy: economic shorthand for how central banks expand the supply of money (via low rates, asset purchases and more) to stimulate economic growth. Also known as expansionary or accommodative monetary policy. The inverse of \u201ctight\u201d monetary policy. Output gap: a measure of the amount of economic slack that can be absorbed without generating too much inflation. Quantitative easing: term used to describe central banks\u2019 purchases of bonds and other securities \u2013 a process that is intended to suppress longer-term interest rates by driving up the prices of those securities (yields fall when prices rise). The opposite of quantitative tightening. Rate-hike cycle: period of time when the Fed (or other central banks) have raised short-term interest rates, measured from the first hike to the last. Real: after inflation is factored in (as in real yields, real growth rate, etc). Reverse portfolio effect: orderly upward shift of the entire risk premium curve. Risk premia: the four key risk premia for nominal government bonds are the real risk-free rate of return, the real term premium, the expected inflation rate and the inflation risk premium. Soft landing: used to describe how central banks raise interest rates just enough to slow economic growth without causing a recession. Stagflation: a period of high inflation, slow economic growth and high unemployment. * Source: CPI data at 28 February 2022. Investing involves risk.

With half of Europe\u2019s oil and 30% to 40% of its gas imported from Russia, the invasion has escalated concerns over what Europe\u2019s existing and long-term energy mix will look like in providing the region with dependable, affordable and climate-friendly access to energy. Here, we look at some considerations for investors assessing the energy market. Key takeaways The implications of the current crisis extend beyond fossil fuels into renewable energy and climate solutions Europe needs to remedy the significant underinvestment in energy infrastructure to counter a risk of sustained energy poverty The decline in fossil fuel use is likely to be slower, so opportunities exist in carbon capture and energy storage solutions, energy efficiency technologies and local sourcing of strategic metals and minerals Load More "

        "content": " Back to basics for the Fed by Franck Dixmier | 11/03/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Against a backdrop of rising inflation, we expect the US Federal Reserve to announce a rate hike of 25 basis points at its March meeting. While the decision should not surprise markets, the Fed will likely emphasise its readiness to stay agile in the event of stronger or more persistent inflation. Key takeaways We do not expect any surprises from the next FOMC: the Federal Reserve should announce a rate hike of 0.25 percentage points to combat ever-higher inflation The Fed should also emphasise its willingness to remain agile, and to stand ready to raise rates more aggressively if necessary The markets should remain calm in the face of a decision for which they are largely prepared There are no surprises to be expected from the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which should announce a hike of 0.25 percentage points to the federal funds rate \u2013 its first increase since 2018. In order not to add stress to already highly volatile equity and bond markets, Fed Chair Jerome Powell clearly pre-empted the committee's decision. On 2 March, before the US House of Representatives Finance Committee1, he stated his desire to propose a 25-basis-point hike. This decision is consistent with inflation that continues to rise and may not have peaked yet. The latest inflation figures do not yet reflect the consequences of the Russian armed forces\u2019 invasion of Ukraine: In February, the consumer price index (CPI) increased by 0.8% (the January figure was 0.6%)2. Over one year, CPI accelerated by 7.9% (compared with 7.5% in January). This was the largest increase since 1982. Core CPI, excluding energy and food products, rose by 0.5% (0.6% in January), and by 6.4% over one year. The Fed\u2019s expected decision is in line with the attention the Fed pays to second-round effects on both wages and product prices: companies have gained significant pricing power, as highlighted in the latest Beige Book. A rise in rates is also consistent with a tightening labour market, which suggests that the objective of full employment has been achieved, paving the way for less accommodative monetary policy. Finally, the Fed must react to pressures on inflation expectations. Inflation break-evens on 5-year Treasuries rose to 3.5% from 3% at the start of the year, while the 5-year/5-year inflation swap is at 2.65%3. Mr Powell is also expected to emphasise his willingness to remain nimble, and to be ready to raise rates more aggressively, if necessary, with increases of more than 0.25% in the event of stronger or more persistent inflation. The Fed is going into emergency mode, after it missed its window to act in 2021 as the health crisis continued to blur visibility. Despite high uncertainty about the consequences of the invasion of Ukraine, in terms of growth and inflation, the Fed is clearly returning to promoting price stability \u2013 one of its fundamental mandates. This rate hike should not surprise the markets, which are expecting between six and seven hikes in 2022. However, we are not entering a bullish cycle that could unfold over several years. Investors understand that these will be tactical hikes linked to spiking inflation. The markets also anticipate rate cuts in 2024, in the face of a growing probability of the US economy entering a recession in the medium term. After the European Central Bank's speech on 10 March, the Fed's announcements should mark a return to fundamentals for central banks. Faced with price shocks \u2013 which affect society\u2019s most vulnerable and, importantly, can be a destabilising factor for democracies \u2013 central banks consider the fight against inflation to be essential for promoting political stability.

        "content": " Our investment outlook amid Ukraine uncertainty 03/03/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary The invasion of Ukraine has shaken financial markets, which were already navigating inflation and central bank monetary tightening risks. Investors should remain cautious yet prepared for investment opportunities that may arise. Key takeaways Investors may want to consider a defensive stance, including safe-haven assets like gold and longer-term government bonds Equity portfolios should remain diversified across both themes and styles, such as growth and value Within fixed-income portfolios, there might soon be opportunities to return to a neutral position on duration and to increase corporate credit risk This article is a summary of insights from our 1 March webcast on the Russian forces\u2019 invasion of Ukraine. Russian armed forces\u2019 invasion of Ukraine has added a level of geopolitical uncertainty to financial markets not seen since the second world war. Investors should stay defensive while also being positioned for opportunities the market volatility may create. While the response of markets outside Russia has been relatively modest and orderly so far, the risks are mounting. The resulting commodity price increases are effectively a tax on production \u2013 raising the possibility of stagflation1 \u2013 while the unprecedented step of excluding Russia from the financial system brings its own hazards. Markets were already facing a challenging situation even before Russian armed forces invaded Ukraine on 21 February 2022. After years of bull markets, central banks were moving to end ultra-loose monetary conditions2 and tighten policy to tackle inflation at a time when asset price valuations were high. The invasion may now delay some of the planned central bank tightening, while also raising the risk of renewed economic turmoil. \u201cWe prefer to remain defensive for now.\u201d Gregor MA Hirt, Global Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Multi-Asset, told investors during an Allianz Global Investors webcast on Ukraine on 1 March. \u201cWe had started to reduce risk in our Multi Asset Fundamental Investment Committee before the crisis, based on our expectation of stronger action by central banks. In recent weeks we have moved into further safe havens, increasing gold and \u2013 tactically, given our view on inflation \u2013 adding some longer-term government bonds. On the cyclical side, we have commodities that are adding value, both due to inflation and fears about the military aggression leading to disruption.\u201d It\u2019s often said that investors should buy on the sound of gunfire, but Mr Hirt thinks such an approach is too simplistic. For instance, it did not apply in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which drove up commodity prices and inflation in a similar way. Mr Hirt does see some opportunities emerge, though, such as US high-yield bonds, as the country\u2019s economic growth remains resilient. Back to basics in equities Within equities, Virginie Maisonneuve, Global CIO Equity, said there are several key areas of focus: How inflationary pressure will affect growth prospects and pricing power for various companies How the crisis-induced \u201csupply shock\u201d to energy and other commodities may affect a shift in competitiveness for countries and companies How Europe might accelerate its renewable-energy transformation and reconsider its energy policy within the context of national security The role of China in the global economy, given its divergent monetary policy stance as well as its geopolitical influence (eg, its relationship with Russia) \u201cIn this volatile context, and with the reduced visibility that we are seeing, we are looking at using relative price strength and weaknesses for pair trades in the portfolios,\u201d said Ms Maisonneuve. In addition, the team is actively reviewing \u201csecondary Russian exposure\u201d names \u2013 that is, companies listed outside Russia that might only have small exposure to Russia, but their share prices may have been affected disproportionately by market fear. Given the current environment, cyber-security companies are among the other opportunities to consider. The Ukraine crisis is likely to mean that the pace of rate increases by US and European central banks slows, Ms Maisonneuve noted. She expects the US Federal Reserve to tighten by 25 basis points rather than the 50 that was previously widely anticipated at its next meeting, while the European Central Bank is likely to raise rates just once in 2022 rather than twice, which had been the consensus. In this volatile environment, it\u2019s back to basics. Ms Maisonneuve believes that equity portfolios should be widely diversified across themes such as areas of technology and sustainability, as well as the styles of growth and value. In terms of growth, she asserts: \u201cYou want quality growth stocks with tangible growth, pricing power, earnings and profits.\u201d An inflection point for fixed income AllianzGI\u2019s fixed-income portfolios have been defensively positioned since the beginning of 2022, reflecting the difficulty of navigating markets at an inflection point characterised by rising inflation and tighter monetary policy, as well as the developing geopolitical crisis. With portfolios currently using just 40% of their risk budgets3, though, there is capacity to carefully add risk. \u201cHaving been underweight interest-rate duration4 last year, we've very recently moved our portfolios to be closer to neutral headline duration, and are we looking to buy in bond markets where they have priced in a lot of interest-rate rises \u2013 for example, in the US,\u201d explained Julian Le Beron, CIO Core Fixed Income. \u201cWe have been positioned quite defensively in credit as well and are close to price levels where we plan to add spread risk to our portfolios, whether that's investment-grade credit or high yield.\u201d Emerging-market bond indices needed to be carefully watched, said Mr Le Beron, in case any index providers move to drop Russia from their benchmarks. If they do, investors will have to decide what to do with any holdings of Russian bonds in an environment of thin trading liquidity. The potential reaction of central banks to higher inflation and the coming squeeze on real incomes, also needed to be taken into account, said Mr Le Beron. \u201cWe believe that the Fed will be forced to raise interest rates to address the short-term inflationary pressures, which means that the yield curve could flatten as the risks of the policy error grow,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe're concerned about the growth outlook on a more medium-term perspective. That's one of the reasons why we've been looking to move back towards a neutral position on interest-rate duration, given these concerns about growth.\u201d Such shifts in investment portfolios may need to be considered by investors seeking out opportunities amid the market volatility. But their overall approach should remain defensive in the short term. Download the pdf version 1 Stagflation: a period of high inflation, slow economic growth and high unemployment. 2 Loose/easy monetary policy: economic shorthand for how central banks expand the supply of money (via low rates, asset purchases and more) to stimulate economic growth. Also known as expansionary or accommodative monetary policy. 3 Risk budgets aim to distribute the risk of a portfolio among various asset classes with the objective of maximising total portfolio returns while minimising the total portfolio risk. 4 Duration is a measure of a bond\u2018s interest rate risk. In general, the longer the duration of a bond, the more sensitive it is to interest rate changes. Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested. Equities have tended to be volatile, and do not offer a fixed rate of return. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bond prices will normally decline as interest rates rise. The impact may be greater with longer-duration bonds. Credit risk reflects the issuer\u2019s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal\u2014the lower the rating, the higher the risk of default. Emerging markets may be more volatile, less liquid, less transparent, and subject to less oversight, and values may fluctuate with currency exchange rates.

While the decision should not surprise markets, the Fed will likely emphasise its readiness to stay agile in the event of stronger or more persistent inflation. Key takeaways We do not expect any surprises from the next FOMC: the Federal Reserve should announce a rate hike of 0.25 percentage points to combat ever-higher inflation The Fed should also emphasise its willingness to remain agile, and to stand ready to raise rates more aggressively if necessary The markets should remain calm in the face of a decision for which they are largely prepared Load More "

Our conclusion? Underlying economic factors tend to be bigger drivers of the markets than geopolitical events \u2013 so keep a close eye on the oil price, inflation and central bank actions. Key takeaways \u201cBuy on the sound of cannons\u201d is an old investment adage that isn\u2019t supported by our research into 13 geopolitical crises Stocks have sometimes (but not always) done somewhat better after the onset of global crises, and \u201csafe\u201d assets have sold off at times, but non-crisis-related factors were the bigger drivers of performance For today\u2019s investors, inflation should remain a key concern: rising oil prices are inflationary, and central banks want to keep inflation in check We remain cautious on equities for now: the markets have enjoyed years of solid performance, and the Ukraine crisis may spur additional selloffs over the coming weeks In times like these, some investors rely on an old market adage: \u201cbuy on the sound of cannons, sell on the sound of trumpets\u201d1. But is that really a good idea? To find out, we analysed the connection between geopolitical crises and financial markets, rounding up more than a dozen moments in the not-too-distant past that have parallels with the current situation. (See below for a list.) How markets have responded to 13 recent crises In our analysis, we found no way to draw clear conclusions about the effect of global crises on stocks, bonds, commodities or currencies. There have been times when markets have bounced back emphatically, and times when they haven\u2019t.2 Notable bull markets after crisis. After the two Iraq wars, for instance, the markets performed quite well. But we think there were more significant drivers of these rebounds \u2013 notably the imminent end of a recession (1991) or the bounce-back from the tech bubble (2002-2003). Notable post-crisis drops. Markets were under massive pressure after Russia\u2019s invasion of Georgia in 2008 \u2013 but this was likely a result of the global financial crisis, not the political crisis. On many other occasions, the equity market moves were non-spectacular. Overall, and as the charts below show, stocks have \u2013 on average \u2013 tended to do somewhat better after the onset of global crises. At the same time, \u201csafe\u201d assets such as US Treasuries have \u2013 on average \u2013 historically sold off slightly, causing their yields to rise. But as we explained in the examples above, non-crisis-related factors were likely the bigger drivers of performance. This is the important conclusion we draw from the past, and it does not support the idea of \u201cbuying on the sound of cannons\u201d. Rather, investors should make their decisions to buy or sell based on the health of the overall economy and the outlook for industries and earnings. Stocks have tended to rebound after global crises \u2013 particularly after the Cold War ended S&P 500 Index performance (in %) during 13 crisis periods (see list below) Post-crisis yields have tended to rise as investors moved away from \u201csafe\u201d assets 10-year Treasury performance (in basis points) during 13 crisis periods (see list below) Source for both charts: Allianz Global Investors, Refinitiv Datastream, GFD. Calculations based on market developments around GDR (17/3/1953); Hungary (28/10/1956); Cuban crisis (10/10/1962); Czechoslovakia (21/8/1968); Poland (13/12/1981); oil crisis 1 (6/10/1973); oil crisis 2 (16/1/1979); Iraq war 1 (17/1/1991); Iraq war 2 (19/3/2003); Arab Spring in Tunisia (17/10/2010); Georgia (1/8/2008); Crimea/Ukraine (3/3/2014); US-North Korea (8/8/2017). Past performance is not indicative of future results. How the markets are reacting to the crisis in Ukraine Since the Ukraine conflict started, we haven\u2019t seen signs of outright panic \u2013 at least in the main markets. The so-called \u201cfear index\u201d \u2013 the volatility index, or VIX \u2013 is currently at about 35. This is well above its long-term average of about 20, but far from the extreme values (50+) seen in recent years. The reality is that despite how volatile markets may make investors feel, price movements have been relatively restrained since the outbreak of Ukraine-Russia hostilities. It is true that the S&P 500 has lost more than 10% of its value from its peak earlier in the year, but US equity valuations are still quite high when viewed in a historical context. Moreover, the decline in European stock markets has been less dramatic, while emerging markets \u2013 excluding Russia, of course \u2013 have not changed much. Oil prices are another story. There has been a significant rise in energy prices, with both West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude trading above USD 100 \u2013 twice as high as two years ago. This is likely to leave its mark on economic growth. In the past, a doubling of the oil price within two years has repeatedly led to a recession. Against this backdrop, it is fair to wonder if central banks, especially the US Federal Reserve, will postpone or even stop the announced normalisation of monetary policy. We doubt it, in large part because of the inflation outlook. Consider that the rise in the price of oil will likely lead to higher inflation rates than previously expected. Moreover, companies and households may continue to raise their inflation expectations in light of higher energy prices\u2013 which can actually push inflation up further. Since the end of 2021, central banks have been increasingly pointing to underlying inflationary pressures and tight labour markets. Our analyses show that while we can expect a decline in the annual change in inflation rates, inflation is very likely to remain above the Western central banks' target of 2% in the medium term. Plus, the Fed regularly points out that it wants to tighten general financial conditions, not just central bank interest rates. A gradual decline in stock prices or an increase in market interest rates for loans and corporate bonds is unlikely to change that. Against this backdrop, we remain cautious on equities for the time being. The markets have enjoyed years of solid performance, and the Ukraine crisis may spur additional selloffs over the coming weeks.

        "content": " Growth. The China Way. Investors can pounce on Chinese equity market opportunities in the Year of the Tiger 25/02/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary After a year in which China\u2019s equity markets were held back by concerns over rate rises and increased regulation, the government has shifted decisively towards pro-growth policies. This creates a brighter outlook for equities in 2022. China\u2019s government has moved to a more pro-growth stance, potentially creating more favourable conditions for equity markets in 2022 Investors may want to consider shifting their China equity allocations to capture the potential benefits of easier monetary spending and higher government spending Long-term trends, including high levels of business spending on new technologies, aspirations for a healthier lifestyle and ongoing financial market reforms can deliver opportunities. This article is a summary of insights from our Q1 2022 webcast on China equities that took place in early February. Learn more about investing in China China has entered a period of easier financial conditions \u2013 including rate cuts and higher government spending \u2013 that may provide a more favourable backdrop for equity markets through 2022, the Year of the Tiger. This is a welcome change from 2021, when growth slowed and China\u2019s government tightened regulation in some sectors \u2013 notably e-commerce, financial technology and private tutoring. But today, China\u2019s fiscal and monetary policy has shifted back towards supporting the economy, according to Anthony Wong, Senior Portfolio Manager at AllianzGI and lead manager for China A-share equity portfolios. \u201cWe have already seen interest rate cuts and increased fiscal spending, and top officials in China have repeatedly emphasised the importance of stability this year,\u201d Mr Wong told investors during AllianzGI\u2019s China equities webcast on 9 February. China\u2019s objective historically has been to balance growth, stability and reform, explained Tessa Wong, Product Specialist for Chinese equities at AllianzGI. This played out in the government\u2019s shifting approach during 2021. In the first half of last year, China\u2019s country\u2019s rapid recovery from the first wave of Covid-19 brought robust economic growth, which allowed the authorities to accelerate reforms and address structural problems such as weaknesses in the property market. But in the second half, this phase came to an end as the economy slowed sharply and the government\u2019s attention turned to more pro-growth measures. Onshore-offshore divergence Yet despite a well-publicized market downturn in autumn of 2021, China equities didn\u2019t all march in lockstep. Performance was markedly different between domestically-listed A-shares, which are traded in \u201conshore\u201d exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen; and the stocks traded in \u201coffshore\u201d markets, primarily Hong Kong and the US. Despite weak market sentiment, the A-shares market ended 2021 up 4%1 and attracted net monthly inflows of foreign capital throughout the year, as global investors used a period of weakness to build their long-term allocations to China. However, the government\u2019s tightening of regulation on internet-related sectors last year had a major impact on offshore markets, where many internet companies are listed. Offshore equities fell more than 20% during 20212. This drop was caused by a rapid derating of valuations as the Chinese government\u2019s regulatory changes caused sentiment to weaken, rather than a collapse in earnings expectations. By the end of 2021, both the onshore MSCI China A index and the offshore MSCI China index were trading close to their long-run average valuations, in contrast to some developed markets where valuations remain stretched by historical standards. To many investors, China equities today seem more reasonably priced than their developed market counterparts. Long-term trends are supportive, though risk factors remain Even though the policy backdrop is becoming more supportive for equity markets, important risk factors remain. China is maintaining tough public health restrictions to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant. If the virus escapes these controls, efforts to contain it could seriously disrupt the economy. China\u2019s huge property market has also been causing concern. Several highly indebted property developers ran into liquidity problems last year as limits on leverage were introduced and the market slowed. However, Mr Wong believes the government will find a way to engineer a \u201cmanaged decline\u201d in property prices rather than a crash. \u201cIf there are signs that the Chinese economy is decelerating further, we believe more aggressive rate cuts and fiscal policy actions will be taken by the government to cushion that downside risk,\u201d Mr Wong said. To capture the benefits of easier monetary spending and higher government spending, investors may want to consider shifting their China equity allocations to the exchanges and sectors that may be poised to benefit. Within the A-shares market, there are opportunities from domestic wealth managers, potential beneficiaries from rising household wealth and appetite to invest in financial markets Opportunities also exist in the long-term trends of healthy living and new technologies. The latter covers augmented and virtual reality, and the semi-conductor supply chain But investors may want to be more cautious about areas linked to the property sector, such as materials companies. The oft-cited mantra that housing is \u2018for living in, not speculation\u2019 suggests there is unlikely to be a quick rebound Mr Wong added that the much discussed \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d policy, a central objective of the Chinese government, was not intended to involve state-sponsored redistribution of wealth, as often assumed in the West. Instead, it aimed to address more systemic long-term issues for China \u2013 including high levels of leverage, wealth disparity and slowing growth. He believes that the common prosperity policy would not deflect China from its journey towards financial and economic liberalisation. Access to foreign capital and a vibrant private sector would remain central priorities for the Chinese government. For investors, China\u2019s shift towards easier financial conditions, coupled with undemanding valuations, creates a more supportive backdrop for the country\u2019s equity markets in the Year of the Tiger.

Our conclusion? Underlying economic factors tend to be bigger drivers of the markets than geopolitical events \u2013 so keep a close eye on the oil price, inflation and central bank actions. Key takeaways \u201cBuy on the sound of cannons\u201d is an old investment adage that isn\u2019t supported by our research into 13 geopolitical crises Stocks have sometimes (but not always) done somewhat better after the onset of global crises, and \u201csafe\u201d assets have sold off at times, but non-crisis-related factors were the bigger drivers of performance For today\u2019s investors, inflation should remain a key concern: rising oil prices are inflationary, and central banks want to keep inflation in check We remain cautious on equities for now: the markets have enjoyed years of solid performance, and the Ukraine crisis may spur additional selloffs over the coming weeks Load More "

        "content": " Ukraine: investors should prioritise caution by Gregor Hirt | 24/02/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary As Russia begins a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, already vigilant investors should adopt an even more cautious position in risky assets. While the full course of the conflict is yet to be known, the implications will be wide-ranging for markets, as rising energy prices push up already high inflation. Key takeaways As Russian forces invade Ukraine, vigilance should be the watchword for investors, as the conflict could take many turns, and the humanitarian costs could be vast. Rising commodity prices would have a negative impact in an environment already dominated by higher inflation, with implications for growth and potentially monetary policy. We are watching carefully for any disruption to market liquidity, and suggest a cautious stance as market participants may reduce exposures to risky assets after years of solid performance. What has happened? So it seems that the rather timid sanctions from the West were not a deterrent for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Perhaps they were even an incentive for him to move ahead and launch a full-scale attack against Ukraine, in what now appears to be the most dramatic security crisis in Europe since World War Two. Russian forces have even begun to target the densely populated capital city, Kyiv. While Ukraine is a big country with an army previously ranked among the 30 most powerful in the world, there should be no doubt that Russia could rapidly control its airspace and destroy all key military facilities within days. The bigger question is: where will Russian ground forces and their allies stop their advance? A rapid blitz on key strategic targets would be the best-case scenario from the Russian perspective, as Moscow can hardly afford a long-term occupation and mass casualties among its armies. However, we should be fully aware \u2013 with Mr Putin\u2019s angry television speech in mind \u2013 that there is indeed a potential worst-case scenario where Russian forces come into direct contact with NATO troops. Such an escalation would undoubtedly have significant ramifications for markets, not to mention the potentially vast humanitarian costs. What was the market reaction? Early on Thursday, the S&P future was sharply down (-2.5%) and the Euro Stoxx future tumbled by more than 4%, while oil and gold were among the key safe havens bought by investors. Gas price futures are also spiking. This will likely hit the lower middle classes in most European countries hardest, leading to weaker growth, while potential blackouts could lead to production slowdown, also negatively impacting growth. Of course, this would also lead to higher inflation rates, as gas and gasoline prices continue rising and chemicals become more expensive. The ECB will be in a difficult situation. Inflation numbers are already at record levels, which had led markets to speculate on interest rate hikes this year. Nevertheless, an increase in commodity prices is, in effect, a \u201ctax\u201d on production and consumption that would negatively impact growth. So, while inflation rates could continue to rise, the ECB may adopt a more bearish stance for the time being. Overall, rising commodity prices are set to result in weaker global growth and Europe would likely be the most affected region. What does this mean for asset allocation? Our Multi Asset Fundamental Investment Committee had already recommended increasing the allocations to safe havens such as US Treasuries and gold. Wednesday\u2019s rather muted market reaction puzzled us, and so we think an even more cautious position in risky assets would be appropriate for the time being. We hold to our positive view on commodities, even though the market reaction could lead to some production support from OPEC. Importantly, we are also watching for potential disruption to market liquidity, especially in Russian or Russian-related securities as these will be impacted \u2013 increasingly \u2013 by EU and US sanctions. The EU will prohibit the buying or selling directly or indirectly of any financial instrument issued on or after 9 March by the Russian government, its central bank, government agencies, or any person acting on their behalf. This means that Russia is now excluded from issuing new debt or refinancing its debt. Substantial outflows from any related Russian instruments could ensue, and there could be knock-on effects for widely used instruments such as ETFs and derivatives. All in all, after a few years of solid performance for equities and other risky assets, this crisis may spur market participants to reduce their exposures over the coming weeks. We therefore continue to favour a cautious stance. Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested.

This creates a brighter outlook for equities in 2022. China\u2019s government has moved to a more pro-growth stance, potentially creating more favourable conditions for equity markets in 2022 Investors may want to consider shifting their China equity allocations to capture the potential benefits of easier monetary spending and higher government spending Long-term trends, including high levels of business spending on new technologies, aspirations for a healthier lifestyle and ongoing financial market reforms can deliver opportunities.

        "content": " Unlocking the \u201cS\u201d in capitalism 09/02/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Social issues have typically been overshadowed by other aspects of the sustainability story such as climate. That\u2019s changing. The Covid-19 pandemic has shone a light on inequalities in access to basic essentials and life opportunities \u2013 and the solution calls for a new brand of capitalism. Key takeaways The Covid-19 pandemic shone a light on the weaknesses of the modern just-in-time economy and was a stark reminder that many communities experience inequalities in accessing both life and livelihood essentials Recent events have led to a renewed focus on the \u201cS\u201d in ESG \u2013 the social issues that can hold back the growth and resilience of economies, and may be exacerbated by climate change and digitalisation The concept of \u201cinclusive capitalism\u201d is gaining steam as part of a more inclusive approach to economic growth, and it should be addressed alongside our other sustainability pillars at AllianzGI \u2013 climate change and planetary boundaries \u2013 with which it is closely interdependent By addressing inclusive capitalism via their investments, investors can accelerate the journey to a more equal world while capitalising on significant growth opportunities as new approaches and infrastructure come online The \u201cS\u201d in ESG \u2013 the environmental, social and governance factors that are a core part of sustainable investing \u2013 has long been overshadowed by other aspects of the sustainability story. Yet today, social issues are increasingly coming into focus. One reason is the Covid-19 pandemic, which has exposed serious problems that can arise when countries or communities lack the resources and opportunities that others take for granted. In the worst situations, these communities may be marginalised from society entirely, experiencing what is known as \u201csocial exclusion\u201d. There\u2019s also growing recognition that social issues are firmly interconnected with the \u201cE\u201d in ESG \u2013 namely the environment and climate change \u2013 and that all these themes should be addressed together. At Allianz Global Investors, we understand the importance of social issues to today\u2019s world. In fact, it\u2019s a core reason why the concept of \u201cinclusive capitalism\u201d is one of the three thematic pillars of our sustainability focus \u2013 alongside climate change and planetary boundaries such as biodiversity. Inclusive capitalism is integral to our goal of working with our clients to drive an inclusive, fairer and more sustainable world. We think it opens up new markets and growth opportunities as companies innovate to resolve inequalities and address the needs of underserved communities. Why inequality is a growing concern Defining inequality Addressing inequalities is at the heart of the focus on social issues \u2013 but what does inequality really mean? Income and wealth inequality are one of the main areas that need attention, but we believe financial considerations are not the only way to measure inequality. Around the world there are also big disparities in access to basic needs \u2013 the \u201clife essentials\u201d that include food, water and clean air (see Exhibit 1). People also lack \u201clivelihood essentials\u201d such as education and infrastructure. These are necessary for people to participate in economic, social and civic processes and lead productive and creative lives. In fact, UNESCO has found that \u201csocially excluded\u201d people who lack these livelihood essentials \u201cfind themselves confined to the fringes of society\u201d.1 Covid hits schooling The closing of classrooms during the pandemic has pushed 101 million children globally below the minimum reading proficiency threshold; seven million are in Western Europe and North America2. And according to the World Bank, children affected by learning losses stand to lose USD 10 trillion in future lifetime earnings \u2013 equivalent to 8% of global GDP.3 Covid-19: exposing inequalities The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the problems of exclusion and inequality, with implications beyond health and wellbeing. It\u2019s more obvious than ever that many basic needs, such as food and healthcare, are not guaranteed for many of our communities. Many people also lack access to the kind of education and financial services that would help them build better lives. These shortcomings help explain why during this crisis, progress in fighting poverty has gone into reverse. The rate of extreme poverty rose from 8.4% in 2019 to 9.5% in 2020 \u2013 the first global increase since 1998.4 These inequalities manifest themselves in various ways. In a survey by our Grassroots Research\u00ae team, 27% of French educators cited major issues with online learning during the pandemic, especially for low-income students and those in rural areas who do not have an adequate internet connection or hardware.5 And since robust technology is increasingly critical to earning a living \u2013 particularly with the growth in home working \u2013 the \u201cdigital divide\u201d between those who have adequate digital infrastructure and those who do not is a significant new driver of inequalities. Exhibit 1: life and livelihood essentials explained Another major driver is climate change. Local environmental resources are crucial for a high proportion of the poorest populations, and these resources are affected by global warming. For instance, under the medium scenario for population development, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that at 1.5\u00b0C warming 178 million people \u2013 including a high proportion of women, children and the elderly \u2013 will be affected by water stress, drought intensity and habitat degradation by 2050. At 2\u00b0C warming this figure rises to 220 million people.6 Inequality is a problem for everyone The Covid-19 pandemic is the most obvious recent example of a global crisis that has brought global inequality into stark relief. But think about the recent financial crises and increasingly regular extreme weather events. Inequalities undermine our capacity as a society to mitigate and overcome the impact of major crises like these, and as such they are a concern for everyone: Covid-19 showed how the economy relies on global and tight supply chains and exposed the lack of resilience in the \u201cjust in time\u201d model. Broken and delayed supply chains affect everyone. Consider the repercussion of a dock workers\u2019 strike on the global supply of goods. Or the effect on the price we would have to pay if the \u201cfair\u201d cost of these goods was applied that includes the social and environmental costs. Sustained inequalities often result in heightened political or even geopolitical risks. This environment is typically negative for economic growth, since it raises costs and limits the availability of capital. In many regions of the world, this has led to large-scale refugee crises. Bridging the digital divide Some 2.9 billion people remain offline globally \u2013 equal to around 37% of the world population \u2013 with 96% of them living in developing countries. Those who remain unconnected face multiple barriers, including a lack of access: some 390 million people are not even covered by a mobile broadband signal.7 Shifting the economic model towards inclusive capitalism It is time for society and economy to move to an inclusive and fair world A persistent, decades-long rise in gross domestic product (GDP) in many countries has increased overall living standards and lifted many people out of poverty. This is proof of the power of capitalism. However, measuring GDP has its limitations. It cannot shed light on unequal income distribution. Nor does GDP give any insight into other types of societal inequality \u2013 including less access to healthcare, education or infrastructure. According to the Allianz Global Wealth report, the richest 10% of the world\u2019s population together owned more than 84% of total net financial assets in 2020, and the middle class is shrinking.8 And figures from the OECD show that median incomes grew more slowly than top incomes since the mid1980s \u2013 and the Covid-19 pandemic made this trend worse. Exhibit 2: median incomes grow more slowly than top incomes Real disposable income growth by income position, average for 17 OECD countries, 1985 2016 (1985 = 100%) Note: Unweighted average for 17 countries for which long-term data are available: Canada, Germany, Denmark, Finland, France, United Kingdom, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Sweden and United States. Incomes are disposable incomes, corrected for household size Source: Chapter 2, OECD calculations from OECD Income Distribution Database. Data as at April, 2019. StatLink Data This is where the concept of inclusive capitalism is gaining steam as part of a more inclusive approach to economic growth. Consider the World Economic Forum\u2019s (WEF) recently launched Inclusive Growth Framework. In its 2020 Davos manifesto, the WEF upgraded the purpose of a company to encompass all its stakeholders \u2013 employees, customers, suppliers, local communities and society at large \u2013 in shared and sustained value creation.9 Furthermore, over 190 countries have adopted the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to support a better and more sustainable future for all. By highlighting priorities such as \u201czero poverty\u201d, \u201cdecent work and economic growth\u201d and \u201cquality education\u201d, the 17 SDGs provide a roadmap for companies to address these issues in the way they run their organisations and through their products and services. Social insecurity Before the pandemic, informal employment represented 60% of global employment. This means that 2 billion people worldwide worked in jobs characterised by lack of basic protection, including social protection coverage.10 With its focus on reflecting the needs of women, youth and local and marginalised communities in climate-related planning, SDG 13: Climate Action is particularly germane to this discussion of inclusive capitalism. SDG 13 highlights how the journeys towards both an inclusive world and a 1.5 degree-aligned world are tightly interwoven. Consider how moving to a low-carbon economy can have social repercussions, for instance if jobs are jeopardised by the shift away from fossil fuels. This is the impetus behind the calls for a \u201cjust transition\u201d. At COP26 in November 2021, more than 30 nations signed the Just Transition Declaration acknowledging \u201cthe need to ensure that no one is left behind in the transition to net zero economies\u201d.11 And this is a two-way interdependence, as human capital has to be \u201cunlocked\u201d to secure the skills necessary for climate transition. Clearly, the SDGs can provide a much-needed roadmap to address some of the world\u2019s most pressing issues related to sustainability. Early results are promising: of the 8,550 companies in the MSCI All Country World Index, nearly 40% have aligned with multiple SDGs (see Exhibit 3). Of those companies, SDG 5: Gender Equality was among the top ranked in terms of alignment. But other companies still have work to do: 7% of firms were assessed as \u201cmisaligned\u201d, noticeably on SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy.12 Exhibit 3: companies are grappling with sustainability Level of corporate alignment with SDGs 8,550 Companies This chart displays distribution of companies\u2019 assessment by SDG for a set of 8,550 companies, as at 11 August, 2020. Source: MSCI ESG Research LLC. Data as at August 2020. Closing the gap with climate While these steps are encouraging, there is still less attention paid to building a more inclusive world than addressing climate change and the environment. The UN\u2019s High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development \u2013 in effect, the SDG equivalent of the climate COP \u2013 had only its 13th iteration this year and received scant media coverage. What could explain this gap? We see both a lack of urgency and a sense that inequalities are happening in more remote countries. In addition, there are intrinsic challenges in managing social factors. Whereas the fight against climate change has a clear and measurable focus \u2013 ie, achieving net-zero emissions to stop warming \u2013 there is no single unifying quantitative goal for creating a fair and inclusive world. There is also the question of how to measure sustainable development. It encompasses multiple topics \u2013 from education, ways of working and retirement to health and financial considerations. Moreover, there are significant cultural and legal differences across countries and regions. But while the S has been a poor cousin to the E and G of ESG, it is still gaining prominence. Social issues are particularly important to millennials and Generation Z investors. And even though inequalities have increasingly come into focus in the US, this awareness is now being exported to other parts of the world. Our framework for inclusive capitalism at Allianz Global Investors Thanks to their experience with the climate transition, many investors increasingly recognise they have the power to make a positive impact through where and how they invest their capital. This applies equally to the transition to a more inclusive world. Indeed, as a firm with strong ESG credentials, Allianz Global Investors has been active for several years in integrating people-related sustainability factors in investment processes.13 As part of our ESG risk assessment, we seek to identify where investee companies may need to enhance their approach to labour relations or consider more holistically their impact on local communities. New skills needed The shift away from fossil fuels is estimated by the International Energy Agency to displace around 5 million jobs. But about 30 million new workers are needed by 2030 to meet increased demand for clean energy and low-emissions technologies; over half are highly skilled positions.14 But we know there is more that we \u2013 and the industry \u2013 can do. By making inclusive capitalism our third sustainability research theme, we are granting proper resources and efforts to identify emerging issues, driving awareness and creating change. With the interdependencies of social, climate change and environment, we will be able to address this topic alongside our other two thematic pillars: climate change and planetary boundaries. Our analysis in framing and structuring inclusive capitalism led us to distinguish life essentials and livelihood essentials. We also believe that inequalities and exclusions deserve the same level of attention, as exclusions are generally the consequence of inequalities that have been stretched beyond their tipping point, including by the pandemic. This focus will likely lead to product innovation, including new impact-focused investment strategies. It will also inform proxy-voting decisions and define themed engagement projects, which is a proven tool for increasing awareness among corporations. Concerted actions via joint initiatives, including the UN Principles for Responsible Investing, will continue to be another lever to drive change.15 Vaccine inequality For every 100 people, around 68 vaccines were administered in Europe and Northern America, compared with fewer than two in sub-Saharan Africa.16 Urgent next steps The world must take its lessons from the pandemic that revealed the need for a shift of our economic and societal model. Global leaders are setting the tone by addressing social topics. The planned introduction in 2022 by the EU of a Social Taxonomy, the social dimension of US President Joe Biden\u2019s infrastructure plan, and China\u2019s focus on \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d are strong signs that the tide is turning. We see this as the right moment to take an active stance on inclusive capitalism alongside climate change and the environment. These interwoven priorities, while representing the biggest challenges facing our planet, unlock new opportunities for investors to support the transition to a more inclusive and sustainable world.

While the full course of the conflict is yet to be known, the implications will be wide-ranging for markets, as rising energy prices push up already high inflation. Key takeaways As Russian forces invade Ukraine, vigilance should be the watchword for investors, as the conflict could take many turns, and the humanitarian costs could be vast. Rising commodity prices would have a negative impact in an environment already dominated by higher inflation, with implications for growth and potentially monetary policy. We are watching carefully for any disruption to market liquidity, and suggest a cautious stance as market participants may reduce exposures to risky assets after years of solid performance.

        "content": " Embracing Disruption Digital Darwinism: the new disruption by Virginie Maisonneuve | 08/02/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Disruption has always been around us, but we are moving to a new \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d digital era. We\u2019ve identified key themes \u2013 from climate tech to AI \u2013 that are driving this new shift in a profound way, making disruption a critical factor for investors to build into their portfolios. Key takeaways Disruption is no longer just a tech-sector phenomenon: transformative advances in hardware, software and \u201cBig Data\u201d mean that disruption is now reaching into every area of our lives Profound changes wrought by technology are leading to a kind of \u201cdigital Darwinism\u201d \u2013 a race for dominance that is redefining the winners and creating new opportunities for investors The fight for technology supremacy has wider resonance: watch for rising geopolitical tensions as countries vie to control more of the world\u2019s data Though disruption at this scale can be unsettling, investors can participate in this global shift to seek growth potential: thematic investing and sustainability can provide a window into future opportunities It is time to rethink what you thought you knew about disruption. It was once primarily associated with the technology sector \u2013 particularly the new platforms that were shaking up traditional means of ride-hailing, rentals, food delivery and more. But now, transformative advances in hardware and software \u2013 and the sheer proliferation of data \u2013 are pushing disruptive forces into more sectors and areas of our lives than ever before \u2013 and at an exponential rate. This is leading to a kind of \u201cdigital Darwinism\u201d \u2013 a global phenomenon that will sweep some businesses aside, allow others to secure a dominant market share and potentially even affect the world\u2019s geopolitical order. Like the evolutionary process after which it\u2019s named, digital Darwinism is a shift at the cellular level, and it\u2019s changing the world we live in. But there\u2019s good news for investors. Not only can you invest in and benefit from growth and profit opportunities \u2013 you can also contribute to positive real-world outcomes. Three key investment themes for the new disruption 1. Climate & technology In May 2021, US climate change envoy John Kerry claimed that half of the reductions necessary to achieve net-zero emissions \u201care going to come from technologies we don\u2019t yet have\u201d. \u201cClimate tech\u201d advancements \u2013 from artificial intelligence (AI) powered marketplaces for carbon offsets to improved power transmission infrastructure \u2013 can help reduce the impact of global warming. According to PwC, in the year leading up to June 2021, USD 87.5 billion was invested in companies combating the climate crisis, compared with USD 24.8 billion the year before.1 And since 2013, more than 60% of all venture capital funding has poured into technologies related to mobility and transport \u2013 an area that includes electric vehicles. (See chart.) There also seems to be a disconnect between the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that certain sectors produce compared with the funding they receive. For example, only 9% of funding went to manufacturing during the same period, even though it contributed 29% of GHG emissions. This could give investors a prime opportunity to fund new climate-focused technologies. Many emissions-reducing technologies may be underfunded Share of global emissions and climate tech venture investment by challenge area Source: PwC \u201cState of Climate Tech\u201d 2021. 2. Data & connectivity With so much of the world\u2019s population connected digitally, disruptive innovations can sweep across the globe at a breakneck pace. Consider that more than 60% of the world\u2019s population is connected to the internet2 \u2013 compared with approximately zero percent in the early 1980s. All this connectivity is generating 2.5 quintillion bytes of data a day3. What\u2019s more, the internet of things (IoT)4 grew by 9% in 2021, reaching 12.3 billion connections5. And \u201c6G\u201d technology (where China is currently leading the way) could be 100 times more powerful than 5G. This could move far beyond \u201csmart homes\u201d to \u201csmart cities\u201d, which could help address significant economic, social and environmental challenges. So what is all this infrastructure \u2013 and the data it transmits \u2013 leading to? The next phase of the internet \u2013 which some call the \u201cmetaverse\u201d \u2013 could bring the virtual and online worlds closer together. How many students would not prefer to \u201cwalk\u201d into an old Roman village rather than simply read about it, and who wouldn\u2019t want to \u201ctour\u201d a remodeled kitchen before work starts? The metaverse could lead to new revenue streams for well-positioned companies, especially those connected to fields such as shopping, education, entertainment and electronic payment systems. 3. Man & machine Throughout history, there have been great evolutionary leaps that have propelled life forward \u2013 the original \u201cbiological disruption\u201d. We may be approaching a similar moment today. Some estimate that by 2045, machine learning and AI could usher in the \u201csingularity\u201d \u2013 the moment when machines will be smarter than humans.7 But even if that moment never comes, new technologies are having a profound impact on the quality and length of life. Consider how science seems to be following its own \u201cMoore\u2019s law\u201d, with new technologies being implemented at an increasingly rapid rate while the cost steadily declines. The fast-growing field of genomics8 offers the prospect of earlier identification and treatment of genetic illnesses, and has led to the speedy introduction of new solutions to the Covid-19 crisis. And in the field of nanotechnology9, scientists have developed an injectable \u201cliquid retinal prosthesis\u201d that may someday be able to help blind people see again.10 Prepare for \u201cdigital Darwinism\u201d Just as Charles Darwin and other naturalists expounded a theory of evolution founded on the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d, we are seeing a competitive landscape reshaped by the ability of individual businesses to adapt and thrive. But the \u201cwinner takes all\u201d implications of this race to technology supremacy \u2013 and the influence that comes with it \u2013 has wider resonance. Arguably it is at the heart of geopolitical tensions, for example between the US and China, perhaps even more so than questions around trade. Control of data gives control of power. And with an imperative to protect digitised businesses, robust cybersecurity is a must. The cost of global cybercrime could reach USD 10.5 trillion in 2025, up from USD 3 trillion in 201511. This represents a fast-growing industry in itself: global spending on cybersecurity is estimated to exceed USD 1.75 trillion from 2021-2025.12 Two takeaways for investors 1. Rethink how portfolios are constructed In this low-yield environment, where growth and income potential are at a premium, it\u2019s important to take a different approach to portfolio construction \u2013 one that may be able to capitalise on disruptive opportunities. Perhaps in addition to core diversified funds, investors should consider these areas: Thematic investing can help investors capitalise on opportunities emerging from this wave of disruption. Thematic funds \u2013 such as those focused on \u201chealthy living\u201d or \u201csmart cities\u201d \u2013 can provide a window into future opportunities, a new prism alongside traditional ways of classifying investments by sector or geography. Sustainability in all its guises is an essential consideration for investors today \u2013 particularly the need to combat climate change, which is one of the dangerously disruptive forces in the world. Fortunately, investors can align their portfolios with investments that can help effect real-world change. \u201cGreen\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d bonds can help finance projects specifically associated with climate change and ocean conservation. But sustainability has also moved beyond climate, and now impacts every area of our lives. Investments aligned with the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals can help align countries, organisations, companies and individuals from around the world to help protect the planet, end poverty and improve life for communities globally. Disruption and sustainability go hand-in-hand from an investment perspective. When seeking to identify the winners of this era of disruption, it is more critical than ever to use sustainability factors to assess the true roots of resilience, success and longevity for the companies we invest in. 2. Tap the power of disruptive tech in the investment process To take full advantage of the \u201cnew\u201d disruption, investors should incorporate new, possibly disruptive technologies into their investment process. Consider all the factors that go into creating long-term investment solutions \u2013 whether growth or value, fundamental or quantitative. Portfolio managers must assess business models and valuations, analyse sustainability factors, and evaluate management teams, corporate governance and organisational culture. The ability to harness the explosion of available data on companies and trends \u2013 from multiple sources around the world in real time \u2013 is critical. So is the ability to analyse it expertly \u2013 and focus on what is relevant. At Allianz Global Investors, we are constantly developing tools to support our portfolio managers in their search for alpha \u2013 including financial and \u201coutcome-linked\u201d alpha \u2013 while staying agile in the face of changing market conditions. Within our investment processes, we are using data in greater volumes than ever before. We are deploying AI and natural language processing (NLP) in multiple languages to put the latest insight at our fingertips. Disruption may be intrinsically unsettling. But we are convinced that it is something to be embraced because of the opportunities it presents and the sheer, urgent necessity of turning its repercussions to your advantage. How a grain of rice can illustrate exponential growth Recall the Indian folk story of the origins of the game of chess. Thrilled with this new game, the king asked its inventor what he would like in return. The inventor asked for one grain of rice for the first square of the chessboard, two for the second, four for the third and so on \u2013 the amount doubling with each square. The king agreed to this apparently modest request, but by the 64th square, he owed 18 quintillion grains of rice \u2013 enough to cover India in a layer one metre deep. Download the pdf version 1.

        "content": " Active is: Seeing opportunity where others see challenge With so much for markets to digest, investors need to be agile by Gregor Hirt | 25/01/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Markets are off to a rocky start to 2022, as challenges ranging from a more hawkish Fed to sabre-rattling in Ukraine test investors\u2019 resolve. Despite fading support from central banks, investors can find opportunities by staying agile and focusing on companies with resilient earnings. Key takeaways This year is unlikely to be plain sailing for the financial markets, and the first weeks have confirmed this diagnosis Even though investors have a lot of issues to navigate, markets still offer potential \u2013 the key is to be agile The overall long-term \u201cexcess liquidity\u201d environment is morphing into a more hawkish, restrictive one \u2013 so earnings resilience should be a focus for investors Given the backdrop, we prefer cyclical value to growth-oriented companies After a relatively calm holiday break, the first weeks of the year have already confirmed our assumption that 2022 would not be a \u201cstraight line\u201d, to say the least. The latest weakness in quite a few markets, especially in the US, led to some technical support levels being broken, as some indexes fell below what were assumed to be price \u201cfloors\u201d. As January tends to be a robust month for risky assets, the retreat comes at an unusual point in time. The fact that many investors still have relatively long exposures or overweights likely explains part of the profit-taking. But the bigger issue may be that markets simply have too much to digest. While market participants can take one problem at a time in their stride, they came back from the holidays to face several issues, including: A more hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) narrative and the fiscal challenges in the US. Sabre-rattling in Ukraine. The prospect of war in Ukraine is understandably weighing on investors\u2019 minds, and the probability of conflict may have worsened in recent days. But the market impact could be short-lived based on the experience of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2014, when equity indices recovered rapidly. This time, however, already-high commodity prices and bottlenecks could have a stronger economic impact on the European economy. Renewed tensions in China\u2019s real estate market. Our base case remains that the Chinese government manages to control the timing of the real estate slowdown, but even so the probability of a bursting of the debt bubble has slightly increased. Should investors buy the dip? Should we fear a repeat of the 2018 market dive that saw US stocks drop 19%? Or is this just another short-lived correction and investors should \u201cbuy the dip\u201d? Despite what we are hearing in the press, it is not entirely true that the market has run out of breath. Indeed, while low-quality stocks have suffered, the equal-weighted US equity markets have remained pretty much aligned with the capital-weighted market. Remember as well that, based on past experience, a Fed rate hike \u201cper se\u201d is not always negative on stocks (see Exhibit 1). This is even less so for stocks outside the US. Since markets have been digesting Fed rate hikes for months, a lot of negativity should already be priced in. Exhibit 1: US stocks have historically shrugged off Fed rate hikes within a year Average S&P 500 Index returns during Fed rate-hike cycles (1986-2015) Source: Bloomberg, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 17 January 2022. All-time average performance based on rolling overlapping observation period; rate hike period performance based on mid-month observations (15th). Past performance is not indicative of future results. But we could imagine a secondary scenario, where falling inflation later this year coincides with slower economic growth caused by the impact of earlier price rises on consumers. This may force the Fed to put its rate hikes on hold. Similarly, if inflation starts to impact wages and rents, the European Central Bank (ECB) could turn out to be surprisingly hawkish \u2013 resulting in higher or faster rate hikes than the markets expect. This would detract from our positive view on the US dollar. Overall, however, we must recognise that the overall long-term environment of excess liquidity \u2013 with central banks greatly increasing the economy\u2019s money supply \u2013 is morphing into a more hawkish, restrictive one. The fight against inflation will be the focus of the Fed\u2019s attention for at least the coming month. As central banks tighten up the money supply, it will likely remove one of the pillars that have supported the strong performance of risky assets like stocks. Strangely enough, the \u201cgood news\u201d about Omicron\u2019s rapid fading and relative lack of fatality could provide comfort to central banks in their new \u201creaction\u201d function. So it will be a fine balance: good news from the trade logistics and supply chain front could be negated by stricter central bank policies. Watch for earnings All of this should encourage us to look even more carefully than in the past at earnings, especially as valuations remain stretched (especially in the US, although arguably less so in Europe and Japan). And here the picture could also start deteriorating as employment and commodity costs start biting into companies\u2019 profit margins (see Exhibit 2). This trend will likely affect smaller US companies that have trouble finding staff, while larger companies should continue to profit from the \u201coligopolisation\u201d that has taken place over the last decade in many sectors of the economy. This should allow them to pass on some of the higher costs of producing their goods or services, even though this would be to the detriment of consumers. Exhibit 2: employment and commodity costs could start shrinking profit margins Net profit margins vs employment costs (1984-2022) Source: Refinitiv Datastream, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 18 January 2022. What does this mean for asset allocation? Investors should keep a calm head and observe the situation carefully. As the fundamental picture weakens, and the excess liquidity and support of central banks fades, the resilience of corporate earnings should be the key focus. Considering the relative valuations, the US stockmarket might be a notch more affected than Europe or Japan. This differential is beginning to be reflected in the relative preference of our Multi Asset expert group. We continue to support value stocks (whose prices appear to be lower than what the financials support) as opposed to growth stocks (which carry higher prices in exchange for the potential for more growth down the road). More to the point, we prefer cyclical value stocks in particular \u2013 those whose prices tend to move in tandem with the economy. And, despite a short-term topping-out, we continue to see valuations as attractive in the longer term (see Exhibit 3). We expect US Treasuries to fall in value in the short term, as we still expect inflation to surprise on the upside. But with Fed interventions, we could pretty soon be in a position to be more positive about Treasuries if markets move ahead of themselves. And finally, commodities continue to represent an attractive hedge in this environment if one considers that the inflation risk remains underestimated. To summarise: agility will be required in the coming weeks.

Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested. Equities have tended to be volatile, and do not offer a fixed rate of return. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bond prices will normally decline as interest rates rise. The impact may be greater with longer-duration bonds.

Additionally, the comparatively low weight of plastic packaging contributes to energy and fuel savings, and to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from freight transport. However, the advantages of plastics have to be set against a number of drawbacks, particularly for the environment. The absence of a circular plastic economy, and the leakage of millions of tonnes of plastic material, not only contribute in large part to marine pollution, but also trigger immense economic costs, and billions of USD in negative externalities. Fostering the further development of sustainable packaging therefore not only helps to limit the volume of plastic waste, but also offers attractive opportunities to participate in a market that is predicted to show a double-digit percentage growth rate within the next five years. Key takeaways According to analysis, 95% of plastic packaging material value, equivalent to between USD 80\u2013120 billion per year, leaves the economy (in the form of waste).1 The recycling rate of plastics is only around 14%. Due to additional value losses during sorting and reprocessing, only about 5% of plastic packaging is reused for packaging, while most of the remaining 9% is used for lower-value applications.2 Nearly a third of all plastic packaging is not available for recycling.3 Plastic packaging contributes almost USD 40 billion-worth of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental damage every year.4 Expenditures arising from these post-use effects, as well as from greenhouse gas emissions caused by plastic production, amount to at least USD 40 billion annually.5 The sustainable-packaging market is expected to grow from an estimated USD 305 billion in 2020 to almost USD 470 billion in 2027.6 The price tag of \u201cplastubiquity\u201d \"Around the world, one million plastic drinking bottles are purchased every minute, while 5 trillion single-use plastic bags are used worldwide every year.7\" In the modern economy plastic has become indispensable, ubiquitous and maybe the most versatile material in terms of applications. Its success is primarily based on its exceptional functional characteristics \u2013 in numerous potential application areas such as construction, transportation, healthcare and electronics \u2013 as well as on its comparatively low production costs. However low the manufacturing \u201cprice tag\u201d might be, the lifetime costs of plastics are very high. A WWF report suggests that in 2019 the plastic pollution, emissions and clean-up costs amounted to at least USD 3.7 trillion, which is more than India\u2019s GDP, and many times greater than the market cost.8 The lifetime cost of plastic produced in 2019 Ten times greater than the market cost Note: Numbers are rounded to the nearest billion.

Source: https://www.wwf.org.au/news/blogs/the-lifecycle-of-plastics More than four decades after the introduction of the first universal recycling symbol, the plastic recycling rate still has significant room for improvement. Compared to paper (58%) and iron and steel (70\u201390%), the recycling of plastics in general, and even more so of plastic packaging, is still in its infancy, with only 14% of plastic packaging being collected for recycling.9 Consequently, turning the recycling of plastic into a \u201ccircular economy\u201d will help to build a more restorative and regenerative system, where plastic is reused as well as recycled. Adhering to the \u201ctriad of eliminate, innovate and circulate\u201d would also lead to a reduction in plastic waste by 80%, and to a cut of 20% in greenhouse gas emissions over the next two decades, while at the same time generating 700,000 additional jobs, and USD 200 billion in annual savings.10 Source: Project Mainstream analysis. This would also speed up the decoupling of plastic production from non-regenerative energy sources. 98% of annually produced single-use plastics are actually fabricated from fossil fuels.11 Over the coming decades, the demand for oil for plastics production is expected to increase even more, growing at 3.8% until 2030, and then at 3.5% to 2050, and thus at a faster pace than the overall demand for oil, which is projected to step up by only 0.5% per year.12 Between pollution, bans and waste prevention \"By 2050, single-use plastic production could account for 5-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions.12\" No matter how versatile plastic may be, and however vast the cost savings and efficiencies delivered by its application in various areas, the impact of (unmanaged) plastic waste on the environment is devastating. Projected share of global mismanaged plastic waste in 2025 Source: https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution Estimates state that plastic currently makes up 85% of marine litter,14 and that by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean, by weight, than fish.15 Other studies indicate that since the outbreak of Covid-19 approximately 8.4m tonnes of protective masks, gloves and other inadequately managed plastic waste from the pandemic entered the ocean, originating from 193 countries.16 The pathway by which plastic enters the world\u2019s oceans Estimates of global plastics entering the oceans from land-based sources in 2010 based on the pathway from primary production through to marine plastic inputs. Source: https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution In the face of these alarming scenarios, reducing plastic waste and recycling plastic mark important steps towards a stricter protection of our planet from single-use plastic waste \u2013 even more so when considering that a quarter of global plastics waste goes into incineration, and that 40% ends up in waste dumps and landfills17, literally \u201cevaporating\u201d valuable resources. Yet not every well-meant approach to recycling plastic waste is beneficial for the environment. This is particularly true for \u201cwishcycling\u201d, defined by the Collins English Dictionary18 as \u201cthe practice of putting something in a recycling bin without being certain that it is actually recyclable\u201d. In this context, a Pew Research Center survey found that more than half of Americans believe that \u201cmost types of items\u201d can be recycled.19 Sustainable packaging can be a solution \u2013 and an investment opportunity Even though it is highly desirable to establish a plastic circular economy, where plastic products are designed to be easily reused or recycled (\u201cdesign for recyclability\u201d20), while in parallel reducing the necessity for and the use of single-use plastic products, plastic recycling alone can\u2019t be a long-term solution for building a sustainable circular system. Nor would it be possible to reduce consumption enough (and thereby reduce packaging) without drastically slowing the global economy. In this context, moving from plastic to sustainable packaging would mark a great leap forward \u2013 and many corporations are already doing their part. This gives investors a way to support the drive for less wasteful consumption, and a cleaner planet. Additionally, it opens interesting angles to participate in the ever-growing market segment of compostable and biodegradable bioplastics and biopolymers made from renewable sources like corn starch, tapioca roots, chips, starch or sugarcane. Projections suggest that the global bioplastics and biopolymers market size will nearly triple, from USD 10.7 billion in 2021 to USD 29.7 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 22.7%.21 From a regional perspective, the Asia-Pacific bioplastics industry is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 12.35% in the period from 2021 to 2030.22 On a segment basis, in 2020 packaging accounted for the largest share in the bioplastics and biopolymers market in terms of value, followed by textiles and consumer goods.23 The drivers for a surging bioplastics demand The dynamic of the expansion of the global bioplastics and biopolymers market has industry-internal as well as external drivers, like stricter regulations, and taxes on or bans of single-use plastic. However, shifting consumer preference also plays its part in driving the development, production and distribution of more environmentally-friendly alternatives to conventional plastic. In a recent consumer survey by the Boston Consulting Group, almost three-quarters of 15,000 respondents (and 83% among younger generations) said they would pay more for products with environmentally-friendly packaging, and over a fifth would pay an additional 10%. 64% of respondents also said that sustainable packaging was an important factor in their purchasing decisions.24 Putting a price on sustainability Source: https://triviumpackaging.com/sustainability/2021BuyingGreenReport.pdf Driven by consumers as well as by regulations, industries are gradually favouring the production and deployment of bioplastics and biopolymers to address environmental and economic issues, and also to mitigate the continuing price pressure exercised by the rising cost of fossil fuels. In addition, advances in R&D (i.e., lower production costs and faster production processes) are also accelerating the rise of bioplastics and biopolymers as a viable alternative to conventional polymers like Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), Highdensity polyethylene (HDPE), Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) or Polypropylene (PP) and Polystyrene (PS). Finally, a growing population and rapid urbanisation \u2013 and therefore the increasing demand for sustainable alternatives to conventional plastic from end-use industries \u2013 play their part in fostering the growth of sustainable packaging solutions. Allianz Global Investors \u201cunwraps\u201d the potential of sustainable packaging innovators Allianz Global Investors identifies companies that produce compostable and/or biodegradable bioplastics and biopolymers made from 100% renewable resources like mushrooms, corn starch, potato starch and used cooking oil. Their solutions can be decisive contributions to addressing the pressing challenges arising from the production and use of conventional polymers and single-use plastic packaging, and from the devastating impact that mismanaged and nonrecycled plastic waste has on the environment. At the very least, relying on bioplastics and biopolymers could help to save billions of USD in societal and economic costs. Allianz Global Investors also continues to invest in innovators specialising in the manufacture, development and design of products made from post-consumer recycled plastic, helping to prevent billions of pounds (lbs) of plastic waste that would otherwise likely leak into inland waterways or into the ocean.

        "content": " Carbon offsets: debate to define role in net zero by Julien Girault | 06/12/2021 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Carbon offsets sparked fierce debate between policymakers and campaigners during COP26. Such discussion is vital to help fix some of the perceived flaws in a tool that will have a role to play in the net-zero drive. Key takeaways Carbon offsets allow governments and companies to offset their carbon emissions and can be mandatory or voluntary. Voluntary carbon offsets (VCOs) are booming as part of rising net zero commitments: the market is estimated to top USD 1 billion in 2021. Debate about how to strengthen offsetting ecosystems is vital amid criticism that offsets provide a licence to pollute by enabling entities to focus on cutting net \u2013 rather than gross \u2013 emissions. A rulebook for carbon markets was agreed at COP26, marking a significant step in the development of the burgeoning carbon credits industry. What are carbon offsets? Carbon offsets allow an entity to compensate for its own carbon emissions with eliminated or avoided emissions from other activities or dedicated \u201ccarbon (offset) projects\u201d. This compensation is made through carbon offset credits, with one credit relating to one metric tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)1 of emissions. Carbon offsets should not be mistaken for carbon credits, which are centralised tools for regulating the decarbonisation of high-emitting sectors. Granted by authorities, a carbon credit gives companies in certain sectors the right to emit greenhouses gases (GHGs). These credits can be traded to comply with set quotas. Today the best known and largest carbon market is the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), launched in 2005 and, which accounts for 90% of global carbon credits volumes and 40% of EU emissions (Exhibit 1). It is based on the \u201ccap and trade\u201d principle, a system for controlling carbon emissions. That said, carbon offset credits linked to emission-reducing projects \u2013 known as Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) \u2013 can also be traded on these regulated carbon markets. These are backed by UN guidelines and can be purchased by companies needing to comply with imposed carbon emissions caps. When a company voluntarily purchases carbon offsets to lower its net emissions, rather than to comply with mandatory emissions targets, these are called voluntary carbon offsets (VCOs). Exhibit 1: Breakdown of 2020 EU ETS emission volumes by sector Source: European Union Transaction Log, Bloomberg. Exhibit 2: Breakdown of main European corporate buyers of VCOs by sector Source: Forest Trends\u2019 Ecosystem Marketplace Global Carbon Markets Data Intelligence & Analytics Dashboard, 2021. Washington, DC: Forest Trends Association. Based on purchased carbon offsets\u2019 volumes. The booming market in voluntary carbon offsets Although the VCO market is still a fraction of the mandatory market in terms of traded carbon credit volumes, it is growing quickly. Many businesses that struggle to reduce emissions as quickly as they might wish or that find it tricky to outline a pathway to fully eliminate emissions are turning to VCOs to help. In 2020, the VCO and mandatory markets were worth approximately USD 500 million and USD 270 billion respectively.2 But the VCO market is expected to top USD 1 billion this year (representing approximately 300 million tonnes CO2e). This market would need to grow by at least 15 times by 2030 in order to be aligned with the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to a 1.5\u00b0C rise by 2050.3 The pace of development in the whole ecosystem for VCOs is being driven by stakeholders across the value chain \u2013 from offset project developers to certifiers, brokers and final buyers. In many cases, VCOs direct private financing to climate-action projects that would otherwise struggle to gain financing. Unlike the mandatory market, VCO markets are not subject to regulation or international agreements and are accessible to all participants. The purchasers are mostly companies that wish to report lower net emissions (Exhibit 2). What projects are used to generate voluntary carbon offsets? Carbon projects can be broadly classified in two ways. The first is \u201cpurpose\u201d, which includes projects that remove CO2 emissions directly from the atmosphere, as well as those that avoid emissions altogether. The second is \u201corigin\u201d, which includes nature or technology-based solutions. An example of a project that removes emissions through a nature-based solution is the Athna project in Alaska,4 which focuses on carbon capture through fighting deforestation. The project helps local communities to switch their source of income from selling trees to selling carbon credits from carbon-capture projects. Projects that tackle non-CO2 ozone-depleting substances such as refrigerant or aerosol gases are another example. These projects are qualified as an avoidance and technology-based solution. The level of investment for each project depends on its qualifications, with basic renewable energy projects at the lower cost end and the most technologically advanced carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects at the expensive end (Exhibit 3).

Based on purchased carbon offsets\u2019 volumes. Why are carbon offsets so divisive? During COP26, carbon offsets were a focus of debate and revived the fear from climate campaigners of interpreting Article 6 of the Paris Agreement as a mandate to develop carbon offsets further, rather than applying pressure on entities to cut back their gross emissions. The final deal agreed by governments aims to implement Article 6 as a rulebook for carbon markets, marking a significant step in the development of the burgeoning market for carbon credits by providing a consistent and transparent framework. The core principle of VCOs is so-called additionality, whereby GHG reductions must come over and above those realised by business-as-usual mitigation activities and policies for climate transition. This would be done through projects that would be uneconomic without the funding derived from carbon offset credits. Other criteria for VCOs include: Accountability \u2013 measurable and verifiable. Irrevocability \u2013 permanent impact over time Assurance of no harm \u2013 no incremental CO2e emissions over the entire value chain and no harm caused in other sustainability domains (biodiversity, social). The verification of these factors is complex and subject to interpretation, especially on additionality. Organisations verifying the criteria include Gold Standard, Climate Action Reserve, Verified Carbon Standards, and the American Carbon Registry, who all label the credits as Verified Emission Reductions (VERs). But the respective standards vary and, whereas CERs are eligible for both mandatory and voluntary markets, VERs can be used only in the voluntary market. The quality of the underlying project is a key driver of the VER credit price, but given the smaller scale of the voluntary market, pricing can be unduly influenced by speculative buyers or old and often poor-quality credits. This creates a significant pricing divergence between the voluntary and the mandatory markets, the latter largely controlled by regulators. As a result, voluntary market pricing appears to have decoupled from the real cost of the underlying projects. Recognising the problem, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has stated it is essential to have an ambitious carbon price to influence changes in practice. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) has urged caution, while the SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative) does not take voluntary offsets into account in company science-based targets for emission reductions. Lastly, there can be double-counting issues where a government wants to claim recognition for offsets that it then sells onto to another sovereign. There are benefits from appropriately priced, good quality VCOs and the role these can play in financing climate transition. But the current debate is healthy to avoid the unintended consequences of the existing structure. How to consider carbon offsets in investment Decarbonisation within an entity\u2019s own value chain is the absolute priority and starts at the level of gross emissions. As such, not only should the scale and scope of the use of carbon offsets in an entity\u2019s decarbonisation pathway be considered, but also how they impact strategic decisions. For example, is the cost of buying carbon offsets at the expense of funds that would otherwise be spent on decarbonisation, climate mitigation or adaptation? While the current data capture on the specifics around carbon offsets remains weak, we note that the topic is increasingly highlighted in climate engagement, and company management teams are under pressure to outline the scale, scope and strategy of offsets. What is the future of carbon offsets? We expect the debate around carbon offsets to persist after COP26. Collective intelligence is evolving around the climate impact from verified carbon offsets, criticism is shaping standards, and companies are being forced to formally articulate, measure and report their gross and net decarbonisation strategies. The Task Force on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets and the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative are two major initiatives to shape this market. The first will focus on the standardisation of the market, while the second will address the issue of integrity; both will touch on disclosure. COP26 is likely to further accelerate an already fast-evolving segment, especially as we approach the inclusion of Scope 3 emissions in targets. While we at Allianz Global Investors continue to consider the best avenues to capture the data around offsets, we use engagement as the primary method for understanding the scale and scope of their use by invested companies. This engagement is done either bilaterally with invested companies or through collective initiatives, including the IIGCC. Direct and gross decarbonisation remains our priority, but a refined and evolving carbon offset market has a role to play in assisting the pathway. Ultimately, for carbon offsets to have an impact by 2050, there needs to be a robust mechanism for making sure decarbonisation targets are more than just accounting adjustments.

Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested. Equities have tended to be volatile, and do not offer a fixed rate of return. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bond prices will normally decline as interest rates rise. The impact may be greater with longer-duration bonds. Credit risk reflects the issuer\u2019s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal\u2014the lower the rating, the higher the risk of default. Emerging markets may be more volatile, less liquid, less transparent, and subject to less oversight, and values may fluctuate with currency exchange rates.

Additionally, the comparatively low weight of plastic packaging contributes to energy and fuel savings, and to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from freight transport. However, the advantages of plastics have to be set against a number of drawbacks, particularly for the environment. The absence of a circular plastic economy, and the leakage of millions of tonnes of plastic material, not only contribute in large part to marine pollution, but also trigger immense economic costs, and billions of USD in negative externalities. Fostering the further development of sustainable packaging therefore not only helps to limit the volume of plastic waste, but also offers attractive opportunities to participate in a market that is predicted to show a double-digit percentage growth rate within the next five years. Key takeaways According to analysis, 95% of plastic packaging material value, equivalent to between USD 80\u2013120 billion per year, leaves the economy (in the form of waste).1 The recycling rate of plastics is only around 14%. Due to additional value losses during sorting and reprocessing, only about 5% of plastic packaging is reused for packaging, while most of the remaining 9% is used for lower-value applications.2 Nearly a third of all plastic packaging is not available for recycling.3 Plastic packaging contributes almost USD 40 billion-worth of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental damage every year.4 Expenditures arising from these post-use effects, as well as from greenhouse gas emissions caused by plastic production, amount to at least USD 40 billion annually.5 The sustainable-packaging market is expected to grow from an estimated USD 305 billion in 2020 to almost USD 470 billion in 2027.6 Load More "

        "content": " In today\u2019s volatile market, diversification may not be enough by Gregor Hirt | 14/04/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary The first part of 2022 has been a rocky period for investors, as the invasion of Ukraine came on top of an already volatile start to the year. The attack has unsettled already volatile markets, made inflation worse and accelerated a deglobalisation trend that has been apparent for some time. Investors may need a new toolkit, rather than relying on traditional approaches that previously helped in turbulent times. Key takeaways Investors face an unpredictable outlook as worries about inflation and supply chains fuel market volatility; uncertainties have been intensified by economic sanctions on Russia and global monetary policy The move away from globalisation is another driver of inflation, particularly as production is repatriated to less efficient locations, inventories expand and labour costs increase In this environment, diversifying across and within asset classes may not be sufficient; it may be time to adjust existing positions and add new approaches Consider combining commodities with other real assets to improve resiliency, or harvesting risk premia to add incremental returns Other ideas: US high yield spreads look attractive; \u201cDigital Darwinism\u201d should help certain tech companies; and the road to net zero should boost sustainable investments Volatility has dominated markets this year, fuelled by Russian armed forces\u2019 invasion of Ukraine and hawkish central bank warnings about inflation risks. The resulting economic sanctions on Russia are also having global repercussions that are making the inflation problem worse. Countries are rethinking their energy and food supply chains, and they are reassessing the currencies used for essential transactions. Sanctions have also sped up the deglobalisation trend as production sites are relocated, organisations grow more vertical, and the allocation of labour and capital becomes less efficient. As the global economy struggles to cope with these massive changes, investors should use the opportunity to reassess how they structure their portfolios. What has worked in the past for many \u2013 comprehensive diversification across and within asset classes \u2013 may not be sufficient. Rather, it may be time to actively adjust existing positions and add new approaches. These may include combining commodities with other real assets to help improve resiliency, or harvesting risk premia to add incremental returns. As globalisation wanes, geofinance is becoming critical in how the world works It\u2019s no surprise that financial markets are becoming instrumental in geopolitical struggles and vice versa \u2013 a concept frequently referred to as \u201cgeofinance\u201d. Consider how economic sanctions against Russia are having knock-on effects around the world: Russia\u2019s central bank is limiting the use of its US dollar and euro reserves. This leads to the fundamental question of whether those currencies still make sense as reserve in a central bank\u2019s balance sheet \u2013 at least in countries potentially exposed to sanctions. There are few alternatives at present, but we would expect an increased diversification of currency baskets over time and larger reserves of gold \u2013 an asset class we favour in the long term. Since it is now almost impossible to trade with Russia in US dollars, the greenback could again be challenged as the preferred global trading currency. We do not expect the US dollar to be replaced by any other currency in the coming years, but over time, more transactions will take place in what will also become trading currencies. As the US has, over decades, financed its deficit with international demand for dollars, this could lead \u2013 permanently \u2013 to higher inflation in the dollar through its devaluation and, consequently, less demand for US Treasuries by central banks. And the timing couldn\u2019t be worse for the US Treasury, with the US debt-to-GDP ratio ballooning at around 133% at the end of 2021, up 25 percentage points since the onset of the Covid-19 crisis.1 Prohibitions against doing business with Russian companies \u2013 which will lead to their eventual exclusion by major equity and fixed-income indices \u2013 could over time lead to a repricing of tail risks for countries not aligned with the West. This could become particularly problematic if we see another \u201ccold war\u201d between blocs of countries; in that case, large clusters of risks will likely emerge. Perhaps we will soon have to redefine global bonds and equities based on this new reality. Get ready: inflation may be here to stay With the globalisation trend faltering, \u201cre-regionalisation\u201d gaining traction and growing barriers to entry between trading blocs, capital and labour will be misallocated \u2013 particularly as production is repatriated to less efficient locations, inventories are expanded and labour costs increase. These inflationary trends would be serious enough on their own, but there are also other major inflationary shifts underway. Consider what is happening in the energy and agricultural supply chains. The climate transition is contributing to an inflationary commodities super-cycle When we look at the global economy, we see signs of a \u201csuper-cycle\u201d in commodities \u2013 a massive shift in production and usage that is supported by global efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Consider that fossil-fuel investment (especially in shale gas and coal) has plunged over the last few years, while the transition to \u201cgreen\u201d energy has just begun in earnest. Green technology is dependent on a different set of commodities \u2013 just think about the copper used in electric vehicles. In addition, we must recognise that while renewable energy is less polluting, it is less \u201cenergy-dense\u201d than its fossil-fuel or nuclear counterparts on a same-for-same basis. That means more energy sources will be needed to produce the same amount of energy. Before the invasion of Ukraine, we were convinced that the energy transition alone would lead to some inflationary pressures. Since then, the conflict has been a catalyst for major changes that could push inflation up even more. Consider these examples: Germany is rethinking its long-term dependence on Russian gas. The EU is discussing a EUR 200 billion package of \u201cNextGenerationEU\u201d green bonds, favouring (among other areas) renewables and green energy. France and other countries are subsidising petrol prices, which indirectly supports demand etc. Above all, a full boycott of Russian gas imports \u2013 which we believe is increasingly likely \u2013 would worsen the inflationary gas price shock. Shifts in the agricultural system are inflationary In parallel, the drop in production of agricultural goods \u2013 especially Ukrainian wheat \u2013 has already led to rising food prices, and more increases are in store. This will be untenable for already exposed countries like Egypt, Nigeria or even Turkey, and we could even see a growing risk of civil unrest in certain parts of the world. Of course, those production cuts will be at least partly compensated for by production rises or substitutions elsewhere. But in the EU and other regions close to Russia, the fertilisers that help increase productivity are mainly produced thanks to Russian gas. A less-productive agricultural system therefore likely means higher food prices in the medium term \u2013 and related commodity prices have already risen significantly (see Exhibit 1). Exhibit 1: in recent months, the price of gas, wheat and potash (used in fertiliser) has jumped Price of Chicago wheat, European natural gas and Brazil potash (2015-2022) Source: Bloomberg. Data as at 12 April 2022. So the world is facing the real risk that there will be a further rise not only in inflation, but in inflation expectations. Similar environments in the past have led to a vicious inflationary cycle \u2013 something central banks want to avoid at all costs. It is therefore not surprising that the US Federal Reserve threatens to use the \u201cbig bazooka\u201d \u2013 50-basis-point hikes \u2013 to cool down the US economy. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank has clearly stated, despite the risk of an economic slowdown, that it would use a more hawkish approach, emphasising the focus on maintaining its credibility in the fight against inflation. What should investors do? Consider using the next bond-market correction to buy back positions We think interest rates could rise even further than expected in the next month, especially in Europe. Meanwhile, we expect the US bond market to bounce back over the next 12 months, after many years of overvaluation (see Exhibit 2). This offers some perspective. While our Multi Asset expert group has moved from a strong overweight to an overall underweight in fixed income this year, we would certainly capture the next bond correction to start building back some positions. Exhibit 2: powered by rising inflation, the recent jump in short-term Treasuries was among the highest in decades Six-month change in 2-year US Treasury rates (1985-2022) Source:Bloomberg. Data as at March 2022. Keep a close eye on equity markets The reaction of equity markets remains puzzling to us. Many ingredients are on hand for lower markets and yet retail investors don\u2019t yet seem to have the same view: Valuations remain high. Rising wages and energy costs are eating slowly but surely into companies\u2019 margins. There is tremendous uncertainty about production chains. The consumption pattern is a drag on growth. Central banks\u2019 hawkishness is set to reduce \u201cfree cash\u201d. Could it be that investors are still pursuing a \u201cbuy-the-dip\u201d strategy, which indeed worked well in past years? Or are we seeing primarily a reallocation from bonds to equities, as the latter offers a better inflation hedge, being a real asset? From our Multi Asset perspective, volatility looks set to remain high, so before we move back to a positive stance, real rates will need to come down and valuations will need to adjust. Critically, we see early signs of earnings pressure. The Allianz Global Investors Systematic Strategies team uses artificial intelligence-powered software to analyse the wording in broker reports on companies around the world, and they have seen a notable downward trend in sentiment (see Exhibit 3). Exhibit 3: broker research reports have grown increasingly negative about companies globally AllianzGI's proprietary broker sentiment score by region (Jan-Apr 2022) Source: Allianz Global Investors. Data at of April 2022. The euro zone is the primary region we\u2019re concerned about In terms of regions, we are especially worried about the euro zone. In its benchmark index (the Euro Stoxx 50), there are no large technology companies that have the same pricing power as their US counterparts do. Moreover, Europe has fewer \u201coligopolistic\u201d companies and a high dependency on energy. The UK offers much better protection thanks to its exposure to a barbell of defensive healthcare and energy. Emerging markets, on the other hand, are more complex: commodity importers will continue to suffer, especially if the US dollar remains solid, while exporters will obviously profit. China has elections approaching, so we expect to see more fiscal and monetary support for its economy, in addition to more conciliatory tones towards trade with the US and a more moderate approach to regulation. However, China\u2019s \u201czero-Covid\u201d strategy could be severely tested by the new Omicron variant, turning it into a Damocles sword hanging over China\u2019s recovery prospects. Commodities can be helpful additions to portfolios If equities as an asset class can be classified as \u201ccautiously negative\u201d and bonds may still not yet be an opportunity, what do we have left? Commodities, via direct or indirect investment, represent a great diversifier. The commodities super-cycle, the lack of supply and their overall ability to be an inflation hedge favour commodities as an asset class. The only real downside we see for now is that liquidity risks could provoke more volatility when key players \u2013 asset managers and intermediaries - exit the market. Combining commodities with other real assets (such as real estate, inflation-linked bonds, etc) may be able to help make portfolios more resilient while still allowing for exposure to equity markets. Consider strategies that harvest risk premia or target modest absolute returns This is an attractive environment for investors looking to take advantage of volatility premia. The spikes will continue to offer attractive entry points to profit from the spread implied over realised volatility, a strategy that has been successful in the long term. But such a strategy needs to be actively managed. A strategy that targets risk premia or seeks to moderate absolute return may suddenly start attracting investors\u2019 attention, despite having so much difficulty during the booming years of equity and bonds. After all, in Europe at least, cash rates are still deeply in negative territory. In that environment, a steady 2%-3% nominal yield suddenly looks perfectly acceptable as a portfolio stabiliser. Three specific opportunities At current spreads, US high yield start looking attractive especially if one does not expect a major recession in 2023. The concept of \u201cDigital Darwinism\u201d \u2013 amid a new \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d digital era \u2013 seems set to accelerate, putting certain tech and big data companies in high demand. The road to \u201cnet-zero\u201d carbon emissions will continue to attract flows into sustainable investments in both liquid and private markets. This is especially true as European regulators enact MiFID II \u2013 a massive set of new financial regulations that seem likely to be copied by global regulators in one version or another. As the West reassesses its relationship with Russia, inflationary pressures mount and central banks try to engineer a soft landing, investors will want to stay open to new ideas. Traditional diversification can be helpful during normal times, but the global economy has entered uncharted new territory. Investors will want to be flexible, nimble and active in the coming months. 1 Source: IMF. Data as at December 2021. Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against losses.

Could that be about to change? A recent uptick in performance reminded investors what they are missing, and the market could offer growth and value opportunities. Key takeaways UK equities have fallen out of favour with investors, but a recent improvement in performance underscores the long-term investment case and could prompt inflows to return Many UK stocks appear undervalued, with companies trading at significant discounts to their equivalents overseas The UK\u2019s culture of strong governance provides a transparent environment where factors that may cause a company to underperform are more likely to be addressed and rectified Over recent years, active managers of UK equity-focused strategies have proven more likely to outperform the benchmark than their peers in global equity markets, demonstrating the opportunities that the UK may offer Is the \u201cMade in the UK\u201d label about to regain its lustre? The popularity of UK equities has declined in recent years \u2013 a trend that was established before the Brexit vote and accelerated after the UK\u2019s separation from the European Union. Globally, many pension and sovereign wealth funds have reduced their exposure to the UK, in some cases to zero. But recent months have seen performance improve and investors who shunned the UK equity markets may have been caught out. While the recent political turbulence in the UK has made headlines around the world, it could be worth looking beyond the noise and taking a fresh look at the opportunities of this neglected market. Access to global businesses \u2013 at a discount UK equities represent a sizeable market, accounting for around 4% of the MSCI All Countries World Index by volume.1 That measure makes it the largest market in Europe, roughly equivalent in size to China\u2019s equity markets. Valuations across the UK market currently appear cheap compared with the rest of the world, in particular Europe and the US. The difference between average valuations of UK and European stocks has grown since the 2016 referendum and has continued to widen, even as the dual threats of Brexit and Covid-19 have receded. As Exhibit 1 shows, the UK\u2019s value discount against Europe stood at a 40-year low at the end of 2021. The gap has narrowed slightly so far in 2022, but the UK still looks attractive. Exhibit 1: UK vs Europe average valuation premium Source: Morgan Stanley as at 2 March 2022 (includes sources from MSCI, IBES). Average valuation premium between MSCI UK and MSCI Europe ex-UK indices, based on price/earnings, price-to-book value and price/dividends ratios. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results Many of the companies in the FTSE 100 \u2013 an index of the UK\u2019s largest 100 listed companies by market capitalisation \u2013 conduct most of their business outside the UK. Around 70% of revenue from FTSE 100 firms comes from overseas trade, compared with 29% for S&P 500 companies in the US.2 This means that the fortunes of UK large caps do not necessarily reflect the UK economy. A key advantage resulting from the lack of correlation is that investors can access what are, in effect, global businesses, but at the significant discount that comes with the low valuations currently seen in the UK. Growth opportunities \u2013 and dividends too As well as the giants of the FTSE 100 index, smaller firms in the UK are also currently trading at similarly low valuations \u2013 and can offer growth opportunities as well. UK small- and mid-cap businesses are more likely to be domestically focused. As a result, they are more likely to have their fortunes tied to the UK economy, which is forecast to grow quicker than most of the developed world this year, coming out of the pandemic. There is potentially some pent-up demand still to be satisfied, due to the cumulative effects of several years of Brexit uncertainty on investment and consumption, as well as the disruption during the pandemic. Many of the most promising small- and mid-cap companies come from innovative tech-based sectors. The UK is home to a burgeoning fintech industry, and the government has invested heavily in preserving the country\u2019s status as the centre of biotech in Europe. As such, the small and mid-cap sectors are home to some high-growth businesses. What\u2019s more, the potential growth companies in these sectors also often offer value, typically being priced cheaper than equivalents in the US. UK equities are also typically more likely than stocks in other regions to provide regular dividend payments. As Exhibit 2 shows, the majority of FTSE 100 companies have continued to provide a steady and reliable stream of dividend payments each year. Even in 2020, in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, three-quarters of firms paid a dividend to investors. In today\u2019s persistent low-yield environment, dividends can prove a useful source of income. More opportunities for active investors The UK market is sizeable and diverse. Across the growth and value companies available, history shows that UK equities can offer particularly rich pickings for active stockpickers. S&P Dow Jones data suggest that almost 60% of active managers running strategies in the S&P UK BMI index outperformed the benchmark over the five years to June 2021. For context, the equivalent figures for active managers in the S&P Global 1200 index (covering global equities) stood at 12%.3 Exhibit 2: Number of FTSE companies which paid dividends in the years 2001 \u2013 2021 Source: Datastream, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 3 December 2021. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. Strong governance gets our vote The UK has a global reputation for its high standards of corporate governance. Our proxy voting figures are one indicator of this: as Exhibit 3 shows, AllianzGI voted against only around 4% of company proposals in the UK during 2021, compared with around 10-20% of proposals in EU member states \u2014 peaking at 32% in Italy \u2013 and 40% in the US. This tends to show that UK companies generally uphold the highest governance standards and require less intervention on the part of investors. This strong record of corporate governance contributes to a relatively open and transparent market \u2013 corporate boards are more likely to address any factors contributing to failings or underperformance. Exhibit 3: Allianz Global Investors\u2019 total percentage votes against all proposals by location in 2021 Source: Allianz Global Investors Divergence after Brexit? There is speculation that the UK will take advantage of Brexit to diverge in terms of its regulatory standards. As an EU member, the UK was a leader in defining the continent\u2019s governance framework so \u2013 whatever happens \u2013 we expect it to maintain the same high standards of governance. But the UK may choose to flex its regulatory regime. Any evolution would likely deliver a framework tailored to the UK\u2019s needs, which may enhance its capital markets. UK \u201cindependence\u201d could bear fruit Following Brexit, investors are starting to see the UK as a separate asset class to Europe. The distinction between the UK and continental Europe will be further strengthened if the UK can secure more trade deals with the rest of the world. The potential to negotiate deals on its own terms was heralded as a key advantage of leaving the European Union. Progress has been slow, but the potential for these deals remains and they could provide a further boost to UK-based firms. What\u2019s ahead? Recent UK news flow has been dominated by speculation about the future of Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government. Overall, however, the country represents a low level of political risk. Even the opposition parties are centrist in their approach and would likely continue a non-interventionist policy towards the stockmarket if they came to power. In summary, the UK offers a broad, diverse equity market, with cheap valuations available to active investors. With promising growth companies and undervalued large caps, it adds up to a strong long-term case for investment. UK equities may have fallen out of favour with many investors over the past decade or so, but recent performance will not have escaped notice, and we expect investment in the UK to return.

The attack has unsettled already volatile markets, made inflation worse and accelerated a deglobalisation trend that has been apparent for some time. Investors may need a new toolkit, rather than relying on traditional approaches that previously helped in turbulent times. Key takeaways Investors face an unpredictable outlook as worries about inflation and supply chains fuel market volatility; uncertainties have been intensified by economic sanctions on Russia and global monetary policy The move away from globalisation is another driver of inflation, particularly as production is repatriated to less efficient locations, inventories expand and labour costs increase In this environment, diversifying across and within asset classes may not be sufficient; it may be time to adjust existing positions and add new approaches Consider combining commodities with other real assets to improve resiliency, or harvesting risk premia to add incremental returns Other ideas: US high yield spreads look attractive; \u201cDigital Darwinism\u201d should help certain tech companies; and the road to net zero should boost sustainable investments Load More "

        "content": " Embracing Disruption How do recent events in Europe affect the opportunities in transitional energy? by Julien Girault | 17/03/2022 Summary The invasion of Ukraine by Russian armed forces has destabilised security in Europe, creating a humanitarian crisis and market turmoil. With half of Europe\u2019s oil and 30% to 40% of its gas imported from Russia, the invasion has escalated concerns over what Europe\u2019s existing and long-term energy mix will look like in providing the region with dependable, affordable and climate-friendly access to energy. Here, we look at some considerations for investors assessing the energy market. Key takeaways The implications of the current crisis extend beyond fossil fuels into renewable energy and climate solutions Europe needs to remedy the significant underinvestment in energy infrastructure to counter a risk of sustained energy poverty The decline in fossil fuel use is likely to be slower, so opportunities exist in carbon capture and energy storage solutions, energy efficiency technologies and local sourcing of strategic metals and minerals In recent decades, Europe has grown highly dependent on Russian oil and natural gas, and the invasion of Ukraine by Russian armed forces has put Europe in a difficult position. The price of energy has soared even as Europe feels growing pressure to increase economic sanctions against Russia. This has reignited a discussion about Europe\u2019s energy mix, the impact of rising costs and how to make a faster transition to clean energy. The energy mix: Europe has been grappling with a sustained, widening gap between its investment in energy infrastructure and its dependence on energy \u2013 a trend that is replicated globally (see Exhibits 1 and 2). Since 1990, Europe\u2019s total energy supply has contracted overall. And while its dependence on coal, oil and natural gas has fallen from 84% to 71% since 1990, its use of gas has risen from 20% to 26%. The impact of rising costs: Given the disruptions to the supply chain caused by events in Ukraine, the impact on energy pricing is already very evident. At current price levels, it is now cheaper for many power stations to burn coal than gas. And costs aside, to maintain current energy levels while burning less Russian gas, it may be necessary to burn more coal \u2013 hardly a sustainable proposition. Investing in clean energy: Given this backdrop, European governments are under pressure to increase the use of clean energy and accelerate the delivery of green technologies. They are also assessing where nuclear power stands in the long-term energy mix, and they are looking to invest in carbon capture technologies to compensate for slow progress in reducing carbon emissions. How Europe plans to speed up the transition to clean energy Rising energy costs are making the already politically charged topic of energy even more political. Policymakers must find a balance between making energy affordable in the near term and investing in alternative energy sources over the long term. The European Commission has already commented that \u201cterminating our dangerous overdependence on fossil fuels from Russia can be achieved well before 2030\u201d. But getting there may involve acting on several fronts. Reclassifying nuclear as \u201cgreen\u201d. Nuclear power\u2019s contribution to Europe\u2019s energy mix has risen only marginally in the last 30 years, to 12.5% in 2019. The European Commission had already approved draft rules for classifying nuclear (along with gas) as \u201cgreen\u201d in the EU taxonomy \u2013 a classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities. However, the greater acceptance of nuclear as a possible core clean-energy source (albeit with waste-disposal issues) was put to the test with the shelling of Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant by Russian armed forces. Expanding renewable energy sources. Europe\u2019s renewable energy expansion appears on track, but will need to accelerate to respond to the current crisis. Its contribution to the European mix reached 22.1% in 20201 compared with only 4.3% in 19902. The European Union has targets of 32% and 60% market share for renewables for 2030 and 2050, respectively. Investing in \u201cclean tech\u201d. An ambitious pathway to achieving \u201cnet-zero\u201d carbon emissions by 2050 includes the significant expansion of renewable energy sources, increased carbon capture technologies and better energy storage. What it may mean for investors Clean tech is evolving rapidly \u2013 and needs investment Even before the situation in Ukraine brought energy issues to the fore, clean-tech investments were already a critical solution for the climate crisis. Companies that help enable both climate mitigation and adaptation may benefit significantly from Europe\u2019s energy transition. This includes firms that work on rapidly evolving technologies like energy storage, green and blue hydrogen, and grid technology, as well as more mainstream forms of renewables eg, solar and wind. Be mindful of shrinking availability of \u201crare earths\u201d and other raw materials The current crisis touches upon the access to key strategic metals and minerals required for the production of renewable energy solutions. Rare-earth elements are essential for capturing wind power; magnesium is a key component of fuel cells, plus wind and photovoltaic technology; and cobalt and natural graphite are critical for batteries and fuel-cell technology. China and Russia are responsible for most of the EU\u2019s imports of these metals and minerals. As such, given ongoing geopolitical tensions, it is difficult to ignore the scope for supply chain disruption. At the same time, as prices rise for these raw materials, previously shuttered mines outside of Russia and China may be able to restart and profitably provide local sourcing. This is a longer-term change, but it could significantly improve the scope for renewable energy development. Look into carbon-capture solutions During our AllianzGI 2021 Sustainability Days conference, we heard from Professor Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, a director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and one of the world\u2019s most influential Earth scientists. Professor Rockstr\u00f6m highlighted the importance of \u201ccarbon sinks\u201d to achieving net zero. (Carbon sinks are natural or human-made systems that can trap and store carbon emissions.) This is where the opportunity sits in carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) solutions and technologies and energy storage. According to recent International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates: CCUS facilities in operation more than tripled between 2010-2021, with the ability to capture 43.7 million tonnes of CO2. Global CO2 emission reductions from CCUS retrofits in power generation and heavy industries could reach more than 2 gigatonnes CO2 annually by 2050. The global CCUS market was estimated at USD 1.9 billion in 2020, with the capacity to grow to USD 7 billion by 2030. The current crisis has raised risks to energy security, affordability and the expansion of renewable energy sources. But it has also highlighted the necessity for accelerated investment in the European \u2013 and indeed global \u2013 energy infrastructure and mix, which provides a breadth and depth of opportunities. These extend across carbon capture and energy storage solutions, energy efficiency technologies, and local sourcing of strategic metals and minerals. Many solutions exist but need investment to achieve scalability \u2013 the growth opportunities are significant.

Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested. Equities have tended to be volatile, and do not offer a fixed rate of return. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bond prices will normally decline as interest rates rise. The impact may be greater with longer-duration bonds. Credit risk reflects the issuer\u2019s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal\u2014the lower the rating, the higher the risk of default. Emerging markets may be more volatile, less liquid, less transparent, and subject to less oversight, and values may fluctuate with currency exchange rates.

        "content": " Look for active opportunities following the Fed\u2019s hawkish move by Gregor Hirt , Martin Hochstein, CFA | 16/03/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary The US Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate against a backdrop of high inflation and concerns about the geopolitical situation stemming from events in Ukraine. While markets have previously taken rate-hike cycles in their stride, this time could be different, as the Fed seems to be more hawkish than initially expected. Investors should actively seek out relative-return opportunities. Key takeaways The move by the US Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points was no surprise, but it comes amid the most challenging environment of any cycle kick-off since the mid-1980s Our base-case view is for a steady tightening of monetary policy by the Fed until broader financial conditions have reached a sufficiently restrictive level to tackle medium-term upside risks to inflation This environment calls for a cautious approach by investors, as we potentially enter a period of broad-based disappointing asset returns Identifying the increasing number of relative-return opportunities, rather than \u201cbuying the dips\u201d, will be key for active investors What\u2019s happened At its 15-16 March meeting, the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the federal funds target rate by 25 basis points, bringing the target range to 0.25%-0.50%. This is expected to be the first in a series of hikes that could take short-term interest rates above the neutral rate of 2.4%. (The median \u201cdot plot\u201d projections of participants indicate a fed funds rate of 2.8% by the end of 2023.) The Federal Reserve\u2019s focus is on rising inflation, higher energy prices and a tight labour market as it attempts to keep the US economy from overheating and prevent a de-anchoring of long-term inflation expectations. But the US central bank is taking nothing for granted: it has said it \u201cwill be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy ... if risks emerge\u201d. What it means The Fed\u2019s monetary policy has been exceptionally accommodative for years and, by not raising rates fast enough to stay ahead of inflation, the Fed has fallen significantly \u201cbehind the curve\u201d. Yet this rate-hike cycle is starting amid the most challenging environment of any cycle kick-off since the mid-1980s: CPI is at a 40-year high: 7.9% now* vs an average of 2.3% at the start of the six Fed rate-hike cycles since 1986. The unemployment rate is at 3.8% now vs 5.7%. The output gap is already positive, while it has previously been, on average, negative. Today\u2019s long-term real interest rates are at a deeply negative level, compared with positive real rates in all six previous cycles since 1986. With its inflation-fighting credentials at stake, the Fed has no choice but to embark on a long journey towards a tighter policy stance. Central banks cannot afford to take a lenient stance on inflation \u2013 even against the current backdrop of rising geopolitical risks (which, in the Fed\u2019s view, \u201ccreate additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity\u201d), low visibility and slowing economic growth. Moreover, the latest spike in energy and commodity prices represents a supply shock on top of already high inflation rates, and it is likely to weigh on real incomes and dampen economic activity. When implementing the necessary monetary tightening to tackle upside inflation risks, the Fed aims for a \u201csoft landing\u201d of the US economy. But when looking back at history, the odds for such an outcome appear rather slim. Four of the last five rate-hike cycles in the US were ultimately followed by a recession. Our base-case view, which seems confirmed by the Fed\u2019s 16 March statement, is for a steady tightening of monetary policy by the Fed until broader financial conditions have reached a sufficiently restrictive level to tackle medium-term upside risks to inflation. This process might be disrupted, however, if financial stability or recession risks escalate along the way. What investors should do Consider the US and UK over the euro zone The Fed had done much to prepare market participants for its latest rate decision, which explains the relatively muted equity-market reaction. Indeed, the evolution of the situation in Ukraine is more important for investors\u2019 short-term risk appetite. The longer it takes to find a negotiated solution, the more uncertainty will persist around potential impacts on global inflation through supply-chain disruptions and rising energy and agricultural prices. This also explains why we continue to have a tactical preference for the US and UK over euro-zone equities, despite more attractive valuation levels for the latter. Investors will continue to favour the relatively \u201csafer\u201d US market in US dollars and the commodity-heavy UK market, while the euro zone\u2019s growth and inflation prospects are more negatively impacted by higher energy prices. Stay wary of the bond markets Overall, an environment of moderately higher inflation tends to favour equities over bonds, even though inflation rates over 5%-6% historically penalise the equity market. The bond market could remain under pressure as it exhibits some unattractive risk premia, coupled with outflows indicating that investors are starting to question its diversification characteristics. The Fed is set to continue raising its leading interest rates \u2013 perhaps even above its neutral rate \u2013 while also soon moving to quantitative tightening \u201cat a next meeting\u201d. As such, we expect a further rise at the long end of the US yield curve, even though the immediate reaction should be for a flatter yield curve as the short end reacts more than the longer end. Yields in the euro zone are also set to rise, especially once the situation in Ukraine improves, since the European Central Bank is adhering strictly to its key target of maintaining inflation at 2%. Adopt a granular view in credit Do opportunities exist in the credit markets where spreads have widened recently? US high-yield bonds look the most promising area as yield differentials with government bonds have become attractive, especially if one expects only \u201cslowflation\u201d and not stagflation in the US. However, the view of our Multi Asset expert group is that it would take a reduction in volatility to spur us to re-enter the asset class \u2013 something we do not expect in the coming weeks. The same is true for emerging-market debt. Here, a granular view is vital: some countries will profit from higher energy prices while others could come under tremendous pressure. This is particularly true for countries already made fragile by the Covid-19 pandemic, thanks to the combination of a higher US dollar and spiking import and commodity prices (especially for agriculture goods) \u2013 a volatile mix that could lead to civil unrest. Prioritise value From a style perspective, this is certainly a market in which value \u2013 especially quality value \u2013 should continue to outperform growth. Historically, value has outperformed in environments of rising inflation, while the actual valuation differential strongly favours value versus growth. Be more active on a relative basis in equities On equities, our Multi Asset expert group maintains our \u201cneutral minus\u201d view in the short term, whereby we expect markets to move sideways with a risk to the downside. The more hawkish Fed action confirmed this view. We would therefore avoid \u201cbuying the dips\u201d for the time being and instead become much more active on a relative basis. In the medium term, we have open questions with regards to the path of equity-market performance. True, markets have typically taken previous rate-hike cycles in their stride. But there have been exceptions, including extended periods when investors were unrewarded for taking market (beta) exposure. We continue to see risks of another such period with broad-based disappointing asset returns explained by: A low starting point for nominal/real interest rates and subdued risk premia in several asset classes. The risk that the Fed may condone a \u201creverse portfolio effect\u201d to get prompt traction on broader financial conditions. Tightening into slower growth, which raises medium-term stagflation risks. Today\u2019s geopolitical volatility causing underestimated, far-reaching economic and financial market repercussions. The good news is that while the absolute-return backdrop is challenging, there will be an increasing number of relative-return opportunities for active investors. Agility will be key in this environment. US headline CPI is much higher this time around than it has been in previous rate-hike cycles CPI: current vs average of previous 6 cycles (1986 to 2018) Source: Bloomberg. Data as at 28 February 2022. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Dates of previous six Fed rate-hike cycles: 16 December 1986 to 04 September 1987; 29 March 1988 to 24 February 1989; 04 February 1994 to 01 February 1995; 30 June 1999 to 16 May 2000; 30 June 2004 to 29 June 2006; 16 December 2015 to 19 December 2018. Key terms to know Behind the curve: term used to describe when central banks do not raise interest rates fast enough to head off inflation. CPI (consumer price index): usually refers to headline CPI, also known as headline inflation. This is a key inflation metric for the US and UK, among other regions. Refers to the full hypothetical \u201cbasket\u201d of goods and services vs core CPI/core inflation. Because headline inflation is volatile, it is considered not very predictive over the short term. Fed funds target rate: the range of short-term interest rate at which banks lend to each other. Loose/easy monetary policy: economic shorthand for how central banks expand the supply of money (via low rates, asset purchases and more) to stimulate economic growth. Also known as expansionary or accommodative monetary policy. The inverse of \u201ctight\u201d monetary policy. Output gap: a measure of the amount of economic slack that can be absorbed without generating too much inflation. Quantitative easing: term used to describe central banks\u2019 purchases of bonds and other securities \u2013 a process that is intended to suppress longer-term interest rates by driving up the prices of those securities (yields fall when prices rise). The opposite of quantitative tightening. Rate-hike cycle: period of time when the Fed (or other central banks) have raised short-term interest rates, measured from the first hike to the last. Real: after inflation is factored in (as in real yields, real growth rate, etc). Reverse portfolio effect: orderly upward shift of the entire risk premium curve. Risk premia: the four key risk premia for nominal government bonds are the real risk-free rate of return, the real term premium, the expected inflation rate and the inflation risk premium. Soft landing: used to describe how central banks raise interest rates just enough to slow economic growth without causing a recession. Stagflation: a period of high inflation, slow economic growth and high unemployment. * Source: CPI data at 28 February 2022. Investing involves risk.

With half of Europe\u2019s oil and 30% to 40% of its gas imported from Russia, the invasion has escalated concerns over what Europe\u2019s existing and long-term energy mix will look like in providing the region with dependable, affordable and climate-friendly access to energy. Here, we look at some considerations for investors assessing the energy market. Key takeaways The implications of the current crisis extend beyond fossil fuels into renewable energy and climate solutions Europe needs to remedy the significant underinvestment in energy infrastructure to counter a risk of sustained energy poverty The decline in fossil fuel use is likely to be slower, so opportunities exist in carbon capture and energy storage solutions, energy efficiency technologies and local sourcing of strategic metals and minerals Load More "

        "content": " Back to basics for the Fed by Franck Dixmier | 11/03/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Against a backdrop of rising inflation, we expect the US Federal Reserve to announce a rate hike of 25 basis points at its March meeting. While the decision should not surprise markets, the Fed will likely emphasise its readiness to stay agile in the event of stronger or more persistent inflation. Key takeaways We do not expect any surprises from the next FOMC: the Federal Reserve should announce a rate hike of 0.25 percentage points to combat ever-higher inflation The Fed should also emphasise its willingness to remain agile, and to stand ready to raise rates more aggressively if necessary The markets should remain calm in the face of a decision for which they are largely prepared There are no surprises to be expected from the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which should announce a hike of 0.25 percentage points to the federal funds rate \u2013 its first increase since 2018. In order not to add stress to already highly volatile equity and bond markets, Fed Chair Jerome Powell clearly pre-empted the committee's decision. On 2 March, before the US House of Representatives Finance Committee1, he stated his desire to propose a 25-basis-point hike. This decision is consistent with inflation that continues to rise and may not have peaked yet. The latest inflation figures do not yet reflect the consequences of the Russian armed forces\u2019 invasion of Ukraine: In February, the consumer price index (CPI) increased by 0.8% (the January figure was 0.6%)2. Over one year, CPI accelerated by 7.9% (compared with 7.5% in January). This was the largest increase since 1982. Core CPI, excluding energy and food products, rose by 0.5% (0.6% in January), and by 6.4% over one year. The Fed\u2019s expected decision is in line with the attention the Fed pays to second-round effects on both wages and product prices: companies have gained significant pricing power, as highlighted in the latest Beige Book. A rise in rates is also consistent with a tightening labour market, which suggests that the objective of full employment has been achieved, paving the way for less accommodative monetary policy. Finally, the Fed must react to pressures on inflation expectations. Inflation break-evens on 5-year Treasuries rose to 3.5% from 3% at the start of the year, while the 5-year/5-year inflation swap is at 2.65%3. Mr Powell is also expected to emphasise his willingness to remain nimble, and to be ready to raise rates more aggressively, if necessary, with increases of more than 0.25% in the event of stronger or more persistent inflation. The Fed is going into emergency mode, after it missed its window to act in 2021 as the health crisis continued to blur visibility. Despite high uncertainty about the consequences of the invasion of Ukraine, in terms of growth and inflation, the Fed is clearly returning to promoting price stability \u2013 one of its fundamental mandates. This rate hike should not surprise the markets, which are expecting between six and seven hikes in 2022. However, we are not entering a bullish cycle that could unfold over several years. Investors understand that these will be tactical hikes linked to spiking inflation. The markets also anticipate rate cuts in 2024, in the face of a growing probability of the US economy entering a recession in the medium term. After the European Central Bank's speech on 10 March, the Fed's announcements should mark a return to fundamentals for central banks. Faced with price shocks \u2013 which affect society\u2019s most vulnerable and, importantly, can be a destabilising factor for democracies \u2013 central banks consider the fight against inflation to be essential for promoting political stability.

        "content": " Our investment outlook amid Ukraine uncertainty 03/03/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary The invasion of Ukraine has shaken financial markets, which were already navigating inflation and central bank monetary tightening risks. Investors should remain cautious yet prepared for investment opportunities that may arise. Key takeaways Investors may want to consider a defensive stance, including safe-haven assets like gold and longer-term government bonds Equity portfolios should remain diversified across both themes and styles, such as growth and value Within fixed-income portfolios, there might soon be opportunities to return to a neutral position on duration and to increase corporate credit risk This article is a summary of insights from our 1 March webcast on the Russian forces\u2019 invasion of Ukraine. Russian armed forces\u2019 invasion of Ukraine has added a level of geopolitical uncertainty to financial markets not seen since the second world war. Investors should stay defensive while also being positioned for opportunities the market volatility may create. While the response of markets outside Russia has been relatively modest and orderly so far, the risks are mounting. The resulting commodity price increases are effectively a tax on production \u2013 raising the possibility of stagflation1 \u2013 while the unprecedented step of excluding Russia from the financial system brings its own hazards. Markets were already facing a challenging situation even before Russian armed forces invaded Ukraine on 21 February 2022. After years of bull markets, central banks were moving to end ultra-loose monetary conditions2 and tighten policy to tackle inflation at a time when asset price valuations were high. The invasion may now delay some of the planned central bank tightening, while also raising the risk of renewed economic turmoil. \u201cWe prefer to remain defensive for now.\u201d Gregor MA Hirt, Global Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Multi-Asset, told investors during an Allianz Global Investors webcast on Ukraine on 1 March. \u201cWe had started to reduce risk in our Multi Asset Fundamental Investment Committee before the crisis, based on our expectation of stronger action by central banks. In recent weeks we have moved into further safe havens, increasing gold and \u2013 tactically, given our view on inflation \u2013 adding some longer-term government bonds. On the cyclical side, we have commodities that are adding value, both due to inflation and fears about the military aggression leading to disruption.\u201d It\u2019s often said that investors should buy on the sound of gunfire, but Mr Hirt thinks such an approach is too simplistic. For instance, it did not apply in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which drove up commodity prices and inflation in a similar way. Mr Hirt does see some opportunities emerge, though, such as US high-yield bonds, as the country\u2019s economic growth remains resilient. Back to basics in equities Within equities, Virginie Maisonneuve, Global CIO Equity, said there are several key areas of focus: How inflationary pressure will affect growth prospects and pricing power for various companies How the crisis-induced \u201csupply shock\u201d to energy and other commodities may affect a shift in competitiveness for countries and companies How Europe might accelerate its renewable-energy transformation and reconsider its energy policy within the context of national security The role of China in the global economy, given its divergent monetary policy stance as well as its geopolitical influence (eg, its relationship with Russia) \u201cIn this volatile context, and with the reduced visibility that we are seeing, we are looking at using relative price strength and weaknesses for pair trades in the portfolios,\u201d said Ms Maisonneuve. In addition, the team is actively reviewing \u201csecondary Russian exposure\u201d names \u2013 that is, companies listed outside Russia that might only have small exposure to Russia, but their share prices may have been affected disproportionately by market fear. Given the current environment, cyber-security companies are among the other opportunities to consider. The Ukraine crisis is likely to mean that the pace of rate increases by US and European central banks slows, Ms Maisonneuve noted. She expects the US Federal Reserve to tighten by 25 basis points rather than the 50 that was previously widely anticipated at its next meeting, while the European Central Bank is likely to raise rates just once in 2022 rather than twice, which had been the consensus. In this volatile environment, it\u2019s back to basics. Ms Maisonneuve believes that equity portfolios should be widely diversified across themes such as areas of technology and sustainability, as well as the styles of growth and value. In terms of growth, she asserts: \u201cYou want quality growth stocks with tangible growth, pricing power, earnings and profits.\u201d An inflection point for fixed income AllianzGI\u2019s fixed-income portfolios have been defensively positioned since the beginning of 2022, reflecting the difficulty of navigating markets at an inflection point characterised by rising inflation and tighter monetary policy, as well as the developing geopolitical crisis. With portfolios currently using just 40% of their risk budgets3, though, there is capacity to carefully add risk. \u201cHaving been underweight interest-rate duration4 last year, we've very recently moved our portfolios to be closer to neutral headline duration, and are we looking to buy in bond markets where they have priced in a lot of interest-rate rises \u2013 for example, in the US,\u201d explained Julian Le Beron, CIO Core Fixed Income. \u201cWe have been positioned quite defensively in credit as well and are close to price levels where we plan to add spread risk to our portfolios, whether that's investment-grade credit or high yield.\u201d Emerging-market bond indices needed to be carefully watched, said Mr Le Beron, in case any index providers move to drop Russia from their benchmarks. If they do, investors will have to decide what to do with any holdings of Russian bonds in an environment of thin trading liquidity. The potential reaction of central banks to higher inflation and the coming squeeze on real incomes, also needed to be taken into account, said Mr Le Beron. \u201cWe believe that the Fed will be forced to raise interest rates to address the short-term inflationary pressures, which means that the yield curve could flatten as the risks of the policy error grow,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe're concerned about the growth outlook on a more medium-term perspective. That's one of the reasons why we've been looking to move back towards a neutral position on interest-rate duration, given these concerns about growth.\u201d Such shifts in investment portfolios may need to be considered by investors seeking out opportunities amid the market volatility. But their overall approach should remain defensive in the short term.

Also known as expansionary or accommodative monetary policy. 3 Risk budgets aim to distribute the risk of a portfolio among various asset classes with the objective of maximising total portfolio returns while minimising the total portfolio risk. 4 Duration is a measure of a bond\u2018s interest rate risk. In general, the longer the duration of a bond, the more sensitive it is to interest rate changes. Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested. Equities have tended to be volatile, and do not offer a fixed rate of return. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bond prices will normally decline as interest rates rise. The impact may be greater with longer-duration bonds. Credit risk reflects the issuer\u2019s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal\u2014the lower the rating, the higher the risk of default. Emerging markets may be more volatile, less liquid, less transparent, and subject to less oversight, and values may fluctuate with currency exchange rates.

While the decision should not surprise markets, the Fed will likely emphasise its readiness to stay agile in the event of stronger or more persistent inflation. Key takeaways We do not expect any surprises from the next FOMC: the Federal Reserve should announce a rate hike of 0.25 percentage points to combat ever-higher inflation The Fed should also emphasise its willingness to remain agile, and to stand ready to raise rates more aggressively if necessary The markets should remain calm in the face of a decision for which they are largely prepared Load More "

Our conclusion? Underlying economic factors tend to be bigger drivers of the markets than geopolitical events \u2013 so keep a close eye on the oil price, inflation and central bank actions. Key takeaways \u201cBuy on the sound of cannons\u201d is an old investment adage that isn\u2019t supported by our research into 13 geopolitical crises Stocks have sometimes (but not always) done somewhat better after the onset of global crises, and \u201csafe\u201d assets have sold off at times, but non-crisis-related factors were the bigger drivers of performance For today\u2019s investors, inflation should remain a key concern: rising oil prices are inflationary, and central banks want to keep inflation in check We remain cautious on equities for now: the markets have enjoyed years of solid performance, and the Ukraine crisis may spur additional selloffs over the coming weeks In times like these, some investors rely on an old market adage: \u201cbuy on the sound of cannons, sell on the sound of trumpets\u201d1. But is that really a good idea? To find out, we analysed the connection between geopolitical crises and financial markets, rounding up more than a dozen moments in the not-too-distant past that have parallels with the current situation. (See below for a list.) How markets have responded to 13 recent crises In our analysis, we found no way to draw clear conclusions about the effect of global crises on stocks, bonds, commodities or currencies. There have been times when markets have bounced back emphatically, and times when they haven\u2019t.2 Notable bull markets after crisis. After the two Iraq wars, for instance, the markets performed quite well. But we think there were more significant drivers of these rebounds \u2013 notably the imminent end of a recession (1991) or the bounce-back from the tech bubble (2002-2003). Notable post-crisis drops. Markets were under massive pressure after Russia\u2019s invasion of Georgia in 2008 \u2013 but this was likely a result of the global financial crisis, not the political crisis. On many other occasions, the equity market moves were non-spectacular. Overall, and as the charts below show, stocks have \u2013 on average \u2013 tended to do somewhat better after the onset of global crises. At the same time, \u201csafe\u201d assets such as US Treasuries have \u2013 on average \u2013 historically sold off slightly, causing their yields to rise. But as we explained in the examples above, non-crisis-related factors were likely the bigger drivers of performance. This is the important conclusion we draw from the past, and it does not support the idea of \u201cbuying on the sound of cannons\u201d. Rather, investors should make their decisions to buy or sell based on the health of the overall economy and the outlook for industries and earnings. Stocks have tended to rebound after global crises \u2013 particularly after the Cold War ended S&P 500 Index performance (in %) during 13 crisis periods (see list below) Post-crisis yields have tended to rise as investors moved away from \u201csafe\u201d assets 10-year Treasury performance (in basis points) during 13 crisis periods (see list below) Source for both charts: Allianz Global Investors, Refinitiv Datastream, GFD. Calculations based on market developments around GDR (17/3/1953); Hungary (28/10/1956); Cuban crisis (10/10/1962); Czechoslovakia (21/8/1968); Poland (13/12/1981); oil crisis 1 (6/10/1973); oil crisis 2 (16/1/1979); Iraq war 1 (17/1/1991); Iraq war 2 (19/3/2003); Arab Spring in Tunisia (17/10/2010); Georgia (1/8/2008); Crimea/Ukraine (3/3/2014); US-North Korea (8/8/2017). Past performance is not indicative of future results. How the markets are reacting to the crisis in Ukraine Since the Ukraine conflict started, we haven\u2019t seen signs of outright panic \u2013 at least in the main markets. The so-called \u201cfear index\u201d \u2013 the volatility index, or VIX \u2013 is currently at about 35. This is well above its long-term average of about 20, but far from the extreme values (50+) seen in recent years. The reality is that despite how volatile markets may make investors feel, price movements have been relatively restrained since the outbreak of Ukraine-Russia hostilities. It is true that the S&P 500 has lost more than 10% of its value from its peak earlier in the year, but US equity valuations are still quite high when viewed in a historical context. Moreover, the decline in European stock markets has been less dramatic, while emerging markets \u2013 excluding Russia, of course \u2013 have not changed much. Oil prices are another story. There has been a significant rise in energy prices, with both West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude trading above USD 100 \u2013 twice as high as two years ago. This is likely to leave its mark on economic growth. In the past, a doubling of the oil price within two years has repeatedly led to a recession. Against this backdrop, it is fair to wonder if central banks, especially the US Federal Reserve, will postpone or even stop the announced normalisation of monetary policy. We doubt it, in large part because of the inflation outlook. Consider that the rise in the price of oil will likely lead to higher inflation rates than previously expected. Moreover, companies and households may continue to raise their inflation expectations in light of higher energy prices\u2013 which can actually push inflation up further. Since the end of 2021, central banks have been increasingly pointing to underlying inflationary pressures and tight labour markets. Our analyses show that while we can expect a decline in the annual change in inflation rates, inflation is very likely to remain above the Western central banks' target of 2% in the medium term. Plus, the Fed regularly points out that it wants to tighten general financial conditions, not just central bank interest rates. A gradual decline in stock prices or an increase in market interest rates for loans and corporate bonds is unlikely to change that. Against this backdrop, we remain cautious on equities for the time being. The markets have enjoyed years of solid performance, and the Ukraine crisis may spur additional selloffs over the coming weeks.

The S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged index generally considered representative of the US stockmarket. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested. Equities have tended to be volatile, and do not offer a fixed rate of return. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bond prices will normally decline as interest rates rise. The impact may be greater with longer-duration bonds. Emerging markets may be more volatile, less liquid, less transparent, and subject to less oversight, and values may fluctuate with currency exchange rates.

        "content": " Addressing executive pay in the US technology sector by David Shammai | 25/11/2021 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Listed US technology companies often continue to be run by their founders, who also retain large or majority shareholdings. This situation can lead to questions over their compensation policies. Regardless of the type of ownership, concerns are exacerbated when boards fail to read the expectations of shareholders, evidenced by poor outcomes at shareholder meetings, and this requires active investors to engage directly with the board. Key takeaways A clear alignment between management and shareholder interests is essential, irrespective of the company\u2019s ownership structure We see an increased risk that governance weaknesses in founder-controlled technology companies may lead to the adoption of compensation schemes that fall short of the alignment we seek Low level of support for the advisory vote on pay is a governance red flag and in some cases was followed by share price underperformance Executive pay controversies can harm workforce perceptions of the company, a material risk factor for technology companies facing competitive employment markets Engagement with companies can provide more detail on their compensation structures and the reasons for their adoption Where questions remain, we will continue to engage and set out our case for change This year\u2019s US AGM season threw up a growing number of cases where companies failed to win shareholder support for their advisory vote on pay. Research shows that 2.6% of AGM votes on pay went against management, up from 2.1% last year1. And many of these expressions of dissent took place at technology company AGMs. We view these instances as red flags, which in some cases were followed by share price underperformance. This is not surprising; the board\u2019s failure to read the expectations of their company\u2019s largest shareholders could be indicative of broader governance blind spots. Source: ISS Governance \u2013 2021 Proxy season review, United States compensation At Allianz Global Investors, our approach to questions around executive pay is shaped by our Global Corporate Governance Guidelines2. The fundamental premise is that the structure and level of executive pay should be designed to promote the long-term success of the company. This entails the board having a clear ongoing apprehension of the expectations of shareholders. The guidelines detail the issues we expect boards and compensation committees to consider, such as the use of share-based compensation to help align the interests of management and shareholders. We support long-term incentive plans that set demanding, multi-year targets and encourage outperformance. From governance guidelines to practice The public equity market in the US is more dominated by large institutional shareholders than other regions3. Interestingly, it also exhibits the least concentrated ownership among the OECD economies, with ownership of each company typically spread across a broader number of shareholders. This means that our policy can be readily applied to the US equity market. However, in this context the technology sector is an outlier within the US; it has emerged in recent decades and many of its companies are still run by their founders. Among more recently established technology companies that have chosen to go public, the founders often retain ownership and voting control4. In this, the technology sector differs markedly from others, where founding entrepreneurs are no longer significant shareholders in companies with previously concentrated ownership (eg, multi-generational, family-controlled businesses). Alignment in founder-run companies is not guaranteed We recognise that founders can be an integral part of a company\u2019s investment case. However, founder-run or controlled companies face a variety of corporate governance risks, ranging from skewed control and ownership structures to issues over the balance and composition of the board. One high-profile consequence can be that compensation and long-term incentive structures do not align management\u2019s interests closely enough with those of minority shareholders. Pay is not the only way to ensure an alignment of interests between management and shareholders. Another key factor is the board, which provides checks and balances to prevent abuse of power by the CEO and management and hold them accountable for performance. The effectiveness of the board is, therefore, another factor we consider when assessing executive compensation. For example, seeking to establish the robustness of the pay-setting process, we consider whether the board \u2013 and critically the compensation committee \u2013 has sufficient level of independence. We apply our Global Corporate Governance Guidelines equivalently in all cases, seeking a clear alignment between management and shareholders, irrespective of the ownership structure. Ad-hoc research provided to us recently finds variations between sub-segments of the technology sector, with some founder CEOs receiving compensation in line with peers, while in other cases there are material differences. An important consideration for us as investors is the extent to which management performance is reflected in share price performance. Our experience so far does not indicate any correlation between compensation structures and inadequate alignment of management and shareholder interests; there is no particular feature of pay in founder-managed companies which makes them more or less prone to poor alignment. There are instances of founder CEOs who choose to receive below-market pay, in some cases nil, suggesting that they see themselves primarily as shareholders in the company. In other cases, we observe that founders\u2019 pay is in line with, or sometimes well above, market rates. Hence, in situations where we have questions about the degree of alignment between management and shareholders, we may decide to engage with the board to gain a clearer understanding of the details of these compensation structures and how they reflect performance. The results of this engagement may be an overriding factor in determining whether we accept management\u2019s voting recommendations on pay. Engagement in pursuit of deeper insight A well-designed executive compensation scheme should support the alignment of management, primarily with shareholders but also with key stakeholders5. In the case of companies run by the founding individual, there tends to be a substantial or controlling shareholding. Where we question the appropriateness of compensation levels or structures, we engage with the board to better understand the rationale and long-term strategy behind compensation schemes. As an active asset manager, we are keen to differentiate between high and misaligned levels of compensation. We are comfortable supporting high levels of compensation where the company has performed well, and we consider its strategy to have positioned it positively for the long term. In our engagement, there are several areas we regularly explore to gain insights that will supplement our analysis of published corporate reports. These include: The rationale behind the compensation policy or specific Compensation Committee decisions. The alignment of executive compensation trends with those of the workforce, which can provide insights into the organisation and identify potential areas of internal friction. The board\u2019s perspective on the company\u2019s social profile. Does it have an inclusive approach to all stakeholders (eg, employees, customers, local external stakeholders)? Management responsiveness to shareholder and stakeholder views and feedback. How regular, extensive and meaningful is the outreach? Engagement in pursuit of change Should the answers to our questions highlight risk factors or areas for improvement, we would continue our dialogue to focus on these issues. Our policy clearly explains our favoured governance structures, especially in cases involving companies that have a large base of institutional investors and are run by professional managers with small shareholdings. We will engage with management teams to discuss how they could amend compensation structures to be more aligned with our guidelines. In discussing the design of long-term incentive schemes, we may encourage companies to6: Reduce reliance on share options \u2013 these can provide an asymmetrical and geared incentive versus long-term shareholdings or strategy. This means that although their value is linked with upward share price movement, their economic value grows at a faster rate than the corresponding share price growth. Additionally, while shareholders may experience loss, recipients of share options can only experience an upside. Extend performance stretch targets \u2013 high levels of compensation should not be delivered unless linked to outperformance against peers or expectations, not business-as-usual. Reduce or eliminate equity awards that are not subject to performance criteria or thresholds. Avoid judging performance over periods shorter than three years. Conclusion: we will deepen our engagement with technology companies We have identified technology as a particular segment of the US market where we believe there is scope for improved compensation structures and will continue to engage with several of our investee companies on this topic. We will use this engagement process to make clear our expectations and the basis on which we will vote in next year\u2019s AGM season.

Such discussion is vital to help fix some of the perceived flaws in a tool that will have a role to play in the net-zero drive. Key takeaways Carbon offsets allow governments and companies to offset their carbon emissions and can be mandatory or voluntary. Voluntary carbon offsets (VCOs) are booming as part of rising net zero commitments: the market is estimated to top USD 1 billion in 2021. Debate about how to strengthen offsetting ecosystems is vital amid criticism that offsets provide a licence to pollute by enabling entities to focus on cutting net \u2013 rather than gross \u2013 emissions. A rulebook for carbon markets was agreed at COP26, marking a significant step in the development of the burgeoning carbon credits industry. Load More "

An increasing (urban) population with a growing demand for food, climate change causing more extreme weather and an aging infrastructure are the main drivers for water scarcity and water stress. Water scarcity is a significant barrier to economic growth, not only in already water-scarce regions Key takeaways Physical and economic water scarcity have both drastic societal and economic effects An increasing (urban) population with a growing demand for food, climate change causing more extreme weather and an aging infrastructure are the main drivers for water scarcity and water stress Water scarcity is a significant barrier to economic growth, not only in already water-scarce regions Corporates are facing heightened risks in absence of adaptive measures or from lacking investments in addressing water risks Investments in innovators offering water-efficiency solutions can help to address water scarcity contributing to protect the world\u2019s food supply The water scarcity challenge and the cost of inaction Throughout 2021 the world was plagued with disastrous weather events, from hurricanes and flooding to unprecedented droughts. This severe weather disrupted access to clean water supply, negatively impacting the livelihoods of many communities around the world. For example, Texas experienced infrastructure failure following severe and unusual winter weather, while Taiwan experienced its worst drought in 56 years, which posed challenges for semiconductor production. Communities in Germany and China also faced challenges, as the nations were victims of life-threatening floods. While the water scarcity challenge has been worsening, these severe weather events have further highlighted the need for urgent action to address inadequate infrastructure, adapt drainage systems, and enhance water-use efficiency. Together with the mostly uncontrolled burning of agricultural and municipal waste, the combustion and evaporation of fossil fuels \u2013 mainly from power plants, industry and vehicle engines \u2013 represent the main source of polluted air. More than a billion people live in water-scarce regions, and as many as 3.5 billion could face water scarcity by 20251 Water scarcity \u2013 a definition Water scarcity refers to a physical shortage, or lack of access to renewable water supplies (economic water scarcity). This is typically tied to lack of infrastructure, or a failure to secure an adequate water supply.2 That said, wherever water demand outpaces water supply, or infrastructure is aging or lacking, a region may face the risk of water scarcity. As demand for water continues to exceed water supply, more and more of the world is likely to experience water-related challenges. For example, 20% of global GDP is already produced in regions experiencing water scarcity.3 Download full article Source: https://www.wri.org/insights/it-could-only-cost-1-gdp-solve-global-water-crises Download full infographic Water scarcity drivers Water supply disruption The increase in demand is not the only driver of water scarcity, as challenges with water supply and water infrastructure can also play a role. For example, as climate change continues to drive more extreme weather, such as severe floods or hurricanes, existing water infrastructure will be put to the test, often resulting in failures. These failures will further drive water scarcity, as freshwater resources will not be effectively distributed, and the quality of the freshwater is likely to be negatively impacted. Additionally, changing weather patterns also impact levels of precipitation, as well as the form of precipitation. For example, whether precipitation comes in the form of snow or rain determines how long the resource can be preserved, and when it can be utilised. In regions where snow is usually the dominant form, yet rain is experienced, the freshwater resource cannot be effectively preserved for use in the drier spring and summer months. An ever-growing (urban) population In parallel to water scarcity triggered by climate change, population growth is contributing to a growing water-supply demand imbalance. Additionally, as incomes rise in emerging economies, a higher disposable income will result in lifestyle changes which impact the level of water demanded. For example, as more people can afford to live middle-class lifestyles, water demand will increase to support a more water-intensive diet or overall lifestyle. Additionally, many of these populations are gravitating toward cities which are already facing water scarcity. According to research, in 2016 around 933 million urban residents globally lived in water-scarce regions. By 2050, this number could double, reaching between 1.693 and 2.373 billion (35\u201351%).4 Water use has been growing globally at more than twice the rate of population increase over the last century, and an increasing number of regions are reaching the limit at which water services can be sustainably delivered, especially in arid regions.5 Water scarcity triggers profound environmental and societal disruptions Water scarcity has far-reaching societal and policy implications. It not only puts millions of people at risk of displacement, but also triggers bloody \u201cwater wars\u201d, for example between herdsmen and crop farmers, or between users in urban and rural areas \u2013 especially during droughts, when water normally used for irrigation is diverted for urban use. This, in turn, can lead to significantly reduced agricultural output, with cascading effects on food security. Worldwide, water-related conflicts are growing6 in parallel with an intensifying water demand. According to recent estimates, by 2050 the requirement for water could increase by 55%.7 \u201cDrought is on the verge of becoming the next pandemic, and there is no vaccine to cure it.\u201d (Mami Mizutori, UN Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction) 8 While the debilitating consequences of water scarcity are commonly associated with water-scarce regions in developing countries, highly concerning water challenges have already arrived at the doors of the European continent. According to the European Commission,9 11% of the European population (equivalent to 52 million people) are living in water-scarce regions, mostly in countries in southern Europe where water stress periods can last for several months.

NASA views water scarcity as the environmental \u2018challenge of the century\u2019.10 That said, there is a glimmer of hope if the goals of the Paris agreement are met; however, global society continues to struggle to address climate change. \u201cBetween 184 and 270 million fewer people are projected to be exposed to increases in water scarcity in 2050 at about 1.5 degrees Celsius warming than at 2 degrees warming.\u201d 11 Climate change-related scenarios elaborated by the UK-based website Carbon Brief12 depict a similar and no less alarming picture of the impact of different temperature levels on the global water supply and water availability: Download full infographic The costs of inaction Scarce supplies of water also have a significant financial and economic impact. The UN has predicted that: regions suffering from water scarcity could see their growth rates decline by 6% of GDP by 2050.13 from 1998 to 2017 droughts have already impacted 1.5bn people, and cost over USD 124bn14 Corporates across all sectors are also increasingly facing financial risk from lack of investment in addressing water risks. Reports suggest that in 2020 water risks cost corporates USD 301bn, but if they had taken preventative action the cost would have been reduced to USD 55bn. As water scarcity continues to worsen, the cost of inaction is only going to increase. In addition, the costs resulting from the absence of appropriate adaptation measures put further pressure on corporates, as highlighted by an analysis of S&P Global Ratings.15 This report states that, by the year 2050, 24 large U.S. investor-owned utilities would \u201cface a heightened risk of water shortages\u201d, and it further elaborates: \u201cUtility companies can be highly exposed to water scarcity, and the materiality of this exposure is greater for water-intensive assets, like power plants, in the absence of appropriate adaptation measures.\u201d source: https://www.spglobal.com/esg/insights/corporate-physical-assets-increasingly-in-harm-s-way-as-climate-change-intensifies Download full infographic Allianz Global Investors \u2013 Delivering Sustainable Solutions As water scarcity continues to present social and financial challenges around the world, sustainable water solutions are needed even more.

How genomic sequencing scales up health innovation In 2003, the Human Genome Project (HGP) succeeded in sequencing and mapping the genome of homo sapiens. This tipping point in the Genomic revolution not only gave the birth to genomic sequencing as a new and fascinating research area, but also ushered in a new era of precision medicine and personalized treatments. \"[\u2026] it's a transformative textbook of medicine, with insights that will give health care providers immense new powers to treat, prevent and cure disease.\" (Dr. Francis S. Collins, Director, National Human Genome Research Institute, February 12, 2001).1 Since then, genomic sequencing has taken significant steps, enabling scientists to classify and characterize viral samples and thus significantly contributing to the development of vaccines in record time with the help of genome engineering tools, among other things. It is indeed undeniable how important genetic epidemiology research has been in containing the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, gene sequencing has many other important applications such as facilitating the screening for early detection and treatment of diseases. Together with other gene-editing technologies and high-precision DNA synthesis platforms, it helps to modify, delete or correct precise DNA regions and accelerate research and discovery. For example, together with other technologies like artificial intelligence, gene sequencing can have an enormous impact on clinical trials, helping to reduce failure rates and shorten the time to market for many essential drugs. Download full article Deciphering a gene\u2019s superpower \"In 2025, as many as 2 billion people could have their genomes sequenced.\" The archetypical conflict between good and evil is not only played out in cinematic settings, but also in the depth of our DNA. For a long time, geneticists focused on deciphering the code of disease-provoking genes and their variants and/or mutations. However, with the discovery of genes having the opposite, healing effect, the way was paved for the development of medication and treatments that could imitate or simulate the impact of disease-protecting genes. The discovery and \u201cre-modeling\u201d of these \u201csuperpower genes\u201d was particularly accelerated by the possibility to timely sequence the genomes of millions of participants in globally conducted studies. This joining of research capabilities enabled scientists to significantly speed up the uncovering of several protective gene variants and to create disease inhibitors with a similar protective effect like their genetic role models while also preparing the ground for precision and personalized medicine. Personalized Medicine: the blueprint for sustainable health Our genes form the foundation and basis of human health. They are key in determining, for example, if one is at an increased risk of developing certain conditions or of suffering from inherited health problems. The better we understand our unique genetic makeup the more additional valuable information we can gain. This knowledge can help to: develop and prescribe tailor-made medical care perfectly matching not only the genetic makeup but also the actual health status of an individual patient. significantly reduce potential side effects. benefit from better outcomes and a more effective treatment. predict more accurately the individual response of a given treatment. avoid taking additional tissue or blood samples develop tailor-made prevention strategies for specific diseases in accordance with the corresponding genetic disposition adapt the frequency of screenings to prevent or diagnose and treat diseases earlier. change our lifestyle meticulously guide decision-making surrounding our health through all stages of life. In the context of personalized medicine, secondary findings2 - unexpected health results from genomic testing that are not related to the originally intended examination - have proven to offer the opportunity to timely identify genomic variants that potentially or very likely point to severe though treatable diseases. Studies suggest that between 1% and 4% of people taking genomic tests get secondary findings. At the same time a lively discussion has broken out on how clinicians should discuss non-intended results from genomic testing with their patients since they are confronted with a new diagnosis and how potentially life-saving secondary findings should be used if patients refuse to receive them. \"1 in 6 healthy adults is at increased risk for a serious health condition due to their genetics\u2014and probably doesn't know it.\" 3 Despite the controversy on the (future) role of secondary genomic findings, they are a crucial part of the progress that genomics is making in helping us care for our health. ! It is putting the power in our hands to more effectively guide our treatment options \u2013 be it in cancer care, heart disease, pregnancy etc., by finding the precise method of care needed as dictated by our genes. Less cookie-cutter treatments and more tailor-made solutions can make for a more robust and effective healthcare system where the consumer feels empowered, confident, and hopeful. Knowing that physician recommendations were guided by our unique genetic makeup resulting in a personalized health plan paves the way for more sustainable health and can only continue to grow by leaps as we further our research in this area of genomics. Are the costs for genetic sequencing following Moore\u2019s Law? Following recent estimates on the cost trend for genomic sequencing, the rate of cost decline seems to not only follow but also exceed Moore\u2019s law as costs have approximately halved every two years. If this pattern is maintained, the cost per genome will soon fall below USD 1,000. Source: https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Sequencing-Human-Genome-cost, 2021 This decline in costs is contrasted by the considerable growth of the global genomics market, with forecasts predicting the segment to reach a value of USD 54.4 billion, a double-digit CAGR-growth of 19.0% by 2025.4 e = estimated | P = projected. Source: MarketsandMarkets.com The genomic sequencing market is ripe with opportunity for investors. With the rise of more viral diseases globally, the declining costs of genomics which would allow for more personalized treatments as well as significant investment from governments and companies, we will continue to see major growth. With genomic sequencing becoming less costly and more areas for application becoming more available, there will be greater and more sustainable opportunities for specialized companies. Allianz Global Investors identifies genomic sequencing innovators To further accelerate the genomic sequencing research and to widen its application areas, investments are needed.

How should bond market investors respond? Here are two more ideas. Key takeaways Higher-than-expected inflation has surprised markets in the second half of 2021, and it could be more prolonged than many expect. As inflation erodes bonds\u2019 real returns, a long-term investment strategy should seek safeguards. Two possible options are inflation-linked bonds and floating rate notes. 2021 could be remembered as the year that inflation returned. For decades inflation has stayed low globally, but in the last months of 2021, markets have experienced hotter-than-expected inflation and inflation surprises globally are at their highest level in over 20 years (see Exhibit 1). Source: Bloomberg. Is inflation structural or temporary? The coronavirus pandemic with all its consequences \u2013 like the shutdown of manufacturing production in early 2020 \u2013 brought inflation to such low levels that even comparison with the first months of 2021 shows significant variations. This is the \u201cbase effect\u201d, which tends to decrease over the following months as the terms of comparison become more homogeneous. The essential question for financial markets is whether temporary factors or structural forces have been more significant in sparking inflation\u2019s return. Temporary factors are certainly at play. They include the rising price of key raw materials, primarily oil; the strong recovery of economic growth that leads to effects known as output gaps \u2013 where the actual output of the economy may exceed its potential output; and supply disruptions. But our economists believe that financial markets may be underestimating the risk of higher inflation in the medium term. The consensus view considers the current rise in inflation to be a transitory phenomenon: a view the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and other central banks firmly support. In our view, there are good reasons to think that structural forces \u2013 factors that are permanent or sustained \u2013 could lead to stubbornly higher inflation. Changes in the labour market, especially as globalisation reverses, are pushing up the prices of goods and services. And, above all, the expansionary monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, with their adoption of flexible inflation targets, implies they may be \u201cbehind the curve\u201d \u2013 and interest rates could fail to keep pace with inflation. That said, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether the increase in inflation will be structural or more temporary, as the long-term consequences of the pandemic are still not clear. While we clearly do not expect inflation rates to return to the levels seen in the 1970s, we believe that medium-term inflation risks are higher than currently anticipated by the market. We expect inflation premiums to rise slightly and inflation volatility to increase. Two bond market options for inflationary times Should higher inflation prove to be structural, there are two options worth considering when investing in the bond markets. 1. Inflation-linked bonds Inflation-linked bonds (ILBs) are designed to protect investors from inflation as the instruments benefit from rising inflation expectations. Because their principal and interest payments are contractually linked to a recognised inflation measure such as the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) or Europe\u2019s Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), rising prices translate directly into higher coupon rates and principal values. Exhibit 2 illustrates how principals and coupon values change, from issuance to maturity. When to buy ILBs? To assess the relative attractiveness of ILBs (also known as \u201clinkers\u201d) against nominal government bonds, we refer to the so-called break-even inflation rate, which is the difference between nominal yields and real yields. In other words, it indicates the inflation expectations priced into the market, or the rate differential at which holding a nominal bond and an ILB of the same issuer and the same maturity would be equivalent. Therefore, if we expected inflation to be higher over the life of the bond than the break-even rate, we would earn a higher return holding ILBs, while at the same time having lower inflation risk. The opposite would be true if we expected inflation to be lower than the break-even rate. This means that the best market environment for investing in ILBs is when inflation is rising and markets are pricing higher inflation in the future, as they are today. This explicit link to changes in inflation makes ILBs an effective way to incorporate real returns into a portfolio. A prolonged period of declining prices, or deflation, would be a less suitable market context for investing in ILBs because the principle and coupon payments would be based on the deflationary scenario. However, to mitigate this risk, more and more ILBs are issued with a deflation floor. This guarantees that the bond\u2019s principal amount will not fall below par at maturity, so only the coupons are affected by the decline in prices. As with any other bonds, ILBs are affected by interest rate risk, or duration. Interest rate risk could prove topical if real yields move higher following a shift by central banks to a more restrictive monetary policy, as ILBs usually have long durations. To mitigate this, portfolio managers can deploy swaps to isolate and manage the pure inflation risk. 2. Floating rate notes Another area of the bond market that can outperform in inflationary environments is floating rate notes (FRNs), which have their coupons linked to a specified base rate. Floating rate coupons normally adjust around every three months: as the cashflows reset in line with interest rates, the bond price tends to remain stable around par. An everyday example could be a mortgage with monthly payments that adjust in line with a central bank\u2019s official rate. On the other side of the equation, banks and corporations issue bonds with coupons typically tied to a short-term market interest rate such as LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), or the newer interbank indices including SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) in the US and SONIA (Sterling Overnight Indexed Average) in the UK. One potential benefit of linking floating rate bonds to market-determined rates is that they tend to be responsive to inflation risks. By contrast, central bank policy often lags through inertia or a deliberate desire to support growth and employment. Exhibit 3 shows that the market rate often (though not always) moves first and further than the official central bank rate in response to changes in inflation. Investors, therefore, benefit from price stability in floating rate bonds, while gaining additional income if inflation and short-term market rates do rise. Source: Bloomberg. The floating rate coupon\u2019s premium over and above the base rate is known as the discount margin; it reflects the riskiness of the issuer and the bond itself. This margin ranges from a handful of basis points for a highly rated issue backed by prime collateral, to several percent for lower quality corporate bonds. FRNs therefore contain credit risk, in contrast to ILBs which are generally government-issued. Also, to simplify a little, FRN performance can be driven more by market views on short-term inflation, while ILBs reflect the longer-term expectations of break-even rates. As such, the performance of FRNs is linked to the business cycle and investor sentiment. Individual issues may be subject to credit downgrades or even defaults in the worst-case scenario. Conversely, when economic growth and corporate results are strong, discount margins will shrink and FRNs will perform well. Thinking about the different economic scenarios presenting themselves, FRNs tend to perform poorly in times of deflation and contracting growth \u2013 the first quarter of 2020 being a prime example. Strong growth coupled with rising inflation and short-term market rates is the best environment for FRNs, as was the case in 2004-6 or 2017-18. Stagflation \u2013 high inflation coinciding with a slowdown in economic growth \u2013 would present a mixed bag; rising rates would benefit FRNs as coupons adjusted upwards, however only higher rated and defensive issuers would perform well. More cyclical and sub-investment grade companies typically require growth to sustain their debts. It should be noted that FRNs may reduce, but not completely eliminate, interest rate risk, as there can be a lag of a few months before the coupons reset. In the asset/mortgage-backed sector, the bonds are typically secured by specific collateral or assets of the issuer (so that holders of the debt, such as the fund, have a priority claim on those assets in the event of the issuer's default or bankruptcy). The value of collateral may be insufficient to meet the issuer's obligations, and the fund's access to collateral may be limited by bankruptcy or other insolvency laws. Our investment techniques, analyses, and judgments may not produce the outcome we intend. A long-term plan to counter inflation Inflation is one of the most harmful forces that fixed-income investors face, as it erodes bonds\u2019 real returns. Consequently, a long-term investment strategy should consider protection against the risk of inflation. ILBs do not only offer a natural hedge against a rise in inflation, they are also an efficient tool for investors seeking diversification within a broader fixed income portfolio, as they tend to be less correlated to other forms of fixed income. Our expertise at Allianz Global Investors covers not only ILBs, but also a wide range of performance drivers linked to inflation, such as inflation swaps, break-even trades and active management of duration and curve positioning. Likewise, FRNs can benefit portfolios at times of rising inflation and rising short-term rates, even if central banks choose to let the economy \u201crun hot\u201d. Active management is also called for here, however, given the possibility of credit risk. To return to the current macroeconomic environment, higher inflation is back. And while consensus opinion still regards the drivers of inflation as transitory, we think it will be higher than many market-watchers expect. For this reason, it may well be time for investors to seek safeguards. Download the pdf version Investing involves risk.

Find out how increasing application areas of genomic sequencing and declining costs per genome can offer opportunities to participate in the growth prospects of precision medicine and health innovation. Key takeaways: In 2003, the Human Genome Project (HGP) completed and published the full sequence of the entire human genome, a tipping point in the Genomic revolution. Since then, genomic sequencing has gained great significance in the research and development of personalized/precision medicine, as well as other therapeutics and vaccines, contributing decisively to the understanding and mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants and to the development of vaccines in record time. Cost-effective personalized therapies facilitate the identification of patients\u2019 exact needs and the prescription of individualized medicines and treatments. Increasing application areas of genomics offer the opportunity to participate in the growth prospects of precision medicine. According to estimates, the global genomics market could reach USD 54.4 billion by 2025, driven by a double-digit growth rate during the next five years. Load More "

In part two of a two-part paper, we share the results of our proprietary analysis into the asset classes that may provide an optimal inflation hedge. Key takeaways: Given our view that inflation is set to last longer than many market watchers expect, we conducted our own analysis into how different asset classes performed in a range of inflation environments Our research found that with moderate inflation (2%-4%), equities were the top-performing asset class, and sovereign and corporate bonds both generated decent positive annual real returns Perhaps surprisingly to those who consider gold to be the ultimate hedge against inflation, gold\u2019s returns were mixed across different inflationary environments Commodities consistently generated solid positive returns in times of high and rising inflation, but their longer-term outlook may be obscured by the transition away from fossil fuels In our view, global central banks and many investors underestimate the probability that consumer price inflation may turn out higher than expected and last longer than currently priced into financial markets. While we don\u2019t foresee a return to the price environment of the 1970s, we think medium-term inflation risks are nevertheless skewed to the upside, and we may see a more regular overshooting of central banks\u2019 inflation targets over time. This is contrary to the consensus scenario (and the view of most central banks) that the rise in inflation is just a temporary phenomenon \u2013 a perspective that we think is a bit too sanguine. To learn more about the eight factors driving inflation higher, read Inflation: beyond transitory. As a result, we believe investors should take a closer look at how their portfolios are positioned to hedge against inflation. In seeking to determine some of the optimal ways to provide this hedge, we conducted our own in-depth analysis of a range of asset classes. Explore the four sections below to see the results of our findings. Expand All Collapse All Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email 1. How can inflation affect bond and equity prices? From our perspective, the conventional wisdom oversimplifies how inflation affects major asset classes \u2013 as shown in this high-level overview (see Exhibit 1). Exhibit 1: the consensus view may oversimplify the effect of inflation on major asset classes Impact of inflation Asset class Conventional wisdom Our view Why? Government bonds Inflation is a negative for government bonds Usually negative, but not alway Higher inflation isn\u2019t always a drag on performance, in particular if it\u2019s already priced into market-based inflation compensations (\u201cinflation breakeven rates\u201d). Moreover, the real risk-free rate can go down (driving bond prices up) if markets anticipate a slowdown in real GDP growth and, consequently, easier central bank rates. Corporate bonds Inflation is better for corporate bonds, but still detrimental Mixed results Corporate bonds have a complex relationship with inflation (eg, investors make assumptions about inflation\u2019s impact on corporate profits, the pricing of default risks, etc) Equities In times of inflation, equities don\u2019t perform as well as commodities Equity performance depends on the inflation level Inflation can affect equity valuations in multiple ways. Our research has shown that equities have done best in periods of moderate inflation \u2013 historically better even than commodities and gold. Source: Allianz Global Investors. The equity example in particular is worth closer examination, as there are many ways to assess the relationship between inflation and equities. According to the Gordon Growth Model, which is a simplified dividend discount model widely used to value stocks, inflation \u2013 shown below as (i) \u2013 would enter the equation in many complex ways:1 The ultimate effect on equity prices stemming from higher forecasted inflation is unclear, as inflation affects both the numerator and denominator. Obviously, a higher inflation rate can raise the discount rate via a higher inflation premium. But, again, the real risk-free rate is likely to change as well. Moreover, a higher inflation rate can also impact the expected dividend as well as the long-term earnings growth, both in nominal and real terms. For example, dividends and earnings very much depend on corporate pricing power, which itself is related to multiple factors. These include the industry in which a company operates, the difference between economic and accounting depreciation, and the origins of inflation (demand pull or cost push). In addition, the equity risk premium is likely to move \u2013 for example, if the outlook for central bank policy and inflation were to become less clear. However, many investors are not aware of the complex dynamics between bonds, equities and inflation. As a result, they rush to simple and frequently incorrect heuristics when assessing the relationship between equities and inflation surprises. It is therefore of utmost importance to also analyse the empirical data that enable us to identify typical relationships between inflation and asset prices. 2. What are the most attractive inflation hedges? We analysed more than 50 years of performance across asset classes In seeking to determine some of the optimal ways to hedge against inflation, we looked at periods when US inflation was at least 2% and rising, year over year, since this matches what we think is the most likely scenario for the near future. We analysed the year-over-year performance (in US dollars) of several asset classes \u2013 US cash, US government and corporate bonds, US and global equities, and commodities. (Note that we believe our key conclusions would likely hold true for non-US markets as well.) And we sought data going back at least 50 years, when the world entered the current fiat money system post-Bretton Woods. (Where possible, we also looked for data reaching back to 1945 \u2013 the end of the second world war.)2 The top-line findings from our research presented several surprises Based on these parameters, the key findings from our study have been presented in the following table (Exhibit 2). See the Appendix for a closer look at our findings. Exhibit 2: key findings from our research into inflation\u2019s effect on key asset classes Annual inflation level Equities Fixed income3 Commodities and gold 2%-4% Equities were the top-performing asset class (see Exhibit 3). Real returns were in double digits on average (vs long-term average of 7%) Sovereign and corporate bonds generated decent positive annual real returns (around 5% and 7% respectively) Commodities consistently generated solid positive returns in times of high and rising inflation \u2013 particularly true for energy and industrial metals Gold\u2019s returns were mixed However, as we discuss later, the outlook for commodities is being obscured by climate change and the effort to move away from fossil fuels 4%-6% Equities outperformed bonds, but absolute year-over-year returns were in low- to mid-single digits (lower than their long-term average) Bond returns were also in low- to mid-single digits 6%-8% Negative absolute returns on average \u2013 underperforming bonds Bonds outperformed equities Greater than 8% Negative absolute returns on average, though better than Treasuries and corporates Corporates performed worse than sovereigns Source: Allianz Global Investors. Exhibit 3: historically, commodities had been the best hedge against inflation \u2013 but equities also did well in moderately inflationary environments Average annual real asset returns since 1971 in times of positive inflation surprises and inflation above 2% Source: Allianz Global Investors. Other research and empirical evidence appear to back up our findings Importantly, we also found other empirical evidence that backed up our main findings from an economic perspective. Bond returns were likely to suffer in times of higher inflation rates that are perceived not to be only transitory. This is because investors will demand higher inflation compensations, as the historical data show. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that the low current yield of most fixed-income instruments today provides a weak cushion against a rise in inflation and interest rates. For equities, low- to mid-single-digit inflation rates turned out to be a critical hurdle rate for certain economic variables. It turns out that US equity valuations, based on the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, tended to be in a sweet spot at inflation rates between approximately 1.5% and 4% (see Exhibit 4). But once inflation rose further, multiples tended to fall. Exhibit 4: equity prices historically responded best when inflation was around 1.5%-4% CAPE vs inflation since 1971 Robert Shiller, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at September 2021. CAPE = cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings; CPI = Consumer Price Index. What accounts for the fact that a higher amount of inflation had a negative effect on equity valuations? Economic theory suggests that inflation above a certain level creates all kinds of distortions weighing on economic growth: The higher the inflation rate, the more private households and companies find it difficult to differentiate between absolute and relative price increases. Consequently, they may make suboptimal spending and investment decisions, which can dampen economic growth. Private households typically cannot increase their nominal income (ie, wages) in sync with rising expenditures. Consequently, real disposable income suffers from rising inflation, which can also be a drag on growth. While corporate input costs usually increase during periods of rising inflation, companies may struggle to adjust their production processes and output prices accordingly. Empirically, we found that inflation rates between 4% and 6% \u201cmoved the needle\u201d in the wrong direction. Inflation-adjusted corporate earnings growth tended to fall once inflation went beyond these levels. In the same vein, private household per capita consumption and real GDP growth suffered as well. This can help explain our other findings for the various asset classes we studied: Equities have been an imperfect hedge against inflation \u2013 not only in absolute terms, but also relative to bonds, once inflation rose to mid- to high-single-digit levels. In the same vein, corporate bonds have been inferior to sovereign bonds in times of very high inflation (which we define as greater than 8%). This may be because growth concerns take over, and investors start to price in significantly higher risk premia (spreads). The findings on commodities, admittedly, may also be dominated by the oil price shocks of the 1970s. It remains to be seen if energy prices will continue to rise structurally in a world that is moving away from fossil fuels. Gold is not an ideal inflation hedge, in our view. The gold price primarily benefits from low, if not negative real interest rates, which are the opportunity costs of holding any asset paying zero cash flows, like gold. The level of real interest rates, though, depends more on monetary policy and real economic factors \u2013 such as economic growth and the savings/investment balance \u2013 than on the inflation rate. Nevertheless, gold may be supported by growing concerns about the sustainability of the current fiat money regime, in light of ever-rising private and public debt levels and unprecedented global money supply. 3. What are the top implications for investors? Equities: based on our view of inflation, equities are a hedge worth considering While we expect inflation to surprise on the upside relative to current market expectations, we also believe it will remain far below the levels we saw in the 1970s and early 1980s. This would put the inflation rate somewhere between 2% and 4%. At that level, our research shows that equities have historically generated strong inflation-adjusted returns \u2013 better than bonds. In the end, equities are real assets and may be able to provide a solid hedge against unpleasant potential inflation surprises \u2013 notably compared with highly priced bonds. Nevertheless, we should keep in mind that US equity valuations are quite stretched already, which may dampen the return outlook. Moreover, a rise in inflation volatility, not just the inflation rate itself, also matters for equity valuations. Our long-term absolute return expectations for equities are therefore moderate. Fixed income: active managers can still seek positive returns when inflation is rising While rising inflation is one of the biggest risks for investors in nominal government bonds, there are ways for active managers to generate positive returns in such an environment. The four building blocks of nominal government bond yields are the real risk-free rate, the real term premium, the expected inflation rate and the inflation risk premium. Active fixed-income managers can seek to generate returns from positioning on changes in each of these factors using a variety of instruments. To learn more, read \u201cHow inflation can be an opportunity for active fixed-income investors\u201d by Jan Simon King, Fixed Income Product Specialist at Allianz Global Investors. Commodities: strong historical performers during inflationary environments, but climate change could affect the outlook Commodities have historically done even better than equities in most inflationary environments, but the outlook for commodities is less clear to us. Economic policy that addresses climate change could create some headwinds for energy commodities, whereas demand for industrialized metals \u2013 particularly copper, which is a highly efficient heat and energy conductor \u2013 will be reinforced by the \u201cgreen transition\u201d. Private markets: for institutional investors, a strong contender as an inflation hedge Although outside the scope of our research for this paper, institutional investors may also want to consider investing in the debt or equity of privately held companies. Private market assets can help investors hedge against \u2013 and even benefit from \u2013 a sustained return of inflation. This may be because of their long-term buy-and-hold qualities and their ability to pass on cost increases. To learn more about this unique asset class, read \u201cHow private markets can help navigate rising inflation expectations\u201d by Emmanuel Deblanc, Head of Private Markets at Allianz Global Investors. 4. Appendix: Want a closer look at four key findings from our research? First, for periods in which inflation reached between 2% and 4% year \u2013 a level that only moderately exceeds the current Federal Reserve inflation target \u2013 equity returns adjusted for inflation were, on average, in the double digits. As a result, equities outperformed all other asset classes we studied. Moreover, equity returns were substantially higher during these periods than they were over the long term, when they returned close to 7% per year. Still, both, sovereign and corporate bonds, generated decent positive annual real returns in this environment (around 5% and 7% respectively). Second, once inflation picked up to 4% to 6%, equities still outperformed bonds, but the absolute year-over-year returns of equities and bonds were in the low- to mid-single digits. In addition, equity returns were lower than their long-term average. Third, once inflation exceeded 6% per year, equities were no longer a hedge against high and rising inflation. Rather, absolute returns of equities were negative on average. Interestingly, when inflation rates were between 6% and 8% per year, equities even tended to underperform bonds. Bonds only fell in absolute terms when inflation was above 8% \u2013 and in these environments, corporate bonds performed even worse than sovereign bonds. Fourth, commodities consistently generated solid positive returns in times of high and rising inflation \u2013 meaning any periods we studied above 2%. This was particularly true for energy and industrial metals, while gold\u2019s returns were mixed. This will likely come as a surprise to the many investors who consider gold to be the ultimate hedge against inflation. However, the outlook for commodities is being obscured by climate change and the effort to move away from fossil fuels. Find out more about the eight factors driving inflation higher Download the pdf version Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested. Equities have tended to be volatile, and do not offer a fixed rate of return. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bond prices will normally decline as interest rates rise. The impact may be greater with longer-duration bonds. Credit risk reflects the issuer\u2019s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal\u2014the lower the rating, the higher the risk of default. Investments in commodities may be affected by overall market movements, changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes, and international economic and political developments.

How should bond market investors respond? Here are two more ideas. Key takeaways Higher-than-expected inflation has surprised markets in the second half of 2021, and it could be more prolonged than many expect. As inflation erodes bonds\u2019 real returns, a long-term investment strategy should seek safeguards. Two possible options are inflation-linked bonds and floating rate notes. Load More "

        "content": " Don't downsize your dreams Inflation: beyond transitory by Stefan Hofrichter, CFA , Martin Hochstein, CFA | 04/11/2021 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Inflation has made a forceful comeback recently, and we believe it will last longer than the financial markets and many investors currently anticipate. In part one of a two-part paper, we look at the factors that may cause a more persistent rise in consumer price inflation \u2013 and why it matters to investors. Key takeaways: The recent inflation spike has been amplified by several extraordinary and temporary factors \u2013 including the post-Covid rebound and base effects But there are other reasons why consumer price inflation may turn out to be \u201csticky\u201d \u2013 including continued accommodation from central banks, less globalisation and an aging population We also expect the fight against climate change and economic inequality to contribute to upward inflationary pressure The inflation spike is real \u2013 and it may last for some time After years of subdued price pressure and a brief disinflationary bout early in the Covid-19 pandemic, global inflation has made a forceful comeback. Consumer prices in OECD countries rose by 4.3% from August 2020 to August 2021 \u2013 the fastest pace in 13 years.1 But contrary to the market consensus, we believe that only part of the inflation spike is transitory. To be sure, some of the recent rise in inflation is a byproduct of the sharp post-Covid economic recovery, powered by unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus, lingering pent-up demand and surging commodity prices. The inflation spike has also been amplified by several extraordinary and temporary factors \u2013 including base effects, tax effects and supply-side bottlenecks. Yet in our view, there are cyclical and structural forces at work that could lead to a more persistent rise in goods and service inflation in the years ahead. Importantly, we believe this increase could be notably more than what the financial markets and many investors currently anticipate. We expect inflation to regularly reach and at least temporarily overshoot central banks\u2019 targets over time. That makes it worthwhile to take a deeper look at the factors that are driving inflation higher. Eight factors driving inflation higher Expand All Collapse All Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email 1. Central banks\u2019 reaction function is changing After the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, long-term inflation expectations regularly dropped below central banks\u2019 target levels due to a sluggish reflation process. Their efforts at sparking higher levels of inflation were held back by factors such as the shallow global economic recovery and after-effects from the multi decade rise in globalization. In order to address the risk of a \u201cde-anchoring\u201d of inflation expectations to the downside2 (see Exhibit 1), many central banks made adjustments to their monetary policy approach and related reaction functions \u2013 some clearly signalled and others more implicit. Some of their more reactive strategies have new names, such as the \u201cflexible average inflation targeting\u201d by the Federal Reserve or the \u201csymmetric 2% inflation target\u201d by the European Central Bank. But the shift to these new reactive strategies raises the risk of a monetary policy error, particularly when it gets late in the economic cycle. If central banks are too late in addressing the risks that may de-anchor long-term inflation expectations to the upside, they could be forced into a more aggressive and disruptive tightening of monetary policy. This could upend parts of the global economy and make inflation more volatile. It would likely also affect financial markets. Rising long-term inflation uncertainty means investors would expect to be compensated accordingly, which would lead to higher inflation risk premia. Exhibit 1: inflation expectations are on the rise US inflation expectations/compensations (since 1999) Source: Bloomberg, Philadelphia Fed, Cleveland Fed. Data as at 30 September 2021. 2. Excessive policy stimulus is threatening the independence of central banks During the Covid-19 crisis, central banks around the world stepped up their unconventional stimulus measures, buying sovereign bonds at an unprecedented pace. This massive injection of central bank liquidity led to an unparalleled surge in global money supply (see Exhibit 2) that could fan consumer price inflation over time, in particular against the backdrop of rapidly shrinking output gaps3. Critically, we don\u2019t expect this situation to reverse anytime soon. There has been a steady rise in private and public indebtedness around the world, and ultra-accommodative monetary policy has kept the financial system afloat. But the system has also come to rely on this support, leading to what has been termed \u201cfiscal and financial dominance\u201d \u2013 an environment where central banks essentially do the bidding of their governments4. To be fair, higher coordination between the monetary policy of central banks and the fiscal policy of governments was necessary to contain the immediate economic fallout of the Covid-19 crisis. But maintaining this close link for too long would effectively prevent central banks from being independent. It could also introduce some form of modern monetary theory (MMT) \u2013 which broadly describes an environment where governments would end the era of independent monetary policy by taking back full control over the printing of their fiat currency to fund spending. In either case, the rising risk of MMT and fiscal/financial dominance should be reflected in higher long-term inflation expectations and rising inflation risk premia.

Growth in the volume of international trade has slowed and protectionism is on the rise. Reduced international access to cheap labour is putting upward pressure on wages, and eventually on prices. In addition, severe disruptions in global supply chains since the outbreak of the pandemic have triggered a wave of \u201cre-shoring\u201d activities in the corporate sector5. There have also been supply shortages in the UK as a consequence of Brexit. These examples illustrate how the longer-term trend of re-regionalisation and slowbalisation are structural issues that weigh on global economic growth while pushing consumer price inflation higher.

Data as at December 2019. 4. Favourable demographics are in decline as populations age For 30-plus years, the global workforce has been growing, reinforced by globalisation and access to cheap labour. Together, these forces provided a powerful tailwind that drove output up and inflation down, but this environment is coming to an end. A progressive ageing of the world population (see Exhibit 4), rising dependency ratios (where the working-age population is shrinking as a proportion of the total population) and slower growth in labour supply in the emerging world (particularly in China) may contribute to a return of inflation in the years ahead6. The interplay between these factors is complex, but consider that as the world grows older, there will be an increase in the \u201cconsuming\u201d part of the population relative to the \u201cproductive\u201d part of the population. All else equal, prices for goods and services would rise as demand outstrips supply. Exhibit 4: demographic trends point to fewer workers, which could push up wages Working-age population (1955-2100) Source: United Nations. Data as at 2019. 5. Much-needed efforts to reduce inequality could also be inflationary In the last 40 years, there has been a persistent rise in wealth and income inequality around the world, contributing to a structural slowdown in consumer price inflation7. Fortunately, many governments are now making a concerted effort to reduce inequality. This could bring economic benefits and invite higher inflation \u2013 as seen in these examples: The shift towards \u201cbigger government\u201d in the United States and large parts of the industrialised world may lead to rising fiscal deficits, which could foster an inflationary environment of fiscal dominance. When lower-income households get a boost in discretionary income, they\u2019re more likely to spend it \u2013 and this additional boost in spending can push up goods and services prices. (In contrast, middle- and higher-income households already have more discretionary income and are more likely to save, rather than spend, additional cash.) As a result, economic policies that help \u201credistribute\u201d wealth and income could be inflationary (see Exhibit 5a). The combined effects of changing demographics and efforts to reduce inequality may already be showing up in a rising share of labour compensation (wages plus benefits) relative to GDP (see Exhibit 5b). In addition, we are observing voluntary increases of minimum wages by companies in order to attract staff.

Data as at 2019. Exhibit 5b: labour share is rising US labour compensation share (since 1960) Source: Refinitiv Datastream, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 4 October 2021. 6. Housing-related consumer price inflation hasn\u2019t yet surged \u2013 but it may soon While central banks in general exclude asset prices from their inflation mandate, real estate represents a grey zone. Owners\u2019 occupied housing costs (as part of the \u201crent of shelter\u201d component) affect consumer price inflation in several countries \u2013 including the United States, where rent of shelter accounts for 33% of the overall CPI basket and 42% of the core index (excluding food and energy). Within the next few quarters, the surging housing market (see Exhibit 6) is expected to drive up goods and services price inflation. (Higher home prices usually take around 12 to 18 months to spill over into consumer prices.) In this way, there is at least an indirect link to the spillover of monetary policy into asset markets. Exhibit 6: surging housing prices aren\u2019t yet been reflected in consumer price inflation CPI \u2013 rent of shelter vs model (year-over-year change, 1985 \u2013 2021) Source: Bloomberg, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 30 September 2021. 7. Stronger economic growth means more jobs \u2013 but also higher inflation The continued rapid closure of output gaps (the difference between an economy\u2019s actual and potential output; see Exhibit 7) means the global economy has rebounded well and unemployment should continue to fall. This is where the \u201cPhillips curve\u201d relationship comes into play, which states that along with lower unemployment comes higher prices. While the curve has flattened over the past 20 years, it still shows a link between low unemployment and higher services price inflation. Goods price inflation has behaved differently in recent decades, thanks to international forces helping to keep prices down. But goods prices may soon also begin to rise in a more sustainable way in light of \u201cslowbalisation\u201d, rising protectionism and the re-shoring of production \u2013 all of which are inflationary. Exhibit 7: narrowing output gaps point to higher inflation Output gaps in major developed economies (since 2000) Source: OECD. Data as at May 2021. 8. The fight against climate change could lift medium-term inflation Decarbonising the world economy to limit global warming and address climate change has become the preeminent challenge of our time. The importance of this task is undisputable, and \u201cgreen growth\u201d and similar investments may lead to higher economic output and lower inflation in the long run. Before we reach this point, however, the necessary transformation of the global economy may go hand in hand with less access to \u201ccheap\u201d energy, an increase in environment-related regulations, the obsolescence of \u201ccheap\u201d but dirty production processes and high volumes of stranded assets that are subject to write-downs. All of this means that the energy transition will likely be an inflationary one (see Exhibit 8). Yet it is also important to note that this inflationary pressure is a byproduct of internalising costs (at the product level) that have until recently been borne by other stakeholders. For an example of how policy efforts to achieve long-term climate goals have an impact on inflation, consider two recent developments. The sharp rise in gas prices globally in 2021 to some extent reflect the increased demand for energy from gas-fired power plants, which emit fewer greenhouse gases than coal-powered ones8. In addition, local governments in China recently restricted coal-fired power generation to meet climate targets set by the central government. But this also caused disruptions in many industries, thereby exacerbating global supply-side constraints and adding to inflationary pressures.

Data as at 28 June 2021. Learn more about the implications for investors Taken together, these eight factors make a compelling argument as to why consumer price inflation may turn out to be more sticky than what the market currently anticipates. As a consequence, it may be a good idea to hedge against the risk of a persistent rise in inflation.

OECD is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2 When consumers, corporations and other parties expect inflation to remain steady, their \u201canchored\u201d inflation expectations help central banks maintain price stability. If inflation expectations are de-anchored to the downside, the markets think inflation will be lower than the central banks\u2019 target level. 3 In the US, the multi-year growth in broad money supply now exceeds the multi-year growth in real GDP by a wide margin. Historically, this measure of excess liquidity has also coincided with a rise in consumer-price inflation. 4 They do this by pegging interest rates at artificially low levels to reduce the costs of servicing sovereign and private debt. 5 This also has the added political aim of helping countries ensure the domestic supply of critical products, which increases their strategic self-sufficiency. 6 For a deeper discussion of the demographic impact on inflation see, for example, Goodhart, C., Pradhan, M. (2020): \u201cThe Great Demographic Reversal\u201d and Juselius, M. and Tak\u00e1ts, E. (2018): \u201cThe enduring link between demography and inflation\u201d 7 The precise mechanism linking high inequality and low inflation remains unclear, but one driver is that lower-income households tend to consume more. Higher consumer spending tends to push up inflation, all else equal. 8 Other factors pushing up gas prices include supply-side constraints and a generally higher demand for energy.

This creates a brighter outlook for equities in 2022. China\u2019s government has moved to a more pro-growth stance, potentially creating more favourable conditions for equity markets in 2022 Investors may want to consider shifting their China equity allocations to capture the potential benefits of easier monetary spending and higher government spending Long-term trends, including high levels of business spending on new technologies, aspirations for a healthier lifestyle and ongoing financial market reforms can deliver opportunities. This article is a summary of insights from our Q1 2022 webcast on China equities that took place in early February. Learn more about investing in China China has entered a period of easier financial conditions \u2013 including rate cuts and higher government spending \u2013 that may provide a more favourable backdrop for equity markets through 2022, the Year of the Tiger. This is a welcome change from 2021, when growth slowed and China\u2019s government tightened regulation in some sectors \u2013 notably e-commerce, financial technology and private tutoring. But today, China\u2019s fiscal and monetary policy has shifted back towards supporting the economy, according to Anthony Wong, Senior Portfolio Manager at AllianzGI and lead manager for China A-share equity portfolios. \u201cWe have already seen interest rate cuts and increased fiscal spending, and top officials in China have repeatedly emphasised the importance of stability this year,\u201d Mr Wong told investors during AllianzGI\u2019s China equities webcast on 9 February. China\u2019s objective historically has been to balance growth, stability and reform, explained Tessa Wong, Product Specialist for Chinese equities at AllianzGI. This played out in the government\u2019s shifting approach during 2021. In the first half of last year, China\u2019s country\u2019s rapid recovery from the first wave of Covid-19 brought robust economic growth, which allowed the authorities to accelerate reforms and address structural problems such as weaknesses in the property market. But in the second half, this phase came to an end as the economy slowed sharply and the government\u2019s attention turned to more pro-growth measures. Onshore-offshore divergence Yet despite a well-publicized market downturn in autumn of 2021, China equities didn\u2019t all march in lockstep. Performance was markedly different between domestically-listed A-shares, which are traded in \u201conshore\u201d exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen; and the stocks traded in \u201coffshore\u201d markets, primarily Hong Kong and the US. Despite weak market sentiment, the A-shares market ended 2021 up 4%1 and attracted net monthly inflows of foreign capital throughout the year, as global investors used a period of weakness to build their long-term allocations to China. However, the government\u2019s tightening of regulation on internet-related sectors last year had a major impact on offshore markets, where many internet companies are listed. Offshore equities fell more than 20% during 20212. This drop was caused by a rapid derating of valuations as the Chinese government\u2019s regulatory changes caused sentiment to weaken, rather than a collapse in earnings expectations. By the end of 2021, both the onshore MSCI China A index and the offshore MSCI China index were trading close to their long-run average valuations, in contrast to some developed markets where valuations remain stretched by historical standards. To many investors, China equities today seem more reasonably priced than their developed market counterparts. Long-term trends are supportive, though risk factors remain Even though the policy backdrop is becoming more supportive for equity markets, important risk factors remain. China is maintaining tough public health restrictions to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant. If the virus escapes these controls, efforts to contain it could seriously disrupt the economy. China\u2019s huge property market has also been causing concern. Several highly indebted property developers ran into liquidity problems last year as limits on leverage were introduced and the market slowed. However, Mr Wong believes the government will find a way to engineer a \u201cmanaged decline\u201d in property prices rather than a crash. \u201cIf there are signs that the Chinese economy is decelerating further, we believe more aggressive rate cuts and fiscal policy actions will be taken by the government to cushion that downside risk,\u201d Mr Wong said. To capture the benefits of easier monetary spending and higher government spending, investors may want to consider shifting their China equity allocations to the exchanges and sectors that may be poised to benefit. Within the A-shares market, there are opportunities from domestic wealth managers, potential beneficiaries from rising household wealth and appetite to invest in financial markets Opportunities also exist in the long-term trends of healthy living and new technologies. The latter covers augmented and virtual reality, and the semi-conductor supply chain But investors may want to be more cautious about areas linked to the property sector, such as materials companies. The oft-cited mantra that housing is \u2018for living in, not speculation\u2019 suggests there is unlikely to be a quick rebound Mr Wong added that the much discussed \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d policy, a central objective of the Chinese government, was not intended to involve state-sponsored redistribution of wealth, as often assumed in the West. Instead, it aimed to address more systemic long-term issues for China \u2013 including high levels of leverage, wealth disparity and slowing growth. He believes that the common prosperity policy would not deflect China from its journey towards financial and economic liberalisation. Access to foreign capital and a vibrant private sector would remain central priorities for the Chinese government. For investors, China\u2019s shift towards easier financial conditions, coupled with undemanding valuations, creates a more supportive backdrop for the country\u2019s equity markets in the Year of the Tiger.

        "content": " Ukraine: investors should prioritise caution by Gregor Hirt | 24/02/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary As Russia begins a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, already vigilant investors should adopt an even more cautious position in risky assets. While the full course of the conflict is yet to be known, the implications will be wide-ranging for markets, as rising energy prices push up already high inflation. Key takeaways As Russian forces invade Ukraine, vigilance should be the watchword for investors, as the conflict could take many turns, and the humanitarian costs could be vast. Rising commodity prices would have a negative impact in an environment already dominated by higher inflation, with implications for growth and potentially monetary policy. We are watching carefully for any disruption to market liquidity, and suggest a cautious stance as market participants may reduce exposures to risky assets after years of solid performance. What has happened? So it seems that the rather timid sanctions from the West were not a deterrent for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Perhaps they were even an incentive for him to move ahead and launch a full-scale attack against Ukraine, in what now appears to be the most dramatic security crisis in Europe since World War Two. Russian forces have even begun to target the densely populated capital city, Kyiv. While Ukraine is a big country with an army previously ranked among the 30 most powerful in the world, there should be no doubt that Russia could rapidly control its airspace and destroy all key military facilities within days. The bigger question is: where will Russian ground forces and their allies stop their advance? A rapid blitz on key strategic targets would be the best-case scenario from the Russian perspective, as Moscow can hardly afford a long-term occupation and mass casualties among its armies. However, we should be fully aware \u2013 with Mr Putin\u2019s angry television speech in mind \u2013 that there is indeed a potential worst-case scenario where Russian forces come into direct contact with NATO troops. Such an escalation would undoubtedly have significant ramifications for markets, not to mention the potentially vast humanitarian costs. What was the market reaction? Early on Thursday, the S&P future was sharply down (-2.5%) and the Euro Stoxx future tumbled by more than 4%, while oil and gold were among the key safe havens bought by investors. Gas price futures are also spiking. This will likely hit the lower middle classes in most European countries hardest, leading to weaker growth, while potential blackouts could lead to production slowdown, also negatively impacting growth. Of course, this would also lead to higher inflation rates, as gas and gasoline prices continue rising and chemicals become more expensive. The ECB will be in a difficult situation. Inflation numbers are already at record levels, which had led markets to speculate on interest rate hikes this year. Nevertheless, an increase in commodity prices is, in effect, a \u201ctax\u201d on production and consumption that would negatively impact growth. So, while inflation rates could continue to rise, the ECB may adopt a more bearish stance for the time being. Overall, rising commodity prices are set to result in weaker global growth and Europe would likely be the most affected region. What does this mean for asset allocation? Our Multi Asset Fundamental Investment Committee had already recommended increasing the allocations to safe havens such as US Treasuries and gold. Wednesday\u2019s rather muted market reaction puzzled us, and so we think an even more cautious position in risky assets would be appropriate for the time being. We hold to our positive view on commodities, even though the market reaction could lead to some production support from OPEC. Importantly, we are also watching for potential disruption to market liquidity, especially in Russian or Russian-related securities as these will be impacted \u2013 increasingly \u2013 by EU and US sanctions. The EU will prohibit the buying or selling directly or indirectly of any financial instrument issued on or after 9 March by the Russian government, its central bank, government agencies, or any person acting on their behalf. This means that Russia is now excluded from issuing new debt or refinancing its debt. Substantial outflows from any related Russian instruments could ensue, and there could be knock-on effects for widely used instruments such as ETFs and derivatives. All in all, after a few years of solid performance for equities and other risky assets, this crisis may spur market participants to reduce their exposures over the coming weeks. We therefore continue to favour a cautious stance. Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested.

        "content": " Unlocking the \u201cS\u201d in capitalism 09/02/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Social issues have typically been overshadowed by other aspects of the sustainability story such as climate. That\u2019s changing. The Covid-19 pandemic has shone a light on inequalities in access to basic essentials and life opportunities \u2013 and the solution calls for a new brand of capitalism. Key takeaways The Covid-19 pandemic shone a light on the weaknesses of the modern just-in-time economy and was a stark reminder that many communities experience inequalities in accessing both life and livelihood essentials Recent events have led to a renewed focus on the \u201cS\u201d in ESG \u2013 the social issues that can hold back the growth and resilience of economies, and may be exacerbated by climate change and digitalisation The concept of \u201cinclusive capitalism\u201d is gaining steam as part of a more inclusive approach to economic growth, and it should be addressed alongside our other sustainability pillars at AllianzGI \u2013 climate change and planetary boundaries \u2013 with which it is closely interdependent By addressing inclusive capitalism via their investments, investors can accelerate the journey to a more equal world while capitalising on significant growth opportunities as new approaches and infrastructure come online The \u201cS\u201d in ESG \u2013 the environmental, social and governance factors that are a core part of sustainable investing \u2013 has long been overshadowed by other aspects of the sustainability story. Yet today, social issues are increasingly coming into focus. One reason is the Covid-19 pandemic, which has exposed serious problems that can arise when countries or communities lack the resources and opportunities that others take for granted. In the worst situations, these communities may be marginalised from society entirely, experiencing what is known as \u201csocial exclusion\u201d. There\u2019s also growing recognition that social issues are firmly interconnected with the \u201cE\u201d in ESG \u2013 namely the environment and climate change \u2013 and that all these themes should be addressed together. At Allianz Global Investors, we understand the importance of social issues to today\u2019s world. In fact, it\u2019s a core reason why the concept of \u201cinclusive capitalism\u201d is one of the three thematic pillars of our sustainability focus \u2013 alongside climate change and planetary boundaries such as biodiversity. Inclusive capitalism is integral to our goal of working with our clients to drive an inclusive, fairer and more sustainable world. We think it opens up new markets and growth opportunities as companies innovate to resolve inequalities and address the needs of underserved communities. Why inequality is a growing concern Defining inequality Addressing inequalities is at the heart of the focus on social issues \u2013 but what does inequality really mean? Income and wealth inequality are one of the main areas that need attention, but we believe financial considerations are not the only way to measure inequality. Around the world there are also big disparities in access to basic needs \u2013 the \u201clife essentials\u201d that include food, water and clean air (see Exhibit 1). People also lack \u201clivelihood essentials\u201d such as education and infrastructure. These are necessary for people to participate in economic, social and civic processes and lead productive and creative lives. In fact, UNESCO has found that \u201csocially excluded\u201d people who lack these livelihood essentials \u201cfind themselves confined to the fringes of society\u201d.1 Covid hits schooling The closing of classrooms during the pandemic has pushed 101 million children globally below the minimum reading proficiency threshold; seven million are in Western Europe and North America2. And according to the World Bank, children affected by learning losses stand to lose USD 10 trillion in future lifetime earnings \u2013 equivalent to 8% of global GDP.3 Covid-19: exposing inequalities The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the problems of exclusion and inequality, with implications beyond health and wellbeing. It\u2019s more obvious than ever that many basic needs, such as food and healthcare, are not guaranteed for many of our communities. Many people also lack access to the kind of education and financial services that would help them build better lives. These shortcomings help explain why during this crisis, progress in fighting poverty has gone into reverse. The rate of extreme poverty rose from 8.4% in 2019 to 9.5% in 2020 \u2013 the first global increase since 1998.4 These inequalities manifest themselves in various ways. In a survey by our Grassroots Research\u00ae team, 27% of French educators cited major issues with online learning during the pandemic, especially for low-income students and those in rural areas who do not have an adequate internet connection or hardware.5 And since robust technology is increasingly critical to earning a living \u2013 particularly with the growth in home working \u2013 the \u201cdigital divide\u201d between those who have adequate digital infrastructure and those who do not is a significant new driver of inequalities. Exhibit 1: life and livelihood essentials explained Another major driver is climate change. Local environmental resources are crucial for a high proportion of the poorest populations, and these resources are affected by global warming. For instance, under the medium scenario for population development, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that at 1.5\u00b0C warming 178 million people \u2013 including a high proportion of women, children and the elderly \u2013 will be affected by water stress, drought intensity and habitat degradation by 2050. At 2\u00b0C warming this figure rises to 220 million people.6 Inequality is a problem for everyone The Covid-19 pandemic is the most obvious recent example of a global crisis that has brought global inequality into stark relief. But think about the recent financial crises and increasingly regular extreme weather events. Inequalities undermine our capacity as a society to mitigate and overcome the impact of major crises like these, and as such they are a concern for everyone: Covid-19 showed how the economy relies on global and tight supply chains and exposed the lack of resilience in the \u201cjust in time\u201d model. Broken and delayed supply chains affect everyone. Consider the repercussion of a dock workers\u2019 strike on the global supply of goods. Or the effect on the price we would have to pay if the \u201cfair\u201d cost of these goods was applied that includes the social and environmental costs. Sustained inequalities often result in heightened political or even geopolitical risks. This environment is typically negative for economic growth, since it raises costs and limits the availability of capital. In many regions of the world, this has led to large-scale refugee crises. Bridging the digital divide Some 2.9 billion people remain offline globally \u2013 equal to around 37% of the world population \u2013 with 96% of them living in developing countries. Those who remain unconnected face multiple barriers, including a lack of access: some 390 million people are not even covered by a mobile broadband signal.7 Shifting the economic model towards inclusive capitalism It is time for society and economy to move to an inclusive and fair world A persistent, decades-long rise in gross domestic product (GDP) in many countries has increased overall living standards and lifted many people out of poverty. This is proof of the power of capitalism. However, measuring GDP has its limitations. It cannot shed light on unequal income distribution. Nor does GDP give any insight into other types of societal inequality \u2013 including less access to healthcare, education or infrastructure. According to the Allianz Global Wealth report, the richest 10% of the world\u2019s population together owned more than 84% of total net financial assets in 2020, and the middle class is shrinking.8 And figures from the OECD show that median incomes grew more slowly than top incomes since the mid1980s \u2013 and the Covid-19 pandemic made this trend worse. Exhibit 2: median incomes grow more slowly than top incomes Real disposable income growth by income position, average for 17 OECD countries, 1985 2016 (1985 = 100%) Note: Unweighted average for 17 countries for which long-term data are available: Canada, Germany, Denmark, Finland, France, United Kingdom, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Sweden and United States. Incomes are disposable incomes, corrected for household size Source: Chapter 2, OECD calculations from OECD Income Distribution Database. Data as at April, 2019. StatLink Data This is where the concept of inclusive capitalism is gaining steam as part of a more inclusive approach to economic growth. Consider the World Economic Forum\u2019s (WEF) recently launched Inclusive Growth Framework. In its 2020 Davos manifesto, the WEF upgraded the purpose of a company to encompass all its stakeholders \u2013 employees, customers, suppliers, local communities and society at large \u2013 in shared and sustained value creation.9 Furthermore, over 190 countries have adopted the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to support a better and more sustainable future for all. By highlighting priorities such as \u201czero poverty\u201d, \u201cdecent work and economic growth\u201d and \u201cquality education\u201d, the 17 SDGs provide a roadmap for companies to address these issues in the way they run their organisations and through their products and services. Social insecurity Before the pandemic, informal employment represented 60% of global employment. This means that 2 billion people worldwide worked in jobs characterised by lack of basic protection, including social protection coverage.10 With its focus on reflecting the needs of women, youth and local and marginalised communities in climate-related planning, SDG 13: Climate Action is particularly germane to this discussion of inclusive capitalism. SDG 13 highlights how the journeys towards both an inclusive world and a 1.5 degree-aligned world are tightly interwoven. Consider how moving to a low-carbon economy can have social repercussions, for instance if jobs are jeopardised by the shift away from fossil fuels. This is the impetus behind the calls for a \u201cjust transition\u201d. At COP26 in November 2021, more than 30 nations signed the Just Transition Declaration acknowledging \u201cthe need to ensure that no one is left behind in the transition to net zero economies\u201d.11 And this is a two-way interdependence, as human capital has to be \u201cunlocked\u201d to secure the skills necessary for climate transition. Clearly, the SDGs can provide a much-needed roadmap to address some of the world\u2019s most pressing issues related to sustainability. Early results are promising: of the 8,550 companies in the MSCI All Country World Index, nearly 40% have aligned with multiple SDGs (see Exhibit 3). Of those companies, SDG 5: Gender Equality was among the top ranked in terms of alignment. But other companies still have work to do: 7% of firms were assessed as \u201cmisaligned\u201d, noticeably on SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy.12 Exhibit 3: companies are grappling with sustainability Level of corporate alignment with SDGs 8,550 Companies This chart displays distribution of companies\u2019 assessment by SDG for a set of 8,550 companies, as at 11 August, 2020. Source: MSCI ESG Research LLC. Data as at August 2020. Closing the gap with climate While these steps are encouraging, there is still less attention paid to building a more inclusive world than addressing climate change and the environment. The UN\u2019s High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development \u2013 in effect, the SDG equivalent of the climate COP \u2013 had only its 13th iteration this year and received scant media coverage. What could explain this gap? We see both a lack of urgency and a sense that inequalities are happening in more remote countries. In addition, there are intrinsic challenges in managing social factors. Whereas the fight against climate change has a clear and measurable focus \u2013 ie, achieving net-zero emissions to stop warming \u2013 there is no single unifying quantitative goal for creating a fair and inclusive world. There is also the question of how to measure sustainable development. It encompasses multiple topics \u2013 from education, ways of working and retirement to health and financial considerations. Moreover, there are significant cultural and legal differences across countries and regions. But while the S has been a poor cousin to the E and G of ESG, it is still gaining prominence. Social issues are particularly important to millennials and Generation Z investors. And even though inequalities have increasingly come into focus in the US, this awareness is now being exported to other parts of the world. Our framework for inclusive capitalism at Allianz Global Investors Thanks to their experience with the climate transition, many investors increasingly recognise they have the power to make a positive impact through where and how they invest their capital. This applies equally to the transition to a more inclusive world. Indeed, as a firm with strong ESG credentials, Allianz Global Investors has been active for several years in integrating people-related sustainability factors in investment processes.13 As part of our ESG risk assessment, we seek to identify where investee companies may need to enhance their approach to labour relations or consider more holistically their impact on local communities. New skills needed The shift away from fossil fuels is estimated by the International Energy Agency to displace around 5 million jobs. But about 30 million new workers are needed by 2030 to meet increased demand for clean energy and low-emissions technologies; over half are highly skilled positions.14 But we know there is more that we \u2013 and the industry \u2013 can do. By making inclusive capitalism our third sustainability research theme, we are granting proper resources and efforts to identify emerging issues, driving awareness and creating change. With the interdependencies of social, climate change and environment, we will be able to address this topic alongside our other two thematic pillars: climate change and planetary boundaries. Our analysis in framing and structuring inclusive capitalism led us to distinguish life essentials and livelihood essentials. We also believe that inequalities and exclusions deserve the same level of attention, as exclusions are generally the consequence of inequalities that have been stretched beyond their tipping point, including by the pandemic. This focus will likely lead to product innovation, including new impact-focused investment strategies. It will also inform proxy-voting decisions and define themed engagement projects, which is a proven tool for increasing awareness among corporations. Concerted actions via joint initiatives, including the UN Principles for Responsible Investing, will continue to be another lever to drive change.15 Vaccine inequality For every 100 people, around 68 vaccines were administered in Europe and Northern America, compared with fewer than two in sub-Saharan Africa.16 Urgent next steps The world must take its lessons from the pandemic that revealed the need for a shift of our economic and societal model. Global leaders are setting the tone by addressing social topics. The planned introduction in 2022 by the EU of a Social Taxonomy, the social dimension of US President Joe Biden\u2019s infrastructure plan, and China\u2019s focus on \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d are strong signs that the tide is turning. We see this as the right moment to take an active stance on inclusive capitalism alongside climate change and the environment. These interwoven priorities, while representing the biggest challenges facing our planet, unlock new opportunities for investors to support the transition to a more inclusive and sustainable world.

While the full course of the conflict is yet to be known, the implications will be wide-ranging for markets, as rising energy prices push up already high inflation. Key takeaways As Russian forces invade Ukraine, vigilance should be the watchword for investors, as the conflict could take many turns, and the humanitarian costs could be vast. Rising commodity prices would have a negative impact in an environment already dominated by higher inflation, with implications for growth and potentially monetary policy. We are watching carefully for any disruption to market liquidity, and suggest a cautious stance as market participants may reduce exposures to risky assets after years of solid performance.

        "content": " Embracing Disruption Digital Darwinism: the new disruption by Virginie Maisonneuve | 08/02/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Disruption has always been around us, but we are moving to a new \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d digital era. We\u2019ve identified key themes \u2013 from climate tech to AI \u2013 that are driving this new shift in a profound way, making disruption a critical factor for investors to build into their portfolios. Key takeaways Disruption is no longer just a tech-sector phenomenon: transformative advances in hardware, software and \u201cBig Data\u201d mean that disruption is now reaching into every area of our lives Profound changes wrought by technology are leading to a kind of \u201cdigital Darwinism\u201d \u2013 a race for dominance that is redefining the winners and creating new opportunities for investors The fight for technology supremacy has wider resonance: watch for rising geopolitical tensions as countries vie to control more of the world\u2019s data Though disruption at this scale can be unsettling, investors can participate in this global shift to seek growth potential: thematic investing and sustainability can provide a window into future opportunities It is time to rethink what you thought you knew about disruption. It was once primarily associated with the technology sector \u2013 particularly the new platforms that were shaking up traditional means of ride-hailing, rentals, food delivery and more. But now, transformative advances in hardware and software \u2013 and the sheer proliferation of data \u2013 are pushing disruptive forces into more sectors and areas of our lives than ever before \u2013 and at an exponential rate. This is leading to a kind of \u201cdigital Darwinism\u201d \u2013 a global phenomenon that will sweep some businesses aside, allow others to secure a dominant market share and potentially even affect the world\u2019s geopolitical order. Like the evolutionary process after which it\u2019s named, digital Darwinism is a shift at the cellular level, and it\u2019s changing the world we live in. But there\u2019s good news for investors. Not only can you invest in and benefit from growth and profit opportunities \u2013 you can also contribute to positive real-world outcomes. Three key investment themes for the new disruption 1. Climate & technology In May 2021, US climate change envoy John Kerry claimed that half of the reductions necessary to achieve net-zero emissions \u201care going to come from technologies we don\u2019t yet have\u201d. \u201cClimate tech\u201d advancements \u2013 from artificial intelligence (AI) powered marketplaces for carbon offsets to improved power transmission infrastructure \u2013 can help reduce the impact of global warming. According to PwC, in the year leading up to June 2021, USD 87.5 billion was invested in companies combating the climate crisis, compared with USD 24.8 billion the year before.1 And since 2013, more than 60% of all venture capital funding has poured into technologies related to mobility and transport \u2013 an area that includes electric vehicles. (See chart.) There also seems to be a disconnect between the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that certain sectors produce compared with the funding they receive. For example, only 9% of funding went to manufacturing during the same period, even though it contributed 29% of GHG emissions. This could give investors a prime opportunity to fund new climate-focused technologies. Many emissions-reducing technologies may be underfunded Share of global emissions and climate tech venture investment by challenge area Source: PwC \u201cState of Climate Tech\u201d 2021. 2. Data & connectivity With so much of the world\u2019s population connected digitally, disruptive innovations can sweep across the globe at a breakneck pace. Consider that more than 60% of the world\u2019s population is connected to the internet2 \u2013 compared with approximately zero percent in the early 1980s. All this connectivity is generating 2.5 quintillion bytes of data a day3. What\u2019s more, the internet of things (IoT)4 grew by 9% in 2021, reaching 12.3 billion connections5. And \u201c6G\u201d technology (where China is currently leading the way) could be 100 times more powerful than 5G. This could move far beyond \u201csmart homes\u201d to \u201csmart cities\u201d, which could help address significant economic, social and environmental challenges. So what is all this infrastructure \u2013 and the data it transmits \u2013 leading to? The next phase of the internet \u2013 which some call the \u201cmetaverse\u201d \u2013 could bring the virtual and online worlds closer together. How many students would not prefer to \u201cwalk\u201d into an old Roman village rather than simply read about it, and who wouldn\u2019t want to \u201ctour\u201d a remodeled kitchen before work starts? The metaverse could lead to new revenue streams for well-positioned companies, especially those connected to fields such as shopping, education, entertainment and electronic payment systems. 3. Man & machine Throughout history, there have been great evolutionary leaps that have propelled life forward \u2013 the original \u201cbiological disruption\u201d. We may be approaching a similar moment today. Some estimate that by 2045, machine learning and AI could usher in the \u201csingularity\u201d \u2013 the moment when machines will be smarter than humans.7 But even if that moment never comes, new technologies are having a profound impact on the quality and length of life. Consider how science seems to be following its own \u201cMoore\u2019s law\u201d, with new technologies being implemented at an increasingly rapid rate while the cost steadily declines. The fast-growing field of genomics8 offers the prospect of earlier identification and treatment of genetic illnesses, and has led to the speedy introduction of new solutions to the Covid-19 crisis. And in the field of nanotechnology9, scientists have developed an injectable \u201cliquid retinal prosthesis\u201d that may someday be able to help blind people see again.10 Prepare for \u201cdigital Darwinism\u201d Just as Charles Darwin and other naturalists expounded a theory of evolution founded on the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d, we are seeing a competitive landscape reshaped by the ability of individual businesses to adapt and thrive. But the \u201cwinner takes all\u201d implications of this race to technology supremacy \u2013 and the influence that comes with it \u2013 has wider resonance. Arguably it is at the heart of geopolitical tensions, for example between the US and China, perhaps even more so than questions around trade. Control of data gives control of power. And with an imperative to protect digitised businesses, robust cybersecurity is a must. The cost of global cybercrime could reach USD 10.5 trillion in 2025, up from USD 3 trillion in 201511. This represents a fast-growing industry in itself: global spending on cybersecurity is estimated to exceed USD 1.75 trillion from 2021-2025.12 Two takeaways for investors 1. Rethink how portfolios are constructed In this low-yield environment, where growth and income potential are at a premium, it\u2019s important to take a different approach to portfolio construction \u2013 one that may be able to capitalise on disruptive opportunities. Perhaps in addition to core diversified funds, investors should consider these areas: Thematic investing can help investors capitalise on opportunities emerging from this wave of disruption. Thematic funds \u2013 such as those focused on \u201chealthy living\u201d or \u201csmart cities\u201d \u2013 can provide a window into future opportunities, a new prism alongside traditional ways of classifying investments by sector or geography. Sustainability in all its guises is an essential consideration for investors today \u2013 particularly the need to combat climate change, which is one of the dangerously disruptive forces in the world. Fortunately, investors can align their portfolios with investments that can help effect real-world change. \u201cGreen\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d bonds can help finance projects specifically associated with climate change and ocean conservation. But sustainability has also moved beyond climate, and now impacts every area of our lives. Investments aligned with the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals can help align countries, organisations, companies and individuals from around the world to help protect the planet, end poverty and improve life for communities globally. Disruption and sustainability go hand-in-hand from an investment perspective. When seeking to identify the winners of this era of disruption, it is more critical than ever to use sustainability factors to assess the true roots of resilience, success and longevity for the companies we invest in. 2. Tap the power of disruptive tech in the investment process To take full advantage of the \u201cnew\u201d disruption, investors should incorporate new, possibly disruptive technologies into their investment process. Consider all the factors that go into creating long-term investment solutions \u2013 whether growth or value, fundamental or quantitative. Portfolio managers must assess business models and valuations, analyse sustainability factors, and evaluate management teams, corporate governance and organisational culture. The ability to harness the explosion of available data on companies and trends \u2013 from multiple sources around the world in real time \u2013 is critical. So is the ability to analyse it expertly \u2013 and focus on what is relevant. At Allianz Global Investors, we are constantly developing tools to support our portfolio managers in their search for alpha \u2013 including financial and \u201coutcome-linked\u201d alpha \u2013 while staying agile in the face of changing market conditions. Within our investment processes, we are using data in greater volumes than ever before. We are deploying AI and natural language processing (NLP) in multiple languages to put the latest insight at our fingertips. Disruption may be intrinsically unsettling. But we are convinced that it is something to be embraced because of the opportunities it presents and the sheer, urgent necessity of turning its repercussions to your advantage. How a grain of rice can illustrate exponential growth Recall the Indian folk story of the origins of the game of chess. Thrilled with this new game, the king asked its inventor what he would like in return. The inventor asked for one grain of rice for the first square of the chessboard, two for the second, four for the third and so on \u2013 the amount doubling with each square. The king agreed to this apparently modest request, but by the 64th square, he owed 18 quintillion grains of rice \u2013 enough to cover India in a layer one metre deep. Download the pdf version 1.

That\u2019s changing. The Covid-19 pandemic has shone a light on inequalities in access to basic essentials and life opportunities \u2013 and the solution calls for a new brand of capitalism. Key takeaways The Covid-19 pandemic shone a light on the weaknesses of the modern just-in-time economy and was a stark reminder that many communities experience inequalities in accessing both life and livelihood essentials Recent events have led to a renewed focus on the \u201cS\u201d in ESG \u2013 the social issues that can hold back the growth and resilience of economies, and may be exacerbated by climate change and digitalisation The concept of \u201cinclusive capitalism\u201d is gaining steam as part of a more inclusive approach to economic growth, and it should be addressed alongside our other sustainability pillars at AllianzGI \u2013 climate change and planetary boundaries \u2013 with which it is closely interdependent By addressing inclusive capitalism via their investments, investors can accelerate the journey to a more equal world while capitalising on significant growth opportunities as new approaches and infrastructure come online Load More "

        "content": " Active is: Seeing opportunity where others see challenge With so much for markets to digest, investors need to be agile by Gregor Hirt | 25/01/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Markets are off to a rocky start to 2022, as challenges ranging from a more hawkish Fed to sabre-rattling in Ukraine test investors\u2019 resolve. Despite fading support from central banks, investors can find opportunities by staying agile and focusing on companies with resilient earnings. Key takeaways This year is unlikely to be plain sailing for the financial markets, and the first weeks have confirmed this diagnosis Even though investors have a lot of issues to navigate, markets still offer potential \u2013 the key is to be agile The overall long-term \u201cexcess liquidity\u201d environment is morphing into a more hawkish, restrictive one \u2013 so earnings resilience should be a focus for investors Given the backdrop, we prefer cyclical value to growth-oriented companies After a relatively calm holiday break, the first weeks of the year have already confirmed our assumption that 2022 would not be a \u201cstraight line\u201d, to say the least. The latest weakness in quite a few markets, especially in the US, led to some technical support levels being broken, as some indexes fell below what were assumed to be price \u201cfloors\u201d. As January tends to be a robust month for risky assets, the retreat comes at an unusual point in time. The fact that many investors still have relatively long exposures or overweights likely explains part of the profit-taking. But the bigger issue may be that markets simply have too much to digest. While market participants can take one problem at a time in their stride, they came back from the holidays to face several issues, including: A more hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) narrative and the fiscal challenges in the US. Sabre-rattling in Ukraine. The prospect of war in Ukraine is understandably weighing on investors\u2019 minds, and the probability of conflict may have worsened in recent days. But the market impact could be short-lived based on the experience of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2014, when equity indices recovered rapidly. This time, however, already-high commodity prices and bottlenecks could have a stronger economic impact on the European economy. Renewed tensions in China\u2019s real estate market. Our base case remains that the Chinese government manages to control the timing of the real estate slowdown, but even so the probability of a bursting of the debt bubble has slightly increased. Should investors buy the dip? Should we fear a repeat of the 2018 market dive that saw US stocks drop 19%? Or is this just another short-lived correction and investors should \u201cbuy the dip\u201d? Despite what we are hearing in the press, it is not entirely true that the market has run out of breath. Indeed, while low-quality stocks have suffered, the equal-weighted US equity markets have remained pretty much aligned with the capital-weighted market. Remember as well that, based on past experience, a Fed rate hike \u201cper se\u201d is not always negative on stocks (see Exhibit 1). This is even less so for stocks outside the US. Since markets have been digesting Fed rate hikes for months, a lot of negativity should already be priced in. Exhibit 1: US stocks have historically shrugged off Fed rate hikes within a year Average S&P 500 Index returns during Fed rate-hike cycles (1986-2015) Source: Bloomberg, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 17 January 2022. All-time average performance based on rolling overlapping observation period; rate hike period performance based on mid-month observations (15th). Past performance is not indicative of future results. But we could imagine a secondary scenario, where falling inflation later this year coincides with slower economic growth caused by the impact of earlier price rises on consumers. This may force the Fed to put its rate hikes on hold. Similarly, if inflation starts to impact wages and rents, the European Central Bank (ECB) could turn out to be surprisingly hawkish \u2013 resulting in higher or faster rate hikes than the markets expect. This would detract from our positive view on the US dollar. Overall, however, we must recognise that the overall long-term environment of excess liquidity \u2013 with central banks greatly increasing the economy\u2019s money supply \u2013 is morphing into a more hawkish, restrictive one. The fight against inflation will be the focus of the Fed\u2019s attention for at least the coming month. As central banks tighten up the money supply, it will likely remove one of the pillars that have supported the strong performance of risky assets like stocks. Strangely enough, the \u201cgood news\u201d about Omicron\u2019s rapid fading and relative lack of fatality could provide comfort to central banks in their new \u201creaction\u201d function. So it will be a fine balance: good news from the trade logistics and supply chain front could be negated by stricter central bank policies. Watch for earnings All of this should encourage us to look even more carefully than in the past at earnings, especially as valuations remain stretched (especially in the US, although arguably less so in Europe and Japan). And here the picture could also start deteriorating as employment and commodity costs start biting into companies\u2019 profit margins (see Exhibit 2). This trend will likely affect smaller US companies that have trouble finding staff, while larger companies should continue to profit from the \u201coligopolisation\u201d that has taken place over the last decade in many sectors of the economy. This should allow them to pass on some of the higher costs of producing their goods or services, even though this would be to the detriment of consumers. Exhibit 2: employment and commodity costs could start shrinking profit margins Net profit margins vs employment costs (1984-2022) Source: Refinitiv Datastream, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 18 January 2022. What does this mean for asset allocation? Investors should keep a calm head and observe the situation carefully. As the fundamental picture weakens, and the excess liquidity and support of central banks fades, the resilience of corporate earnings should be the key focus. Considering the relative valuations, the US stockmarket might be a notch more affected than Europe or Japan. This differential is beginning to be reflected in the relative preference of our Multi Asset expert group. We continue to support value stocks (whose prices appear to be lower than what the financials support) as opposed to growth stocks (which carry higher prices in exchange for the potential for more growth down the road). More to the point, we prefer cyclical value stocks in particular \u2013 those whose prices tend to move in tandem with the economy. And, despite a short-term topping-out, we continue to see valuations as attractive in the longer term (see Exhibit 3). We expect US Treasuries to fall in value in the short term, as we still expect inflation to surprise on the upside. But with Fed interventions, we could pretty soon be in a position to be more positive about Treasuries if markets move ahead of themselves. And finally, commodities continue to represent an attractive hedge in this environment if one considers that the inflation risk remains underestimated. To summarise: agility will be required in the coming weeks.

Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested. Equities have tended to be volatile, and do not offer a fixed rate of return. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bond prices will normally decline as interest rates rise. The impact may be greater with longer-duration bonds.

        "content": " Unwrapping the potential of sustainable packaging by Kofi Kodua | 04/01/2022 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Plastics \u2013 and especially plastic packaging \u2013 play an essential role in the global economy, as they prevent products from being spoiled, and significantly extend the shelf-life of food. Additionally, the comparatively low weight of plastic packaging contributes to energy and fuel savings, and to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from freight transport. However, the advantages of plastics have to be set against a number of drawbacks, particularly for the environment. The absence of a circular plastic economy, and the leakage of millions of tonnes of plastic material, not only contribute in large part to marine pollution, but also trigger immense economic costs, and billions of USD in negative externalities. Fostering the further development of sustainable packaging therefore not only helps to limit the volume of plastic waste, but also offers attractive opportunities to participate in a market that is predicted to show a double-digit percentage growth rate within the next five years. Key takeaways According to analysis, 95% of plastic packaging material value, equivalent to between USD 80\u2013120 billion per year, leaves the economy (in the form of waste).1 The recycling rate of plastics is only around 14%. Due to additional value losses during sorting and reprocessing, only about 5% of plastic packaging is reused for packaging, while most of the remaining 9% is used for lower-value applications.2 Nearly a third of all plastic packaging is not available for recycling.3 Plastic packaging contributes almost USD 40 billion-worth of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental damage every year.4 Expenditures arising from these post-use effects, as well as from greenhouse gas emissions caused by plastic production, amount to at least USD 40 billion annually.5 The sustainable-packaging market is expected to grow from an estimated USD 305 billion in 2020 to almost USD 470 billion in 2027.6 The price tag of \u201cplastubiquity\u201d \"Around the world, one million plastic drinking bottles are purchased every minute, while 5 trillion single-use plastic bags are used worldwide every year.7\" In the modern economy plastic has become indispensable, ubiquitous and maybe the most versatile material in terms of applications. Its success is primarily based on its exceptional functional characteristics \u2013 in numerous potential application areas such as construction, transportation, healthcare and electronics \u2013 as well as on its comparatively low production costs. However low the manufacturing \u201cprice tag\u201d might be, the lifetime costs of plastics are very high. A WWF report suggests that in 2019 the plastic pollution, emissions and clean-up costs amounted to at least USD 3.7 trillion, which is more than India\u2019s GDP, and many times greater than the market cost.8 The lifetime cost of plastic produced in 2019 Ten times greater than the market cost Note: Numbers are rounded to the nearest billion.

Source: https://www.wwf.org.au/news/blogs/the-lifecycle-of-plastics More than four decades after the introduction of the first universal recycling symbol, the plastic recycling rate still has significant room for improvement. Compared to paper (58%) and iron and steel (70\u201390%), the recycling of plastics in general, and even more so of plastic packaging, is still in its infancy, with only 14% of plastic packaging being collected for recycling.9 Consequently, turning the recycling of plastic into a \u201ccircular economy\u201d will help to build a more restorative and regenerative system, where plastic is reused as well as recycled. Adhering to the \u201ctriad of eliminate, innovate and circulate\u201d would also lead to a reduction in plastic waste by 80%, and to a cut of 20% in greenhouse gas emissions over the next two decades, while at the same time generating 700,000 additional jobs, and USD 200 billion in annual savings.10 Source: Project Mainstream analysis. This would also speed up the decoupling of plastic production from non-regenerative energy sources. 98% of annually produced single-use plastics are actually fabricated from fossil fuels.11 Over the coming decades, the demand for oil for plastics production is expected to increase even more, growing at 3.8% until 2030, and then at 3.5% to 2050, and thus at a faster pace than the overall demand for oil, which is projected to step up by only 0.5% per year.12 Between pollution, bans and waste prevention \"By 2050, single-use plastic production could account for 5-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions.12\" No matter how versatile plastic may be, and however vast the cost savings and efficiencies delivered by its application in various areas, the impact of (unmanaged) plastic waste on the environment is devastating. Projected share of global mismanaged plastic waste in 2025 Source: https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution Estimates state that plastic currently makes up 85% of marine litter,14 and that by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean, by weight, than fish.15 Other studies indicate that since the outbreak of Covid-19 approximately 8.4m tonnes of protective masks, gloves and other inadequately managed plastic waste from the pandemic entered the ocean, originating from 193 countries.16 The pathway by which plastic enters the world\u2019s oceans Estimates of global plastics entering the oceans from land-based sources in 2010 based on the pathway from primary production through to marine plastic inputs. Source: https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution In the face of these alarming scenarios, reducing plastic waste and recycling plastic mark important steps towards a stricter protection of our planet from single-use plastic waste \u2013 even more so when considering that a quarter of global plastics waste goes into incineration, and that 40% ends up in waste dumps and landfills17, literally \u201cevaporating\u201d valuable resources. Yet not every well-meant approach to recycling plastic waste is beneficial for the environment. This is particularly true for \u201cwishcycling\u201d, defined by the Collins English Dictionary18 as \u201cthe practice of putting something in a recycling bin without being certain that it is actually recyclable\u201d. In this context, a Pew Research Center survey found that more than half of Americans believe that \u201cmost types of items\u201d can be recycled.19 Sustainable packaging can be a solution \u2013 and an investment opportunity Even though it is highly desirable to establish a plastic circular economy, where plastic products are designed to be easily reused or recycled (\u201cdesign for recyclability\u201d20), while in parallel reducing the necessity for and the use of single-use plastic products, plastic recycling alone can\u2019t be a long-term solution for building a sustainable circular system. Nor would it be possible to reduce consumption enough (and thereby reduce packaging) without drastically slowing the global economy. In this context, moving from plastic to sustainable packaging would mark a great leap forward \u2013 and many corporations are already doing their part. This gives investors a way to support the drive for less wasteful consumption, and a cleaner planet. Additionally, it opens interesting angles to participate in the ever-growing market segment of compostable and biodegradable bioplastics and biopolymers made from renewable sources like corn starch, tapioca roots, chips, starch or sugarcane. Projections suggest that the global bioplastics and biopolymers market size will nearly triple, from USD 10.7 billion in 2021 to USD 29.7 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 22.7%.21 From a regional perspective, the Asia-Pacific bioplastics industry is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 12.35% in the period from 2021 to 2030.22 On a segment basis, in 2020 packaging accounted for the largest share in the bioplastics and biopolymers market in terms of value, followed by textiles and consumer goods.23 The drivers for a surging bioplastics demand The dynamic of the expansion of the global bioplastics and biopolymers market has industry-internal as well as external drivers, like stricter regulations, and taxes on or bans of single-use plastic. However, shifting consumer preference also plays its part in driving the development, production and distribution of more environmentally-friendly alternatives to conventional plastic. In a recent consumer survey by the Boston Consulting Group, almost three-quarters of 15,000 respondents (and 83% among younger generations) said they would pay more for products with environmentally-friendly packaging, and over a fifth would pay an additional 10%. 64% of respondents also said that sustainable packaging was an important factor in their purchasing decisions.24 Putting a price on sustainability Source: https://triviumpackaging.com/sustainability/2021BuyingGreenReport.pdf Driven by consumers as well as by regulations, industries are gradually favouring the production and deployment of bioplastics and biopolymers to address environmental and economic issues, and also to mitigate the continuing price pressure exercised by the rising cost of fossil fuels. In addition, advances in R&D (i.e., lower production costs and faster production processes) are also accelerating the rise of bioplastics and biopolymers as a viable alternative to conventional polymers like Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), Highdensity polyethylene (HDPE), Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) or Polypropylene (PP) and Polystyrene (PS). Finally, a growing population and rapid urbanisation \u2013 and therefore the increasing demand for sustainable alternatives to conventional plastic from end-use industries \u2013 play their part in fostering the growth of sustainable packaging solutions. Allianz Global Investors \u201cunwraps\u201d the potential of sustainable packaging innovators Allianz Global Investors identifies companies that produce compostable and/or biodegradable bioplastics and biopolymers made from 100% renewable resources like mushrooms, corn starch, potato starch and used cooking oil. Their solutions can be decisive contributions to addressing the pressing challenges arising from the production and use of conventional polymers and single-use plastic packaging, and from the devastating impact that mismanaged and nonrecycled plastic waste has on the environment. At the very least, relying on bioplastics and biopolymers could help to save billions of USD in societal and economic costs. Allianz Global Investors also continues to invest in innovators specialising in the manufacture, development and design of products made from post-consumer recycled plastic, helping to prevent billions of pounds (lbs) of plastic waste that would otherwise likely leak into inland waterways or into the ocean.

        "content": " Carbon offsets: debate to define role in net zero by Julien Girault | 06/12/2021 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Carbon offsets sparked fierce debate between policymakers and campaigners during COP26. Such discussion is vital to help fix some of the perceived flaws in a tool that will have a role to play in the net-zero drive. Key takeaways Carbon offsets allow governments and companies to offset their carbon emissions and can be mandatory or voluntary. Voluntary carbon offsets (VCOs) are booming as part of rising net zero commitments: the market is estimated to top USD 1 billion in 2021. Debate about how to strengthen offsetting ecosystems is vital amid criticism that offsets provide a licence to pollute by enabling entities to focus on cutting net \u2013 rather than gross \u2013 emissions. A rulebook for carbon markets was agreed at COP26, marking a significant step in the development of the burgeoning carbon credits industry. What are carbon offsets? Carbon offsets allow an entity to compensate for its own carbon emissions with eliminated or avoided emissions from other activities or dedicated \u201ccarbon (offset) projects\u201d. This compensation is made through carbon offset credits, with one credit relating to one metric tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)1 of emissions. Carbon offsets should not be mistaken for carbon credits, which are centralised tools for regulating the decarbonisation of high-emitting sectors. Granted by authorities, a carbon credit gives companies in certain sectors the right to emit greenhouses gases (GHGs). These credits can be traded to comply with set quotas. Today the best known and largest carbon market is the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), launched in 2005 and, which accounts for 90% of global carbon credits volumes and 40% of EU emissions (Exhibit 1). It is based on the \u201ccap and trade\u201d principle, a system for controlling carbon emissions. That said, carbon offset credits linked to emission-reducing projects \u2013 known as Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) \u2013 can also be traded on these regulated carbon markets. These are backed by UN guidelines and can be purchased by companies needing to comply with imposed carbon emissions caps. When a company voluntarily purchases carbon offsets to lower its net emissions, rather than to comply with mandatory emissions targets, these are called voluntary carbon offsets (VCOs).

Washington, DC: Forest Trends Association. Based on purchased carbon offsets\u2019 volumes. The booming market in voluntary carbon offsets Although the VCO market is still a fraction of the mandatory market in terms of traded carbon credit volumes, it is growing quickly. Many businesses that struggle to reduce emissions as quickly as they might wish or that find it tricky to outline a pathway to fully eliminate emissions are turning to VCOs to help. In 2020, the VCO and mandatory markets were worth approximately USD 500 million and USD 270 billion respectively.2 But the VCO market is expected to top USD 1 billion this year (representing approximately 300 million tonnes CO2e). This market would need to grow by at least 15 times by 2030 in order to be aligned with the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to a 1.5\u00b0C rise by 2050.3 The pace of development in the whole ecosystem for VCOs is being driven by stakeholders across the value chain \u2013 from offset project developers to certifiers, brokers and final buyers. In many cases, VCOs direct private financing to climate-action projects that would otherwise struggle to gain financing. Unlike the mandatory market, VCO markets are not subject to regulation or international agreements and are accessible to all participants. The purchasers are mostly companies that wish to report lower net emissions (Exhibit 2). What projects are used to generate voluntary carbon offsets? Carbon projects can be broadly classified in two ways. The first is \u201cpurpose\u201d, which includes projects that remove CO2 emissions directly from the atmosphere, as well as those that avoid emissions altogether. The second is \u201corigin\u201d, which includes nature or technology-based solutions. An example of a project that removes emissions through a nature-based solution is the Athna project in Alaska,4 which focuses on carbon capture through fighting deforestation. The project helps local communities to switch their source of income from selling trees to selling carbon credits from carbon-capture projects. Projects that tackle non-CO2 ozone-depleting substances such as refrigerant or aerosol gases are another example. These projects are qualified as an avoidance and technology-based solution. The level of investment for each project depends on its qualifications, with basic renewable energy projects at the lower cost end and the most technologically advanced carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects at the expensive end (Exhibit 3).

Based on purchased carbon offsets\u2019 volumes. Why are carbon offsets so divisive? During COP26, carbon offsets were a focus of debate and revived the fear from climate campaigners of interpreting Article 6 of the Paris Agreement as a mandate to develop carbon offsets further, rather than applying pressure on entities to cut back their gross emissions. The final deal agreed by governments aims to implement Article 6 as a rulebook for carbon markets, marking a significant step in the development of the burgeoning market for carbon credits by providing a consistent and transparent framework. The core principle of VCOs is so-called additionality, whereby GHG reductions must come over and above those realised by business-as-usual mitigation activities and policies for climate transition. This would be done through projects that would be uneconomic without the funding derived from carbon offset credits. Other criteria for VCOs include: Accountability \u2013 measurable and verifiable. Irrevocability \u2013 permanent impact over time Assurance of no harm \u2013 no incremental CO2e emissions over the entire value chain and no harm caused in other sustainability domains (biodiversity, social). The verification of these factors is complex and subject to interpretation, especially on additionality. Organisations verifying the criteria include Gold Standard, Climate Action Reserve, Verified Carbon Standards, and the American Carbon Registry, who all label the credits as Verified Emission Reductions (VERs). But the respective standards vary and, whereas CERs are eligible for both mandatory and voluntary markets, VERs can be used only in the voluntary market. The quality of the underlying project is a key driver of the VER credit price, but given the smaller scale of the voluntary market, pricing can be unduly influenced by speculative buyers or old and often poor-quality credits. This creates a significant pricing divergence between the voluntary and the mandatory markets, the latter largely controlled by regulators. As a result, voluntary market pricing appears to have decoupled from the real cost of the underlying projects. Recognising the problem, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has stated it is essential to have an ambitious carbon price to influence changes in practice. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) has urged caution, while the SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative) does not take voluntary offsets into account in company science-based targets for emission reductions. Lastly, there can be double-counting issues where a government wants to claim recognition for offsets that it then sells onto to another sovereign. There are benefits from appropriately priced, good quality VCOs and the role these can play in financing climate transition. But the current debate is healthy to avoid the unintended consequences of the existing structure. How to consider carbon offsets in investment Decarbonisation within an entity\u2019s own value chain is the absolute priority and starts at the level of gross emissions. As such, not only should the scale and scope of the use of carbon offsets in an entity\u2019s decarbonisation pathway be considered, but also how they impact strategic decisions. For example, is the cost of buying carbon offsets at the expense of funds that would otherwise be spent on decarbonisation, climate mitigation or adaptation? While the current data capture on the specifics around carbon offsets remains weak, we note that the topic is increasingly highlighted in climate engagement, and company management teams are under pressure to outline the scale, scope and strategy of offsets. What is the future of carbon offsets? We expect the debate around carbon offsets to persist after COP26. Collective intelligence is evolving around the climate impact from verified carbon offsets, criticism is shaping standards, and companies are being forced to formally articulate, measure and report their gross and net decarbonisation strategies. The Task Force on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets and the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative are two major initiatives to shape this market. The first will focus on the standardisation of the market, while the second will address the issue of integrity; both will touch on disclosure. COP26 is likely to further accelerate an already fast-evolving segment, especially as we approach the inclusion of Scope 3 emissions in targets. While we at Allianz Global Investors continue to consider the best avenues to capture the data around offsets, we use engagement as the primary method for understanding the scale and scope of their use by invested companies. This engagement is done either bilaterally with invested companies or through collective initiatives, including the IIGCC. Direct and gross decarbonisation remains our priority, but a refined and evolving carbon offset market has a role to play in assisting the pathway. Ultimately, for carbon offsets to have an impact by 2050, there needs to be a robust mechanism for making sure decarbonisation targets are more than just accounting adjustments.

Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested. Equities have tended to be volatile, and do not offer a fixed rate of return. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bond prices will normally decline as interest rates rise. The impact may be greater with longer-duration bonds. Credit risk reflects the issuer\u2019s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal\u2014the lower the rating, the higher the risk of default. Emerging markets may be more volatile, less liquid, less transparent, and subject to less oversight, and values may fluctuate with currency exchange rates.

Additionally, the comparatively low weight of plastic packaging contributes to energy and fuel savings, and to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from freight transport. However, the advantages of plastics have to be set against a number of drawbacks, particularly for the environment. The absence of a circular plastic economy, and the leakage of millions of tonnes of plastic material, not only contribute in large part to marine pollution, but also trigger immense economic costs, and billions of USD in negative externalities. Fostering the further development of sustainable packaging therefore not only helps to limit the volume of plastic waste, but also offers attractive opportunities to participate in a market that is predicted to show a double-digit percentage growth rate within the next five years. Key takeaways According to analysis, 95% of plastic packaging material value, equivalent to between USD 80\u2013120 billion per year, leaves the economy (in the form of waste).1 The recycling rate of plastics is only around 14%. Due to additional value losses during sorting and reprocessing, only about 5% of plastic packaging is reused for packaging, while most of the remaining 9% is used for lower-value applications.2 Nearly a third of all plastic packaging is not available for recycling.3 Plastic packaging contributes almost USD 40 billion-worth of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental damage every year.4 Expenditures arising from these post-use effects, as well as from greenhouse gas emissions caused by plastic production, amount to at least USD 40 billion annually.5 The sustainable-packaging market is expected to grow from an estimated USD 305 billion in 2020 to almost USD 470 billion in 2027.6 Load More "

        "content": " Stewardship Principles Achieving best practice through engagement by Antje Stobbe | 29/10/2021 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Engagement with portfolio companies is a central tenet of our active investment approach. A new series \u2013 Stewardship Principles \u2013 will outline the way we work with the companies we invest in to promote best corporate governance practice and collectively work towards environmental and social transformation. Key takeaways Strong governance is vital to investment performance, and enables boards and management to address environmental and social issues Best practice in governance can differ between sectors and geographies, reflecting distinct regulatory frameworks or market and sectoral specifics When evaluating environmental resolutions, investors should consider how ambitious a company\u2019s climate pledges are, how they compare with their peers\u2019, and the accountability of the board in fulfilling them Climate change has been a long-standing theme in our engagement work, in particular the promotion of transparency around companies\u2019 climate transition strategies At Allianz Global Investors, we invest for the long term across a range of different investment strategies and are committed to an active stewardship approach. In 2020 we engaged 224 companies on more than 490 topics and voted at more than 10,000 shareholder meetings. Our new publication series \u2013 \u201cStewardship Principles\u201d \u2013 aims at providing insights into our approach to engagement and voting using several select principles and positions that guide us. These will help highlight what we consider best practice in corporate governance or executive board remuneration, for example. The series will also suggest the introduction of new governance concepts for certain markets or industries, and analyse changing market trends, such as linking climate strategy to voting. We think that such a series of publications is a timely response to increasing demands from our clients and regulators alike, relating to all aspects of governance as well as environmental and social issues. We routinely engage in dialogue with investee companies and seek to proactively present a viewpoint, in particular where we have larger holdings and see issues. We seek change where necessary and monitor the results of our engagement. With this new series, we will also highlight positions we have taken in engagements with our portfolio companies and share selected results of those engagement activities. Our investment views are influenced by the outcomes of these engagements and inform our voting decisions at the companies\u2019 general meetings, as we apply a consistent stewardship approach. Highlighting best practice in corporate governance We think that strong governance practices are critical enablers of investment performance. With these practices in place, boards and management can better address other highly relevant issues, including environmental and social transformation and risks. We engage with companies on a variety of corporate governance topics. Examples include: Board composition Succession planning for directors and senior management Structures and levels of executive remuneration Issues relating to shareholder rights (for example, in the context of takeover-related matters) We apply our proxy-voting policy globally based on a consistent set of rules. However, we sometimes observe that governance practice differs from market to market, reflecting distinct regulatory frameworks or diverging governance standards. In our new publication series, we highlight best practice in certain markets to inform our engagement dialogue in others. For example, in several countries the concept of a lead independent director (LID) is widespread to counterbalance the combined role of chair and CEO. We believe that greater use of LIDs could help to support the corporate governance framework in Germany, where it is not prevalent today. The \u201cStewardship Principles\u201d will explain more on this topic. Encouraging improved governance practice for founder-led or small companies In this series, we will also examine governance issues that apply to certain sectors, and smaller or founder-led companies. For example, listed US technology companies often continue to be run by their founders, who also retain large or majority shareholdings. This situation can lead to questions over their compensation policies that require active investors to engage directly with the board \u2013 a topic we will elaborate on in a future edition. Extending stewardship practices into fixed income While equity investors can use voting to exert influence on managements, there is no equivalent in fixed income. And in fact, central bank purchases of bonds have weakened the ability of investors to push back against weak stakeholder provisions. Historically, fixed-income investors have been able to achieve leverage on topics like covenants and reporting only in volatile markets where issuers face a greater challenge to access capital markets. However, we believe traction can be achieved through bilateral discussions with companies and industry bodies to strengthen terms. To some extent, rising regulatory demands on sustainability disclosures may facilitate this. We will discuss this further in a future publication. Focusing on the inherent link between E, S and G issues Governance practices are evolving continuously. Investors have been focusing more and more on linking sustainability-related issues with voting decisions and are thus recognising an inherent link between the individual strands of an ESG (environmental, social and governance) approach. The 2021 voting season saw an unprecedented rise in attention around climate-related resolutions. The so-called \u201cSay on Climate\u201d \u2013 which asks management to seek an investor vote on a company\u2019s climate strategy, targets and achievements \u2013 brought a new angle to the discussion. A number of companies tabled such a resolution, mostly in Europe. After initial considerations this year, investors may need to focus on the ambition level of the pledges undertaken, comparability of the pathways companies embark on, and \u2013 crucially \u2013 responsibility and commitment of the board going forward. Incentivising the board for the long-term plays an important role in this context. Thus, principles for the incorporation of sustainability-related KPIs into management board compensation are an important feature of this debate \u2013 another topic to discuss in our new series. Sharing results from our themed engagements In addition to direct engagement with boards and management of key holdings, we lead targeted, themed engagement projects. These are guided by our three major themes: Climate, Planetary Boundaries and Inclusive Capitalism. Climate change has been a long-time focus topic of our engagement work. Our engagement professionals discuss our expectations related to the disclosure of a climate-transition strategy with our portfolio companies and question their role in transition. We also want to understand whether companies follow internationally accepted climate reporting formats in their disclosure. Frequently, we observe that our portfolio companies would appreciate more guidance on the topics we engage on, and clients ask us to provide more detail on our engagement activities. In this series, we would therefore like to clarify our engagement stance and report back on important stewardship outcomes in this context. We will kick off the \u201cStewardship Principles\u201d with a piece on our engagement approach with oil majors. We believe that these companies can play a constructive role in the energy transition, but they must first provide evidence of their commitment to a low-carbon transition. We will explain our view that divestment from oil majors will have unintended consequences and is unlikely to help decarbonise the economy; it will instead simply displace the problem.

The world must urgently expand its clean energy sources, and we believe divestment would do little to achieve this goal. Key takeaways Access to energy is a fundamental human right: the world needs an orderly and just energy transition supported by all available and emerging technologies In May 2021, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released an ambitious pathway to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, which will be an important reference for our stewardship activities The IEA recognises that oil majors have an important role to play in making its pathway to net zero a reality Divestment from oil majors could have unintended consequences and would be unlikely to help decarbonise the economy, instead simply displacing the problem The relationship between energy and climate change is complex Energy powers progress and is essential to deliver economic development and fundamental human rights: nearly 1 billion people worldwide still do not have access to power simply for cooking and heating. However, population growth and rising economic output are driving up greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, most of which are caused by burning fossil fuels to meet energy needs. It is therefore vital not only to tackle climate change (UN Sustainable Development Goal 13), but also to ensure access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy (UN SDG 7). The IEA\u2019s pathway to net-zero emissions In May 2021, the International Energy Agency (IEA) published its pathway to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. While it is one pathway, rather than the only pathway, this plan is an official IEA blueprint, and as such it has inherent credibility. It will be used by many investors to align their portfolios to a net-zero trajectory and will inform corporations\u2019 plans to reach net zero. The IEA\u2019s document sets out an ambitious and radical blueprint. According to Dr Fatih Birol, IEA executive director, it highlights the \u201cgap between rhetoric and real life\u201d. Without the clear picture of the challenge that the IEA presents, we could end up in a place where companies and portfolios are decarbonising, but the real economy isn\u2019t. Under the IEA net-zero pathway, the global energy system will look completely different by 2050. Global energy demand will be around 8% lower than today, but that energy will power a global economy more than twice as large, with a population 2 billion greater. Almost 90% of electricity will be supplied by renewable energy sources (almost 70% of that figure will come from wind and solar; nuclear power will supply much of the rest). The largest source of energy in the world will be solar power (approximately 20% of supply, up from 1% today). Oil and gas consumption will decline by 75% and 55%, respectively, by 2050. There will be no need for new oil and gas supplies, and the remaining demand will be met by low-cost producers. The market share of OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) nations will climb to 52%, from 37% currently. All remaining coal-fired power plants will use technologies that remove harmful emissions. Overall, the IEA has identified more than 400 milestones to help governments meet their target of keeping global warming within 1.5\u00b0C of pre-industrial levels. Divestment will not decarbonise the economy Divestment will do little to address climate change. It will simply displace the problem. If responsible, active investors divest, potentially less responsible investors (or those that are less exposed to reputational and regulatory pressures) will replace them and continue to fund \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d strategies. Oil and gas majors account for just 12% of global reserves, 15% of production and 10% of estimated emissions from industry operations. The winners from divestment would be state-owned enterprises and national oil companies, which own the bulk of reserves. The benefit in climate terms is unclear. Given the importance of fossil-fuel revenues to their economic growth and social stability, it is debatable whether petrostates will \u201cstrand\u201d their reserves to curb global warming. The IEA pathway suggests that OPEC and other oil-exporting countries will see their governments\u2019 hydrocarbon revenues collapse by 75%. State-owned and national companies led oil production in 2020 1,000 barrels of oil per day Source: Statistica. Most recent available data as at 7 June 2021. It is equally important to influence the pattern of energy demand. More than half the cumulative shift to green energy consumption envisaged in the IEA net-zero pathway is linked to consumer choices. Governments must therefore provide the regulatory and policy frameworks within which companies will formulate their business plans and consumers will change their habits. We need an orderly energy transition supported by current and emerging technologies. Global action on energy efficiency is essential. This critical area can deliver big reductions in emissions while supporting economic growth, reducing air pollution and saving consumers money. Renewables have a major role in combination with natural gas (viewed as a transitional fuel for power generation since it generates half the GHG emissions of coal) and further supported by battery storage. Green hydrogen is a credible option, although it needs demand at greater scale to become economically viable. Sustainable biofuels can provide a substitute for conventional fuels. Carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) is often promoted by the oil and gas industry, as well as energy-intensive sectors such as steel and cement, to reduce GHG emissions. However, CCUS currently lacks political support and social acceptance and requires a pricing signal in the form of a global carbon tax. Nature-based solutions such as reforestation and wetlands can help to avoid, reduce and offset emissions, provided they are independently verified. Oil majors have important skills that can support the transition The IEA also recognises that oil majors have a role to play in making its roadmap a reality.1 They have the global reach, large-scale project management capabilities, government relationships and commercial expertise to manage volatility along integrated energy value chains. European oil majors are competing successfully in renewable energy auctions in partnership with specialist infrastructure investors and adopting ambitious medium and long-term capacity targets. That said, oil majors are generally perceived as being part of the problem. Climate change and finite supplies of scarce resources are two sides of the same coin \u2013 and interlinked We believe it is important to take a nuanced approach that considers and compares GHG emissions from all energy sources across their full lifecycle. Renewable energy is intermittent by nature and must be offset by nuclear (decarbonised but controversial), natural gas or \u2013 in the worst case \u2013 coal. Manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines is carbon-intensive and major questions remain over their decommissioning and recycling. Depletion of natural resources must be carefully monitored, particularly the rare-earth minerals required to make solar panels and batteries. The IEA estimates that annual demand for critical minerals will increase from around 7 million tonnes in 2020 to 42 million tonnes by 2050. It admits that this demand will be much more concentrated as deposits of rare-earth minerals are more geographically focused than fossil fuels. These concentration issues create supply challenges that will need to be addressed. Oil majors must demonstrate their commitment to net zero If we are to believe that oil majors can play a constructive role in the energy transition, they must provide evidence of their commitment to a low-carbon transition, such as: Endorsing the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures Reporting more consistently on climate-related risks Joining the Science-Based Targets initiative and working on the oil and gas decarbonisation framework Committing to reach net zero by 2050 as well as setting interim targets Reporting transparently and credibly on progress in reducing Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions as well as on the most material Scope 3 emissions Addressing methane emissions as a first step to protecting the green credentials of natural gas Monitoring their lobbying activities to ensure that these do not contradict their commitment to a low-carbon transition Building out their new energy businesses In the future, we plan to invite oil majors to put their climate action plans to a shareholder vote. Transparency in this area is critical if investors are to hold them to account on their decarbonisation strategy. How we vote ourselves will depend on the progress of our engagement with the boards. Engagement at the corporate level is essential. But by active stewardship we also mean engagement at the policy level, both individually and collectively.

It has never been more important for investors to play a role in protecting and promoting the world\u2019s natural capital. Key takeaways: Biodiversity is falling fast due mainly to human activity, with little action being taken to tackle the crisis There are reasons for optimism regarding biodiversity, as it\u2019s not too late to tackle the crisis and there is every chance of political consensus for action Investors can play an important part by integrating biodiversity factors into their investment processes and backing innovators While the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP26,1 needs no introduction, its \u201cbiodiversity\u201d equivalent is less known. Yet the UN Biodiversity Conference that began in October 2021 (CBD COP-15)2 is equally important and set new goals for the natural world. At last, the biodiversity crisis is moving out of the shadow of climate change with which it is interlinked. It\u2019s not a moment too soon, as the pressure on our ecosystems is increasing exponentially. Can we imagine our Earth without biodiversity? Indeed, what will happen if we continue to underestimate all that nature provides us with? We believe that climate change and biodiversity loss should be tackled together, and that sustainable finance can help to tackle both. They both classify as \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d \u2013 the nine boundaries that humanity must respect and protect to maintain life on Earth. This article addresses the importance of integrating biodiversity into investment strategies by defining the concept, the extent of biodiversity loss, the associated challenges and the role that investors can play. What is biodiversity? An extensive variety of plant and animal life in the world is considered vital for life as we know it \u2013 a concept that\u2019s known as biodiversity.3 More specifically, this refers to the variety of life on Earth at three interdependent levels: diversity within species (genetic diversity), between species (species diversity) and between ecosystems (ecosystem diversity). Why is biodiversity in crisis? At this point in time, we are in an era of unprecedented biodiversity decline. More than one million species are under threat, plastic pollution threatens about 66% of the marine environment and plant species have declined by about 50%. Human activity is mostly to blame, with the main causes being changes in land and sea use, direct exploitation of organisms through activities such as fishing, widespread pollution, the introduction of invasive alien species and climate change, according to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). We are exploiting Earth\u2019s resources faster than it can replenish them. The good news, though, is that there is still time to reverse the trend for future generations. Essential services for human society Biodiversity is about more than just the species we consider rare or threatened: it encompasses the food we eat, the oxygen we breathe, the medicinal plants that heal us and the clean water we drink. In fact, the continuing loss of biodiversity directly threatens human health and increases the risk of future infectious diseases emerging. We owe everything to nature. More broadly, biodiversity loss is slowing progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), according to the IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.4 Thirty-five out of 44 SDG sub-targets are impacted by biodiversity loss, including those related to poverty, hunger, health, water, cities, climate, oceans and land. Biodiversity is, therefore, not a pure ecological issue \u2013 it has significant social, security and economic implications. The threat to drug discovery Did you know that medicines like aspirin, morphine and penicillin come from wild plants? According to the World Health Organization, about 60% the world\u2019s population depends on traditional medicines and 85% of that medicine originates in plants.5 Indeed, plants have been used to successfully treat human disease for many years, and have yet more potential that has not yet been exploited. So, biodiversity loss directly threatens new drug and treatment discovery. Contributing to climate change mitigation Indeed, the challenges of climate change and biodiversity are intertwined. \u201cWe can\u2019t be net zero unless we are nature positive,\u201d explains David Craig, co-chair of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), which was launched in June 2021. Healthy ecosystems help to mitigate climate change and limit global warming by delivering carbon storage benefits, soaking up greenhouse gas emissions and considerably reducing natural disasters. For example, oceans that cover about 70% of the Earth\u2019s surface make our atmosphere breathable and mitigate global warming by capturing approximately 30% of CO2, absorbing over 90% of excess heat and absorbing up to 50 times more CO2 than our atmosphere.6 The financial cost of less biodiversity Turning to the economy, more than half of the world\u2019s USD 44 trillion GDP depends on nature, according to the World Economic Forum. Consequently, a decline in so-called natural capital risks significant damage to the global economy. From medicines to raw materials, food to tourism \u2013 businesses across all sectors depend directly or indirectly on nature and ecosystem services, as the ravages of the Covid-19 crisis have shown. The increasing pressure on nature directly threatens the continuity of businesses and their value chains, especially for agriculture, forestry, tourism and fishing. Rethinking their role of these sectors, and increasing their resilience, has become essential. By exceeding planetary limits, we are disrupting the functioning of ecosystems, limiting our access to its vital natural services and magnifying our vulnerability to natural disasters. Despite growing awareness of this, the actions taken so far seem out of step with the reality. Progress remains limited. This is partly because people are disconnected from nature and do not recognise its value. Scientists have sounded the alarm for decades, but the biodiversity crisis remains largely underestimated. Biodiversity is a complex concept; many people do not understand how human activities directly impact our natural capital and, therefore, are not concerned by the extent of its loss. A key challenge: measuring ecosystem services As the saying goes: you treasure what you can measure. But the measurement of \u201cecosystem services\u201d provided by biodiversity is challenging. While there are many proposed indicators and variables, there\u2019s a lack of consensus about how to put a \u201cprice label\u201d on nature\u2019s services and the cost of biodiversity loss. Agreement is important, however, as it would help corporates to make biodiversity commitments and inform investors in their decision-making. The TNFD\u2019s launch in the summer of 2021 marks an important milestone, as it establishes an international reporting framework that will allow investors to better understand nature-related risks, impacts and opportunities. Through its framework, the TNFD is expected to replicate the success of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which has successfully promoted the issue of climate-related risks in finance. Expecting a coordinated policy response Despite all international initiatives and accumulated scientific knowledge, the world community has failed to address the biodiversity crisis. Simply put, the topic has not captured the same political attention as climate. Yet this is changing as awareness grows, especially following the failure to meet the 2010 Aichi targets.7 As a result, a coordinated policy response is expected. We think policy makers should present a clear roadmap with achievable targets. It is, therefore, essential to support an ambitious political agreement at COP-15 for biodiversity, where the draft of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework8 should be adopted. The framework proposes four goals to achieve a 2050 shared vision of \u201cliving in harmony with nature\u201d and is expected to provide the level of ambition needed to halt biodiversity\u2019s decline. Aligning climate and biodiversity ambitions through investment How investors can engage with companies to influence change\u2026 Investors have an opportunity to lead the transition towards a nature-positive system. As risks associated with biodiversity degradation can directly reduce financial returns, we believe that it is key to consider biodiversity-related aspects in the investment process. This can be done by ensuring that companies formalise commitments to protecting biodiversity and apply them consistently in their operations. We consider it important to apply exclusion criteria early in the investment process for severe controversies, using the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) framework,9 and to engage with investee companies when necessary. Responsible investors can require more disclosure from companies about their impact on natural resources. Although it is still difficult to get information, doing so is essential for raising companies\u2019 awareness of the need to protect ecosystems. With planetary boundaries as one of our core sustainability themes, Allianz Global Investors is committed to increasing our engagement on biodiversity in parallel with the ongoing developments related to data availability. \u2026and how they can invest for impact There is also an opportunity to back the innovative companies protecting biodiversity. This includes solutions for carbon sequestration, the circular economy or regenerative agriculture. The UN Convention on Biological Diversity, in the new global biodiversity framework, has highlighted that \u201cadequate financial resources to implement the framework are available and deployed, progressively closing the financing gap up to at least USD 700 billion per year by 2030.\u201d Additionally, impact investing10 has an important role to play in investing to protect biodiversity, not least as financial flows are redirected away from harmful hydrocarbon and agriculture subsidies, estimated at USD 500 billion per year.11 Urgent rallying cry Awareness of biodiversity's crisis is finally growing. As scientists have warned for many years, the challenges of climate change and biodiversity are interlinked. Both represent threats to the wellbeing of human society that must be tackled urgently. As investors everywhere consider the question of how to invest sustainably, biodiversity has an important part to play in the answer. Protecting and nurturing the Earth's natural resources is clearly essential for the environment and society.

Investments in innovative companies that produce clean energy from sustainable sources, or manufacture highly elaborate industrial filtration systems, can help to address the most pressing air-pollution-related challenges Tackling air pollution with sustainable investments \u201cAir pollution is an invisible killer that we may face on a simple walk home or even in our home.\u201d 1 Together with the mostly uncontrolled burning of agricultural and municipal waste, the combustion and evaporation of fossil fuels \u2013 mainly from power plants, industry and vehicle engines \u2013 represent the main source of polluted air. Sources of some key air pollutants Source: International Energy Agency 2016. Download full infographic Fossil fuel combustion also marks the starting point of a \u201cvicious circle\u201d that leads to continuous production of particulate matter and greenhouse gases (GhGs). Every day this loop affects billions of people globally, as they go about their usual outdoor activities, constantly exposed to health-threatening microscopic \u2013 and hence invisible \u2013 air pollutants (fine particulate matter, PM2.5). Download full article The \"vicious circle\" of air pollution Source: https://aqli.epic.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AQLI_2021-Report.EnglishGlobal.pdf Download full infographic But the invisible killer is also lurking indoors, causing millions of premature deaths a year, and is primarily caused by activities such as cooking and heating over open fires with solid fuels like wood and other biomass-based fuels.2 How air pollution affects our health Temporary effects of air pollution on our health include eye, nose and throat irritation, as well as wheezing, coughing, chest tightness and breathing difficulties. Long-term exposure to air pollution may cause cancer and damage to the immune system. It can severely affect neurological, reproductive and respiratory systems, and lead to an increased likelihood of cardiovascular diseases. Poor air quality increases the risk of heart attack, and can worsen existing lung problems, such as asthma. In extreme cases, air pollution may even cause death. Conversely, a reduction in air pollution in line with the WHO guidelines could lead to a prolongation of the average global life expectancy by 2.2 years.3 Growing urbanisation as a primary source of dirty air Estimates suggest that by 2050 around two-thirds of the global population (i.e., 6.7 billion of approx. 10 billion people) will be living in urban settings. Considering that cities already generate 70% of global carbon emissions, and consume two-thirds of the world\u2019s energy,4 the significance of fostering concepts for a greener and more sustainable urbanisation, hand in hand with more sustainable construction and transportation systems, becomes even more obvious and urgent. According to recent studies, residents of the most polluted areas of the world could see their life expectancy cut short by five years, or even more.5 1. Outdoor and indoor air pollution of buildings The rapid increase in an urbanised population is accompanied by a growing need for housing and commercial buildings. During their whole lifecycle, such constructions have an environmental impact that contributes to air pollution. Processes like excavation, brickmaking and transportation of construction waste lead to higher emissions,6 and consequently to a higher concentration of particulate pollutants. Studies suggest that more efficient brick-firing can lessen the pollutant emissions by over 90%.7 From an indoor-air-pollution perspective, natural or passive ventilation of buildings favours the ingress of polluted air. With deteriorating outdoor air, and with rising temperatures due to climate change, it is expected that by 2050 the global energy demand from air conditioners will triple. This will lead to an even higher demand for energy and have significant impact on global air quality. Considering that indoor air pollution is responsible for the deaths of 4.3 million people annually,8 appropriate heat-trapping and energy-efficient filtration systems can help to not only reduce emissions and energy usage, but also lower the overall operating costs for end-users. 2. Mobility and transportation In order to provide healthier air quality in urban settings, investment is needed to \u201cde-carbonise\u201d public transportation systems and individual mobility. Although several cities and governments are gradually reshaping the future of transportation by: incentivising and subsiding the production of EVs, and a comprehensive charging infrastructure. turning their public transportation fleets carbon-neutral traffic-related air pollution of urban centres is still a significant contributor to the emission of particulate matter.9 Banning gas and diesel vehicles from city centres, or even banning their sale and at the same time boosting EV or hydrogen-fueled cars, is undoubtedly a step in the right direction to fighting air pollution. Accordingly, economic or regulatory backdrops serve as catalysts, as they support the growth and market penetration of carbon-neutral mobility. Still, more action is needed, to at least meet the corresponding SDG targets 3.9.1 (reduction in deaths and illnesses from air pollution), 7.1.2 (access to clean energy in homes) and 11.6.2 (reducing the environmental impact of cities through improved air quality). The cost side of air pollution In 2018, air pollution triggered a staggering cost of USD 2.9 trillion to the global economy, corresponding to 3.3 % of the world's GDP. In the same year, unhealthy air quality caused 1.8 billion days of work absences worldwide.10 Other estimates suggest that air pollution accounts for USD 5 trillion, annually, in welfare costs for the global economy. 11 The Economic Burden of Air Pollution Source: Statista, Greenpeace, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air Download full infographic Comparing these enormous costs resulting from air pollution with the investments aimed at mitigating the impact of this \u201cinvisible killer\u201d on human health, there is an evident imbalance. This is the case not only when it comes to private funding vs. investments needed, but also with regard to global development aid. The disparity becomes even clearer when looking at the analysis \u201cThe state of global air quality funding 2021\u201d.12 According to this report, between 2015 and 2020 only 0.7% of total development finance was spent on air pollution-related projects, with most of the funds coming from multilateral development banks. With approximately USD 6 billion, China was the largest recipient of funding linked to improving air quality, followed by Mongolia, the Philippines and Pakistan. India, although accounting for over 1 million premature deaths annually from air pollution, ranked eighth. In a nutshell, countries in developing markets that are disproportionately affected by air pollution, and shouldering heavy economic burdens, have the least access to affordable health services and financial resources to protect them from pollutants. Allianz Global Investors identifies innovators to address air pollution While the combustion of fossil fuel is still the main source of air pollution, the transition to a fully carbon-free power supply and carbon-neutral mobility is well under way to help address this. To accelerate the transition, and address air pollution-related challenges, Allianz Global Investors identifies innovators providing electricity from renewable energy sources, and industrial filtration, that meet the highest requirements. We invest in key enablers that manufacture emissions-control catalysts for power generation \u2013 as well as dust, fume and mist collectors, and air filtration systems used in industrial gas turbines. We also continue to look at companies that produce automotive catalysts used to clean the exhaust gases from internal combustion engines, and materials for long-lasting lithium-ion batteries to pave the way for a greener mobility. Investments in such companies can help to redirect capital towards more sustainable solutions that contribute to improved outdoor and indoor air quality and mitigate the impact of the \u201cinvisible killer\u201d air pollution on human health and on global economic output.

It has never been more important for investors to play a role in protecting and promoting the world\u2019s natural capital. Key takeaways: Biodiversity is falling fast due mainly to human activity, with little action being taken to tackle the crisis There are reasons for optimism regarding biodiversity, as it\u2019s not too late to tackle the crisis and there is every chance of political consensus for action Investors can play an important part by integrating biodiversity factors into their investment processes and backing innovators Load More "

        "content": " Active is: Thinking long term, today German elections 2021: a three-party coalition? by Hans-J\u00f6rg Naumer | 27/09/2021 Summary The results of the Bundestag elections kick off a potentially extended period of negotiations to form a new government. The parties differ on topics such as fiscal policy and climate change that will be critical to those discussions and the final shape of Germany\u2019s government. Key takeaways Early results in the German federal elections suggest that a three-party coalition is the likely outcome The process of forming a coalition government may take some time, and issues such as fiscal policy and climate change will be at the fore of negotiations While the DAX has typically shrugged off the impact of national elections, any prolonged period of uncertainty will likely increase volatility in local equity markets As the dust settles on the Bundestag elections, Germany appears to be heading for a three-party coalition. Based on the parties\u2019 share of the vote, there are several potential \u201cconstellations\u201d, with two named after the traditional colours of each party: The \u201ctraffic light\u201d coalition: the SPD, the Greens and the FDP (red-green-yellow) The \u201cJamaica\u201d coalition: the CDU/CSU, the Greens and the FDP (black-green-yellow) Grand coalition: the CDU/CSU and the SPD A grand coalition, which according to the latest projections would hold 402 out of 735 seats, is the least likely outcome. The Federal President would have to insist that the parties reach an agreement to prevent new elections \u2013 if a majority government was not achieved. In any case, the leaders of the CDU/CSU and the SPD have already claimed the office of chancellor for themselves, further reducing the odds of such an alliance. Since the Greens and the FDP are crucial to any coalition, but there are many differences in their programmes (especially regarding fiscal policy), the process of forming a government could take weeks. The two most likely coalitions are: \u201cTraffic light\u201d: red-green-yellow (416 of 735 seats) Of the various potential outcomes, a coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) would have the most comfortable majority, with 416 out of 735 seats. Such an alliance would not be easy, however. It is true that the SPD and the Greens have large overlaps in economic policy, but state interventionism and the desire for more redistribution are opposed to the economic liberalism of the FDP, which relies heavily on tax cuts. \u201cJamaica\u201d: black-green-yellow (406 of 735 seats) A coalition of the CDU/CSU, the Greens and the FDP would have a somewhat less comfortable majority. This is the most desirable arrangement from the point of view of the conservative parties (CDU/CSU) and the liberals (FDP). The CDU\u2019s candidate for chancellor, Armin Laschet, is already governing with the FDP in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. He has repeatedly expressed a preference for this coalition model. Likewise, the Liberals will probably favour this type of arrangement. In the past, the Conservatives and the Greens have also toyed with the idea of working together in a so-called \u201cblack-green\u201d coalition. However, this ambition is not shared by the majority of the Green Party. The top candidates from the Greens (Annalena Baerbock) and FDP (Christian Lindner) have both already announced that they want to talk first before they receive an invitation to formal coalition talks from Olaf Scholz (SPD) and Armin Laschet (CDU), respectively. It is conceivable that they will come to an agreement primarily on questions of climate protection and fiscal policy. This could make a Jamaica coalition easier. This coalition might find an agreement, eg, by raising the national CO2 target and bringing the CO2 price increases forward from 2025 to 2023. The Greens could also be offered concessions on taxes. Implications for equity markets Typically, the impact of elections on markets has been short-lived \u2013 as the chart shows. But is that true this time around? We analysed how the DAX performed immediately before and after every German federal election since the index was established. With the possible exception of elections in the 1980s, the index has been barely affected by Bundestag elections: during the three-month periods before and after elections, performance has hardly deviated from the MSCI Europe or MSCI World indices. The economy, monetary policy and overall global sentiment on capital markets are likely to be the dominant medium and long-term factors for this election as well. This is hardly surprising as the issues at play in the Bundestag elections are mostly of national significance. Larger or enduring effects are therefore unlikely at the international level, particularly as a coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the far-left \u201cDie Linke\u201d party can be ruled out. The latter party has previously campaigned to abolish NATO. That said, any prolonged period of coalition-forming will likely increase volatility in the German markets, as markets dislike uncertainty. Global trends have been bigger drivers of Germany\u2019s markets than Bundestag elections Index performance +/- 3 months of Bundestag elections (daily data, returns in local currency, index = 0 on day of election) Source: Refinitiv Datastream, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 21 September 2021. DAX is an unmanaged index of 40 German companies trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. MSCI Europe an unmanaged index that represents the performance of large and mid-cap equities across 15 developed countries in Europe. MSCI World is an unmanaged index that captures large- and mid-cap representation across 23 developed-market countries. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Climate concerns For all parties, the climate is at the top of the agenda and the issue itself is not new. Both the Paris climate agreement and the EU Green Deal were brokered during the tenure of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government. Germany has successfully reduced its CO2 emissions by 37% from the baseline year of 1990 and the country\u2019s emission intensity, which refers to carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product, has fallen to one-fifth of 1960 levels. The question in relation to the climate is what approach should be taken to solve the problem of rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Germany, with a global market share of 14% of environmental technology, is well placed to become the leading international exporter of zero-carbon products. To achieve this, however, the right conditions will have to be created to spur the necessary investments. Whereas the CDU and SPD want to stick to the existing roadmap of reaching carbon neutrality by 2045, the Greens want to reach this goal earlier. The Greens also want every piece of legislation to be reviewed for its impact on climate change before it can come into force. In addition, their plans include the creation of a new climate ministry with a right to veto any bills. The CO2 price is key to achieving climate targets for the CDU. But the SPD and the Greens merely regard it as one tool among many. The CDU would like to see a \u201ccomprehensive European emissions trading scheme with a uniform pricing system integrated into a global framework\u201d. It strongly favours free-market solutions, while the other two parties advocate a policy of greater regulatory intervention. In this respect, Armin Laschet frequently stresses the importance of Germany being a \u201czero-carbon industrial powerhouse\u201d. Sectors whose impact on the climate is particularly significant will be paying close attention to certain decisions, for example on whether coal-fired power stations will be decommissioned earlier than planned. Implications for the European Union As far as European affairs are concerned, Olaf Scholz (SPD) is positioning himself in favour of a fiscal union. He wants to make the Maastricht criteria more flexible. His plans also call for the EU to have its own financial resources, which would be raised, for example, by taxing large digital corporations, imposing a CO2 levy on imported goods, and generating new revenues from emissions trading. The SPD\u2019s manifesto also proposes a Europe-wide approach to unemployment benefits. Under Armin Laschet (CDU), these plans would have little chance of being realised. Shape of German fiscal policy A government influenced by the CDU/CSU and the FDP will pay more attention to compliance with the debt brake \u2013 Germany\u2019s so-called \u201cblack zero\u201d rule. But even in a traffic-light coalition, the FDP is likely to try to prevent stronger debt financing. While the CDU/CSU and the FDP refuse to raise taxes, the SPD and the Greens have tax increases and additional new taxes on the agenda. With the participation of the FDP in government, any introduction of new taxes and tax increases would be much more difficult.

It represents a fast-growing and important asset class that facilitates positive change for the planet while resonating with a growing investor base. Key takeaways Impact investing, which seeks a measurable social or environment benefit as well as an investment return, is among the fastest-growing asset classes; interest has accelerated due to the Covid-19 pandemic Investors shouldn\u2019t need to trade financial returns for impact \u2013 in fact, greater quantification of impact returns could help support financial returns An emerging body of industry standards for impact investing is enabling more accurate measurement and reporting, while growing numbers of investment options \u2013 across both public and private markets \u2013 are making impact investing more accessible With the rising frequency of major environmental events and social movements \u2013 from floods to wildfires, from #MeToo to Black Lives Matter \u2013 the objective of making the world a better place has gone from personal choice to global necessity. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, with its \u201ccode red\u201d warning, represents another urgent wake-up call. Moreover, the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed some profound social inequalities, and many investors have become increasingly aware of the role their capital can and should play in addressing these imbalances. In developing countries alone, the pandemic is thought to have magnified the existing funding shortfall needed to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.1 Against the backdrop of Covid, the previous estimate of USD 2.5 trillion a year required by developing countries to keep them on track to meet these goals increased by a further USD 1.7 trillion in 2020. In terms of action on climate change, 2021 could be a milestone year. Beginning with the return of the US to the Paris Accord, the year has been characterised by extreme weather events and will culminate in COP26 \u2013 arguably the most important meeting yet of major nations on the climate topic. While investors have become increasingly aware of the role their capital should play in addressing environmental and social concerns, the challenge has been to combine the twin goals of \u201cdoing good\u201d and \u201cearning a return\u201d in a single investment. Impact investing offers an answer by providing a credible and scalable pathway to balancing a targeted measurable and beneficial environmental or social impact on the one hand, with a financial return on the other. As a result, it has transitioned from the realm of direct private-market investments into a significant and expanding market segment. Where investors previously thought only in terms of risk and reward, they can now add a third dimension of oversight to their portfolios: impact. More opportunities are driving growth in impact investing According to a recent survey focused on private markets, impact investing currently accounts for just 0.5% of global assets and USD 715 billion of assets under management.2 But it is growing at pace: the volume of impact-oriented investments rose by 77% annually between 2017 and 2019.3 The growth in impact investing has in part been driven by an increase in the investment options across the various impact asset classes. Whether through public or private instruments, investors can gain exposure through fixed income, equities, real estate, infrastructure and other real assets, and private equity and venture capital investment vehicles. How the investment industry makes sure impact investments deliver The future growth trajectory of impact investing depends on the industry demonstrating where these investments are being directed and why \u2013 and how the impact can be measured and reported. Debate continues about what constitutes an acceptable or competitive rate of return from these investments (see separate section at end, entitled \u201cImpact investing: what constitutes an acceptable return?\u201d). Consensus has also emerged that impact investments should contribute to at least one, and preferably several, of the 17 UN SDGs. The involvement of the private sector will be critical to helping achieve these goals, not least because of the increasing shortfall in investment capital needed to finance the SDGs. To assist with framing impact investments, the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) has outlined several requirements (see table). As the investment industry coalesces around these standards, an increasing number of private-market participants are developing initiatives around minimum requirements, and identifying best practices and audit processes for impact projects and investments. Examples include the Operating Principles for Impact Management and the Impact Management Project.4, 5 Raising the bar on transparency and reporting can help the industry deliver on its promise and insulate itself from accusations of \u201cimpact washing\u201d, where funds make claims that are not substantiated by any relevant and demonstrable positive impact. In addition, monitoring the progress of investments in achieving impact against expectations helps improve decision-making and delivery. Global Impact Investing Network standards for impact investments Intentionality There must be a dedicated intention to achieve a clearly defined impact Causality The ability to demonstrate a positive effect from the investment (GIIN provides different levels of direct causality) Measurability If the desired impact is to be fully or partially achieved, this must be measured by a clearly defined set of key performance indicators (KPIs) Reporting The impact must be reported periodically, regularly and transparently Source: Global Impact Investing Network. The breadth and depth of impact is developing very quickly The notion of \u201cco-investing\u201d with sovereign and corporate entities to support transition strategies can be integral to impact investing. An example is the growth of debt that carries an ESG (environmental, social and governance) label \u2013 an asset class that is estimated to have topped USD 2 trillion in the second quarter of 2021.6 The majority of this debt derives from green, social and sustainability (GSS) bonds, where proceeds are directed towards specific projects with an ongoing audit requirement, but these bonds are complemented by other structures. Impact investing can also extend to blended finance, where investment from both institutions and philanthropic funds can be combined to create opportunities for commercial investors. Sovereign nations are also getting in on the act, where impact investing can complement initiatives such as the World Bank\u2019s International Development Association lending to low-income economies.7 Earlier this year, Benin issued Africa\u2019s first social bond in the international markets, raising money to broaden access to drinking water for its population of 12 million. From identifying risks to creating solutions The best-in-class investment approach8 is a well-recognised and accepted way of directing capital towards companies with above-peer or better-than-average sustainability profiles. However, this framework is still heavily skewed towards avoiding those with less favourable sustainability profiles, rather than prioritising those geared towards new technologies and services that provide solutions. Impact investing touches on this notion both in terms of targeting solutions and in terms of the opportunity set. Many \u201chandprint\u201d opportunities, which seek to positively contribute to sustainability objectives, revolve around new technologies and services that seek to shift the mechanics of our daily lives fundamentally. These are often in an early stage of development, an area that has typically been the preserve of venture capital and private equity. Nevertheless, there is a trend both to develop these solutions and to scale them for wider applications that can influence sectors and geographies. Impact investing\u2019s reach into both public and private domains means it can cover the full breadth of the opportunity set. Its success is in connecting to the changing nature of client demands by articulating a three-dimensional perspective \u2013 incorporating risk, return and impact \u2013 and demonstrating how finance can lead to positive societal outcomes. Impact investing: what constitutes an acceptable return? As impact investing\u2019s investment options grow, attention is turning to the second goal of impact \u2013 \u201cearning a return\u201d \u2013 and specifically what constitutes an acceptable or competitive rate of return. Views on this question vary and have arguably become more diverse in recent years. An underlying premise of investing for many is a \u201crisk-adjusted financial return\u201d. But how can the return be adjusted to account for non-financial risks \u2013 and can the addition of a non-financial return be quantified to complement a financial return? The finance industry continues to refine the methodology for integrating ESG or sustainability factors into investment decisions, but formally integrating these into valuation models for investments has presented a challenge. Investors have historically focused on cyclicality and longer-term secular trends, but we see an increased focus on structural trends \u2013 ie, how a sector or company is aligned to changing expectations in the modern economy. We expect structural positioning to be a key factor for valuations. A company or sector\u2019s positioning in the modern economy, coupled with changing stakeholder expectations, could have a significant impact on assumptions regarding terminal growth rates, terminal margin rates, weighted average cost of capital and, ultimately, access to liquidity. We use the term \u201cstakeholder\u201d since it better encompasses the full breadth of those assessing behavioural biases. Simply put, if an entity\u2019s potential investor universe is too narrow, its financing options will likely be constrained and the associated cost of capital higher. The flip side is that those sectors, companies and projects geared to providing solutions will likely benefit from improved perceptions. By providing access to a broader audience, impact investing can help increase their financing options, lower their financing costs and enhance their overall financial viability. Measuring the return of an impact Work on calculating the value of a non-financial return has led to metrics such as a social return on investment (SROI) or impact multiple of money (IMM).9 Once the targeted impact outcome is identified \u2013 along with the relevance of a product or project to that outcome \u2013 it is possible to estimate the economic value of those outcomes with appropriate risk adjustments, and thereby generate an estimated terminal value. Then, based on the degree of risk associated with the project or product, an appropriate discount rate can be applied to calculate the estimated social or impact return on the investment. We expect this area of research to develop further. The case for market \u2013 not maximised \u2013 returns Assuming one can accurately calculate and attribute both the financial and the non-financial returns of an investment, there remains the divisive topic of the balance between the two. We disagree that there must be a trade-off between impact and financial returns. In fact, as non-financial returns become an increasingly important factor, they could provide a strong technical tailwind. However, it may be difficult to target maximised rather than market rates of return. The difference lies in the associated risk attribution and adjustments tied to the expected rate of return. As such, fast-changing perceptions and attribution of sustainability risk factors could swiftly impact expected returns. We like the notion of sustainability requiring an improving positive \u201chandprint\u201d coupled with the lowering of a \u201cfootprint\u201d.10 The more the impact investment industry can qualify and quantify non-financial returns, the more likely these could not only complement, but also support, financial returns.

Typically the constituents of an investable universe will be measured against specific ESG metrics and a relative ranking of these constituents will be made. A threshold will be defined at and above which constituents will be considered to demonstrate \u201cbest in class\u201d characteristics. 9 Source: Harvard Business Review. 10 The term handprint was first used in 2007 at UNESCO\u2019s 4th International Conference on Environmental Education, but has since been referenced in many initiatives, including the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development in 2009. The handprint is the wider environmental and social impact that a company can achieve outside of its footprint. It is possible to reduce the footprint by addressing the quantity and scope of consumption, for example through selective exclusions or disciplined ESG integration. A positive handprint can be achieved by investing in key enablers of long-term solutions to support a more sustainable way of living beyond our consumption (SDGs, strategic focus and a scalable reach). Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested. Emerging markets may be more volatile, less liquid, less transparent, and subject to less oversight, and values may fluctuate with currency exchange rates. Investments in alternative assets presents the opportunity for significant losses including losses which exceed the initial amount invested. Some investments in alternative assets have experienced periods of extreme volatility and in general, are not suitable for all investors. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategies consider factors beyond traditional financial information to select securities or eliminate exposure which could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks.

        "content": " Addressing executive pay in the US technology sector by David Shammai | 25/11/2021 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Listed US technology companies often continue to be run by their founders, who also retain large or majority shareholdings. This situation can lead to questions over their compensation policies. Regardless of the type of ownership, concerns are exacerbated when boards fail to read the expectations of shareholders, evidenced by poor outcomes at shareholder meetings, and this requires active investors to engage directly with the board. Key takeaways A clear alignment between management and shareholder interests is essential, irrespective of the company\u2019s ownership structure We see an increased risk that governance weaknesses in founder-controlled technology companies may lead to the adoption of compensation schemes that fall short of the alignment we seek Low level of support for the advisory vote on pay is a governance red flag and in some cases was followed by share price underperformance Executive pay controversies can harm workforce perceptions of the company, a material risk factor for technology companies facing competitive employment markets Engagement with companies can provide more detail on their compensation structures and the reasons for their adoption Where questions remain, we will continue to engage and set out our case for change This year\u2019s US AGM season threw up a growing number of cases where companies failed to win shareholder support for their advisory vote on pay. Research shows that 2.6% of AGM votes on pay went against management, up from 2.1% last year1. And many of these expressions of dissent took place at technology company AGMs. We view these instances as red flags, which in some cases were followed by share price underperformance. This is not surprising; the board\u2019s failure to read the expectations of their company\u2019s largest shareholders could be indicative of broader governance blind spots. Source: ISS Governance \u2013 2021 Proxy season review, United States compensation At Allianz Global Investors, our approach to questions around executive pay is shaped by our Global Corporate Governance Guidelines2. The fundamental premise is that the structure and level of executive pay should be designed to promote the long-term success of the company. This entails the board having a clear ongoing apprehension of the expectations of shareholders. The guidelines detail the issues we expect boards and compensation committees to consider, such as the use of share-based compensation to help align the interests of management and shareholders. We support long-term incentive plans that set demanding, multi-year targets and encourage outperformance. From governance guidelines to practice The public equity market in the US is more dominated by large institutional shareholders than other regions3. Interestingly, it also exhibits the least concentrated ownership among the OECD economies, with ownership of each company typically spread across a broader number of shareholders. This means that our policy can be readily applied to the US equity market. However, in this context the technology sector is an outlier within the US; it has emerged in recent decades and many of its companies are still run by their founders. Among more recently established technology companies that have chosen to go public, the founders often retain ownership and voting control4. In this, the technology sector differs markedly from others, where founding entrepreneurs are no longer significant shareholders in companies with previously concentrated ownership (eg, multi-generational, family-controlled businesses). Alignment in founder-run companies is not guaranteed We recognise that founders can be an integral part of a company\u2019s investment case. However, founder-run or controlled companies face a variety of corporate governance risks, ranging from skewed control and ownership structures to issues over the balance and composition of the board. One high-profile consequence can be that compensation and long-term incentive structures do not align management\u2019s interests closely enough with those of minority shareholders. Pay is not the only way to ensure an alignment of interests between management and shareholders. Another key factor is the board, which provides checks and balances to prevent abuse of power by the CEO and management and hold them accountable for performance. The effectiveness of the board is, therefore, another factor we consider when assessing executive compensation. For example, seeking to establish the robustness of the pay-setting process, we consider whether the board \u2013 and critically the compensation committee \u2013 has sufficient level of independence. We apply our Global Corporate Governance Guidelines equivalently in all cases, seeking a clear alignment between management and shareholders, irrespective of the ownership structure. Ad-hoc research provided to us recently finds variations between sub-segments of the technology sector, with some founder CEOs receiving compensation in line with peers, while in other cases there are material differences. An important consideration for us as investors is the extent to which management performance is reflected in share price performance. Our experience so far does not indicate any correlation between compensation structures and inadequate alignment of management and shareholder interests; there is no particular feature of pay in founder-managed companies which makes them more or less prone to poor alignment. There are instances of founder CEOs who choose to receive below-market pay, in some cases nil, suggesting that they see themselves primarily as shareholders in the company. In other cases, we observe that founders\u2019 pay is in line with, or sometimes well above, market rates. Hence, in situations where we have questions about the degree of alignment between management and shareholders, we may decide to engage with the board to gain a clearer understanding of the details of these compensation structures and how they reflect performance. The results of this engagement may be an overriding factor in determining whether we accept management\u2019s voting recommendations on pay. Engagement in pursuit of deeper insight A well-designed executive compensation scheme should support the alignment of management, primarily with shareholders but also with key stakeholders5. In the case of companies run by the founding individual, there tends to be a substantial or controlling shareholding. Where we question the appropriateness of compensation levels or structures, we engage with the board to better understand the rationale and long-term strategy behind compensation schemes. As an active asset manager, we are keen to differentiate between high and misaligned levels of compensation. We are comfortable supporting high levels of compensation where the company has performed well, and we consider its strategy to have positioned it positively for the long term. In our engagement, there are several areas we regularly explore to gain insights that will supplement our analysis of published corporate reports. These include: The rationale behind the compensation policy or specific Compensation Committee decisions. The alignment of executive compensation trends with those of the workforce, which can provide insights into the organisation and identify potential areas of internal friction. The board\u2019s perspective on the company\u2019s social profile. Does it have an inclusive approach to all stakeholders (eg, employees, customers, local external stakeholders)? Management responsiveness to shareholder and stakeholder views and feedback. How regular, extensive and meaningful is the outreach? Engagement in pursuit of change Should the answers to our questions highlight risk factors or areas for improvement, we would continue our dialogue to focus on these issues. Our policy clearly explains our favoured governance structures, especially in cases involving companies that have a large base of institutional investors and are run by professional managers with small shareholdings. We will engage with management teams to discuss how they could amend compensation structures to be more aligned with our guidelines. In discussing the design of long-term incentive schemes, we may encourage companies to6: Reduce reliance on share options \u2013 these can provide an asymmetrical and geared incentive versus long-term shareholdings or strategy. This means that although their value is linked with upward share price movement, their economic value grows at a faster rate than the corresponding share price growth. Additionally, while shareholders may experience loss, recipients of share options can only experience an upside. Extend performance stretch targets \u2013 high levels of compensation should not be delivered unless linked to outperformance against peers or expectations, not business-as-usual. Reduce or eliminate equity awards that are not subject to performance criteria or thresholds. Avoid judging performance over periods shorter than three years. Conclusion: we will deepen our engagement with technology companies We have identified technology as a particular segment of the US market where we believe there is scope for improved compensation structures and will continue to engage with several of our investee companies on this topic. We will use this engagement process to make clear our expectations and the basis on which we will vote in next year\u2019s AGM season.

Such discussion is vital to help fix some of the perceived flaws in a tool that will have a role to play in the net-zero drive. Key takeaways Carbon offsets allow governments and companies to offset their carbon emissions and can be mandatory or voluntary. Voluntary carbon offsets (VCOs) are booming as part of rising net zero commitments: the market is estimated to top USD 1 billion in 2021. Debate about how to strengthen offsetting ecosystems is vital amid criticism that offsets provide a licence to pollute by enabling entities to focus on cutting net \u2013 rather than gross \u2013 emissions. A rulebook for carbon markets was agreed at COP26, marking a significant step in the development of the burgeoning carbon credits industry. Load More "

An increasing (urban) population with a growing demand for food, climate change causing more extreme weather and an aging infrastructure are the main drivers for water scarcity and water stress. Water scarcity is a significant barrier to economic growth, not only in already water-scarce regions Key takeaways Physical and economic water scarcity have both drastic societal and economic effects An increasing (urban) population with a growing demand for food, climate change causing more extreme weather and an aging infrastructure are the main drivers for water scarcity and water stress Water scarcity is a significant barrier to economic growth, not only in already water-scarce regions Corporates are facing heightened risks in absence of adaptive measures or from lacking investments in addressing water risks Investments in innovators offering water-efficiency solutions can help to address water scarcity contributing to protect the world\u2019s food supply The water scarcity challenge and the cost of inaction Throughout 2021 the world was plagued with disastrous weather events, from hurricanes and flooding to unprecedented droughts. This severe weather disrupted access to clean water supply, negatively impacting the livelihoods of many communities around the world. For example, Texas experienced infrastructure failure following severe and unusual winter weather, while Taiwan experienced its worst drought in 56 years, which posed challenges for semiconductor production. Communities in Germany and China also faced challenges, as the nations were victims of life-threatening floods. While the water scarcity challenge has been worsening, these severe weather events have further highlighted the need for urgent action to address inadequate infrastructure, adapt drainage systems, and enhance water-use efficiency. Together with the mostly uncontrolled burning of agricultural and municipal waste, the combustion and evaporation of fossil fuels \u2013 mainly from power plants, industry and vehicle engines \u2013 represent the main source of polluted air. More than a billion people live in water-scarce regions, and as many as 3.5 billion could face water scarcity by 20251 Water scarcity \u2013 a definition Water scarcity refers to a physical shortage, or lack of access to renewable water supplies (economic water scarcity). This is typically tied to lack of infrastructure, or a failure to secure an adequate water supply.2 That said, wherever water demand outpaces water supply, or infrastructure is aging or lacking, a region may face the risk of water scarcity. As demand for water continues to exceed water supply, more and more of the world is likely to experience water-related challenges. For example, 20% of global GDP is already produced in regions experiencing water scarcity.3 Download full article Source: https://www.wri.org/insights/it-could-only-cost-1-gdp-solve-global-water-crises Download full infographic Water scarcity drivers Water supply disruption The increase in demand is not the only driver of water scarcity, as challenges with water supply and water infrastructure can also play a role. For example, as climate change continues to drive more extreme weather, such as severe floods or hurricanes, existing water infrastructure will be put to the test, often resulting in failures. These failures will further drive water scarcity, as freshwater resources will not be effectively distributed, and the quality of the freshwater is likely to be negatively impacted. Additionally, changing weather patterns also impact levels of precipitation, as well as the form of precipitation. For example, whether precipitation comes in the form of snow or rain determines how long the resource can be preserved, and when it can be utilised. In regions where snow is usually the dominant form, yet rain is experienced, the freshwater resource cannot be effectively preserved for use in the drier spring and summer months. An ever-growing (urban) population In parallel to water scarcity triggered by climate change, population growth is contributing to a growing water-supply demand imbalance. Additionally, as incomes rise in emerging economies, a higher disposable income will result in lifestyle changes which impact the level of water demanded. For example, as more people can afford to live middle-class lifestyles, water demand will increase to support a more water-intensive diet or overall lifestyle. Additionally, many of these populations are gravitating toward cities which are already facing water scarcity. According to research, in 2016 around 933 million urban residents globally lived in water-scarce regions. By 2050, this number could double, reaching between 1.693 and 2.373 billion (35\u201351%).4 Water use has been growing globally at more than twice the rate of population increase over the last century, and an increasing number of regions are reaching the limit at which water services can be sustainably delivered, especially in arid regions.5 Water scarcity triggers profound environmental and societal disruptions Water scarcity has far-reaching societal and policy implications. It not only puts millions of people at risk of displacement, but also triggers bloody \u201cwater wars\u201d, for example between herdsmen and crop farmers, or between users in urban and rural areas \u2013 especially during droughts, when water normally used for irrigation is diverted for urban use. This, in turn, can lead to significantly reduced agricultural output, with cascading effects on food security. Worldwide, water-related conflicts are growing6 in parallel with an intensifying water demand. According to recent estimates, by 2050 the requirement for water could increase by 55%.7 \u201cDrought is on the verge of becoming the next pandemic, and there is no vaccine to cure it.\u201d (Mami Mizutori, UN Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction) 8 While the debilitating consequences of water scarcity are commonly associated with water-scarce regions in developing countries, highly concerning water challenges have already arrived at the doors of the European continent. According to the European Commission,9 11% of the European population (equivalent to 52 million people) are living in water-scarce regions, mostly in countries in southern Europe where water stress periods can last for several months.

NASA views water scarcity as the environmental \u2018challenge of the century\u2019.10 That said, there is a glimmer of hope if the goals of the Paris agreement are met; however, global society continues to struggle to address climate change. \u201cBetween 184 and 270 million fewer people are projected to be exposed to increases in water scarcity in 2050 at about 1.5 degrees Celsius warming than at 2 degrees warming.\u201d 11 Climate change-related scenarios elaborated by the UK-based website Carbon Brief12 depict a similar and no less alarming picture of the impact of different temperature levels on the global water supply and water availability: Download full infographic The costs of inaction Scarce supplies of water also have a significant financial and economic impact. The UN has predicted that: regions suffering from water scarcity could see their growth rates decline by 6% of GDP by 2050.13 from 1998 to 2017 droughts have already impacted 1.5bn people, and cost over USD 124bn14 Corporates across all sectors are also increasingly facing financial risk from lack of investment in addressing water risks. Reports suggest that in 2020 water risks cost corporates USD 301bn, but if they had taken preventative action the cost would have been reduced to USD 55bn. As water scarcity continues to worsen, the cost of inaction is only going to increase. In addition, the costs resulting from the absence of appropriate adaptation measures put further pressure on corporates, as highlighted by an analysis of S&P Global Ratings.15 This report states that, by the year 2050, 24 large U.S. investor-owned utilities would \u201cface a heightened risk of water shortages\u201d, and it further elaborates: \u201cUtility companies can be highly exposed to water scarcity, and the materiality of this exposure is greater for water-intensive assets, like power plants, in the absence of appropriate adaptation measures.\u201d source: https://www.spglobal.com/esg/insights/corporate-physical-assets-increasingly-in-harm-s-way-as-climate-change-intensifies Download full infographic Allianz Global Investors \u2013 Delivering Sustainable Solutions As water scarcity continues to present social and financial challenges around the world, sustainable water solutions are needed even more.

How genomic sequencing scales up health innovation In 2003, the Human Genome Project (HGP) succeeded in sequencing and mapping the genome of homo sapiens. This tipping point in the Genomic revolution not only gave the birth to genomic sequencing as a new and fascinating research area, but also ushered in a new era of precision medicine and personalized treatments. \"[\u2026] it's a transformative textbook of medicine, with insights that will give health care providers immense new powers to treat, prevent and cure disease.\" (Dr. Francis S. Collins, Director, National Human Genome Research Institute, February 12, 2001).1 Since then, genomic sequencing has taken significant steps, enabling scientists to classify and characterize viral samples and thus significantly contributing to the development of vaccines in record time with the help of genome engineering tools, among other things. It is indeed undeniable how important genetic epidemiology research has been in containing the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, gene sequencing has many other important applications such as facilitating the screening for early detection and treatment of diseases. Together with other gene-editing technologies and high-precision DNA synthesis platforms, it helps to modify, delete or correct precise DNA regions and accelerate research and discovery. For example, together with other technologies like artificial intelligence, gene sequencing can have an enormous impact on clinical trials, helping to reduce failure rates and shorten the time to market for many essential drugs. Download full article Deciphering a gene\u2019s superpower \"In 2025, as many as 2 billion people could have their genomes sequenced.\" The archetypical conflict between good and evil is not only played out in cinematic settings, but also in the depth of our DNA. For a long time, geneticists focused on deciphering the code of disease-provoking genes and their variants and/or mutations. However, with the discovery of genes having the opposite, healing effect, the way was paved for the development of medication and treatments that could imitate or simulate the impact of disease-protecting genes. The discovery and \u201cre-modeling\u201d of these \u201csuperpower genes\u201d was particularly accelerated by the possibility to timely sequence the genomes of millions of participants in globally conducted studies. This joining of research capabilities enabled scientists to significantly speed up the uncovering of several protective gene variants and to create disease inhibitors with a similar protective effect like their genetic role models while also preparing the ground for precision and personalized medicine. Personalized Medicine: the blueprint for sustainable health Our genes form the foundation and basis of human health. They are key in determining, for example, if one is at an increased risk of developing certain conditions or of suffering from inherited health problems. The better we understand our unique genetic makeup the more additional valuable information we can gain. This knowledge can help to: develop and prescribe tailor-made medical care perfectly matching not only the genetic makeup but also the actual health status of an individual patient. significantly reduce potential side effects. benefit from better outcomes and a more effective treatment. predict more accurately the individual response of a given treatment. avoid taking additional tissue or blood samples develop tailor-made prevention strategies for specific diseases in accordance with the corresponding genetic disposition adapt the frequency of screenings to prevent or diagnose and treat diseases earlier. change our lifestyle meticulously guide decision-making surrounding our health through all stages of life. In the context of personalized medicine, secondary findings2 - unexpected health results from genomic testing that are not related to the originally intended examination - have proven to offer the opportunity to timely identify genomic variants that potentially or very likely point to severe though treatable diseases. Studies suggest that between 1% and 4% of people taking genomic tests get secondary findings. At the same time a lively discussion has broken out on how clinicians should discuss non-intended results from genomic testing with their patients since they are confronted with a new diagnosis and how potentially life-saving secondary findings should be used if patients refuse to receive them. \"1 in 6 healthy adults is at increased risk for a serious health condition due to their genetics\u2014and probably doesn't know it.\" 3 Despite the controversy on the (future) role of secondary genomic findings, they are a crucial part of the progress that genomics is making in helping us care for our health. ! It is putting the power in our hands to more effectively guide our treatment options \u2013 be it in cancer care, heart disease, pregnancy etc., by finding the precise method of care needed as dictated by our genes. Less cookie-cutter treatments and more tailor-made solutions can make for a more robust and effective healthcare system where the consumer feels empowered, confident, and hopeful. Knowing that physician recommendations were guided by our unique genetic makeup resulting in a personalized health plan paves the way for more sustainable health and can only continue to grow by leaps as we further our research in this area of genomics. Are the costs for genetic sequencing following Moore\u2019s Law? Following recent estimates on the cost trend for genomic sequencing, the rate of cost decline seems to not only follow but also exceed Moore\u2019s law as costs have approximately halved every two years. If this pattern is maintained, the cost per genome will soon fall below USD 1,000. Source: https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Sequencing-Human-Genome-cost, 2021 This decline in costs is contrasted by the considerable growth of the global genomics market, with forecasts predicting the segment to reach a value of USD 54.4 billion, a double-digit CAGR-growth of 19.0% by 2025.4 e = estimated | P = projected. Source: MarketsandMarkets.com The genomic sequencing market is ripe with opportunity for investors. With the rise of more viral diseases globally, the declining costs of genomics which would allow for more personalized treatments as well as significant investment from governments and companies, we will continue to see major growth. With genomic sequencing becoming less costly and more areas for application becoming more available, there will be greater and more sustainable opportunities for specialized companies. Allianz Global Investors identifies genomic sequencing innovators To further accelerate the genomic sequencing research and to widen its application areas, investments are needed.

How should bond market investors respond? Here are two more ideas. Key takeaways Higher-than-expected inflation has surprised markets in the second half of 2021, and it could be more prolonged than many expect. As inflation erodes bonds\u2019 real returns, a long-term investment strategy should seek safeguards. Two possible options are inflation-linked bonds and floating rate notes. 2021 could be remembered as the year that inflation returned. For decades inflation has stayed low globally, but in the last months of 2021, markets have experienced hotter-than-expected inflation and inflation surprises globally are at their highest level in over 20 years (see Exhibit 1). Source: Bloomberg. Is inflation structural or temporary? The coronavirus pandemic with all its consequences \u2013 like the shutdown of manufacturing production in early 2020 \u2013 brought inflation to such low levels that even comparison with the first months of 2021 shows significant variations. This is the \u201cbase effect\u201d, which tends to decrease over the following months as the terms of comparison become more homogeneous. The essential question for financial markets is whether temporary factors or structural forces have been more significant in sparking inflation\u2019s return. Temporary factors are certainly at play. They include the rising price of key raw materials, primarily oil; the strong recovery of economic growth that leads to effects known as output gaps \u2013 where the actual output of the economy may exceed its potential output; and supply disruptions. But our economists believe that financial markets may be underestimating the risk of higher inflation in the medium term. The consensus view considers the current rise in inflation to be a transitory phenomenon: a view the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and other central banks firmly support. In our view, there are good reasons to think that structural forces \u2013 factors that are permanent or sustained \u2013 could lead to stubbornly higher inflation. Changes in the labour market, especially as globalisation reverses, are pushing up the prices of goods and services. And, above all, the expansionary monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, with their adoption of flexible inflation targets, implies they may be \u201cbehind the curve\u201d \u2013 and interest rates could fail to keep pace with inflation. That said, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether the increase in inflation will be structural or more temporary, as the long-term consequences of the pandemic are still not clear. While we clearly do not expect inflation rates to return to the levels seen in the 1970s, we believe that medium-term inflation risks are higher than currently anticipated by the market. We expect inflation premiums to rise slightly and inflation volatility to increase. Two bond market options for inflationary times Should higher inflation prove to be structural, there are two options worth considering when investing in the bond markets. 1. Inflation-linked bonds Inflation-linked bonds (ILBs) are designed to protect investors from inflation as the instruments benefit from rising inflation expectations. Because their principal and interest payments are contractually linked to a recognised inflation measure such as the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) or Europe\u2019s Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), rising prices translate directly into higher coupon rates and principal values. Exhibit 2 illustrates how principals and coupon values change, from issuance to maturity. When to buy ILBs? To assess the relative attractiveness of ILBs (also known as \u201clinkers\u201d) against nominal government bonds, we refer to the so-called break-even inflation rate, which is the difference between nominal yields and real yields. In other words, it indicates the inflation expectations priced into the market, or the rate differential at which holding a nominal bond and an ILB of the same issuer and the same maturity would be equivalent. Therefore, if we expected inflation to be higher over the life of the bond than the break-even rate, we would earn a higher return holding ILBs, while at the same time having lower inflation risk. The opposite would be true if we expected inflation to be lower than the break-even rate. This means that the best market environment for investing in ILBs is when inflation is rising and markets are pricing higher inflation in the future, as they are today. This explicit link to changes in inflation makes ILBs an effective way to incorporate real returns into a portfolio. A prolonged period of declining prices, or deflation, would be a less suitable market context for investing in ILBs because the principle and coupon payments would be based on the deflationary scenario. However, to mitigate this risk, more and more ILBs are issued with a deflation floor. This guarantees that the bond\u2019s principal amount will not fall below par at maturity, so only the coupons are affected by the decline in prices. As with any other bonds, ILBs are affected by interest rate risk, or duration. Interest rate risk could prove topical if real yields move higher following a shift by central banks to a more restrictive monetary policy, as ILBs usually have long durations. To mitigate this, portfolio managers can deploy swaps to isolate and manage the pure inflation risk. 2. Floating rate notes Another area of the bond market that can outperform in inflationary environments is floating rate notes (FRNs), which have their coupons linked to a specified base rate. Floating rate coupons normally adjust around every three months: as the cashflows reset in line with interest rates, the bond price tends to remain stable around par. An everyday example could be a mortgage with monthly payments that adjust in line with a central bank\u2019s official rate. On the other side of the equation, banks and corporations issue bonds with coupons typically tied to a short-term market interest rate such as LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), or the newer interbank indices including SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) in the US and SONIA (Sterling Overnight Indexed Average) in the UK. One potential benefit of linking floating rate bonds to market-determined rates is that they tend to be responsive to inflation risks. By contrast, central bank policy often lags through inertia or a deliberate desire to support growth and employment. Exhibit 3 shows that the market rate often (though not always) moves first and further than the official central bank rate in response to changes in inflation. Investors, therefore, benefit from price stability in floating rate bonds, while gaining additional income if inflation and short-term market rates do rise. Source: Bloomberg. The floating rate coupon\u2019s premium over and above the base rate is known as the discount margin; it reflects the riskiness of the issuer and the bond itself. This margin ranges from a handful of basis points for a highly rated issue backed by prime collateral, to several percent for lower quality corporate bonds. FRNs therefore contain credit risk, in contrast to ILBs which are generally government-issued. Also, to simplify a little, FRN performance can be driven more by market views on short-term inflation, while ILBs reflect the longer-term expectations of break-even rates. As such, the performance of FRNs is linked to the business cycle and investor sentiment. Individual issues may be subject to credit downgrades or even defaults in the worst-case scenario. Conversely, when economic growth and corporate results are strong, discount margins will shrink and FRNs will perform well. Thinking about the different economic scenarios presenting themselves, FRNs tend to perform poorly in times of deflation and contracting growth \u2013 the first quarter of 2020 being a prime example. Strong growth coupled with rising inflation and short-term market rates is the best environment for FRNs, as was the case in 2004-6 or 2017-18. Stagflation \u2013 high inflation coinciding with a slowdown in economic growth \u2013 would present a mixed bag; rising rates would benefit FRNs as coupons adjusted upwards, however only higher rated and defensive issuers would perform well. More cyclical and sub-investment grade companies typically require growth to sustain their debts. It should be noted that FRNs may reduce, but not completely eliminate, interest rate risk, as there can be a lag of a few months before the coupons reset. In the asset/mortgage-backed sector, the bonds are typically secured by specific collateral or assets of the issuer (so that holders of the debt, such as the fund, have a priority claim on those assets in the event of the issuer's default or bankruptcy). The value of collateral may be insufficient to meet the issuer's obligations, and the fund's access to collateral may be limited by bankruptcy or other insolvency laws. Our investment techniques, analyses, and judgments may not produce the outcome we intend. A long-term plan to counter inflation Inflation is one of the most harmful forces that fixed-income investors face, as it erodes bonds\u2019 real returns. Consequently, a long-term investment strategy should consider protection against the risk of inflation. ILBs do not only offer a natural hedge against a rise in inflation, they are also an efficient tool for investors seeking diversification within a broader fixed income portfolio, as they tend to be less correlated to other forms of fixed income. Our expertise at Allianz Global Investors covers not only ILBs, but also a wide range of performance drivers linked to inflation, such as inflation swaps, break-even trades and active management of duration and curve positioning. Likewise, FRNs can benefit portfolios at times of rising inflation and rising short-term rates, even if central banks choose to let the economy \u201crun hot\u201d. Active management is also called for here, however, given the possibility of credit risk. To return to the current macroeconomic environment, higher inflation is back. And while consensus opinion still regards the drivers of inflation as transitory, we think it will be higher than many market-watchers expect. For this reason, it may well be time for investors to seek safeguards. Download the pdf version Investing involves risk.

Find out how increasing application areas of genomic sequencing and declining costs per genome can offer opportunities to participate in the growth prospects of precision medicine and health innovation. Key takeaways: In 2003, the Human Genome Project (HGP) completed and published the full sequence of the entire human genome, a tipping point in the Genomic revolution. Since then, genomic sequencing has gained great significance in the research and development of personalized/precision medicine, as well as other therapeutics and vaccines, contributing decisively to the understanding and mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants and to the development of vaccines in record time. Cost-effective personalized therapies facilitate the identification of patients\u2019 exact needs and the prescription of individualized medicines and treatments. Increasing application areas of genomics offer the opportunity to participate in the growth prospects of precision medicine. According to estimates, the global genomics market could reach USD 54.4 billion by 2025, driven by a double-digit growth rate during the next five years. Load More "

In part two of a two-part paper, we share the results of our proprietary analysis into the asset classes that may provide an optimal inflation hedge. Key takeaways: Given our view that inflation is set to last longer than many market watchers expect, we conducted our own analysis into how different asset classes performed in a range of inflation environments Our research found that with moderate inflation (2%-4%), equities were the top-performing asset class, and sovereign and corporate bonds both generated decent positive annual real returns Perhaps surprisingly to those who consider gold to be the ultimate hedge against inflation, gold\u2019s returns were mixed across different inflationary environments Commodities consistently generated solid positive returns in times of high and rising inflation, but their longer-term outlook may be obscured by the transition away from fossil fuels In our view, global central banks and many investors underestimate the probability that consumer price inflation may turn out higher than expected and last longer than currently priced into financial markets. While we don\u2019t foresee a return to the price environment of the 1970s, we think medium-term inflation risks are nevertheless skewed to the upside, and we may see a more regular overshooting of central banks\u2019 inflation targets over time. This is contrary to the consensus scenario (and the view of most central banks) that the rise in inflation is just a temporary phenomenon \u2013 a perspective that we think is a bit too sanguine. To learn more about the eight factors driving inflation higher, read Inflation: beyond transitory. As a result, we believe investors should take a closer look at how their portfolios are positioned to hedge against inflation. In seeking to determine some of the optimal ways to provide this hedge, we conducted our own in-depth analysis of a range of asset classes. Explore the four sections below to see the results of our findings. Expand All Collapse All Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email 1. How can inflation affect bond and equity prices? From our perspective, the conventional wisdom oversimplifies how inflation affects major asset classes \u2013 as shown in this high-level overview (see Exhibit 1). Exhibit 1: the consensus view may oversimplify the effect of inflation on major asset classes Impact of inflation Asset class Conventional wisdom Our view Why? Government bonds Inflation is a negative for government bonds Usually negative, but not alway Higher inflation isn\u2019t always a drag on performance, in particular if it\u2019s already priced into market-based inflation compensations (\u201cinflation breakeven rates\u201d). Moreover, the real risk-free rate can go down (driving bond prices up) if markets anticipate a slowdown in real GDP growth and, consequently, easier central bank rates. Corporate bonds Inflation is better for corporate bonds, but still detrimental Mixed results Corporate bonds have a complex relationship with inflation (eg, investors make assumptions about inflation\u2019s impact on corporate profits, the pricing of default risks, etc) Equities In times of inflation, equities don\u2019t perform as well as commodities Equity performance depends on the inflation level Inflation can affect equity valuations in multiple ways. Our research has shown that equities have done best in periods of moderate inflation \u2013 historically better even than commodities and gold. Source: Allianz Global Investors. The equity example in particular is worth closer examination, as there are many ways to assess the relationship between inflation and equities. According to the Gordon Growth Model, which is a simplified dividend discount model widely used to value stocks, inflation \u2013 shown below as (i) \u2013 would enter the equation in many complex ways:1 The ultimate effect on equity prices stemming from higher forecasted inflation is unclear, as inflation affects both the numerator and denominator. Obviously, a higher inflation rate can raise the discount rate via a higher inflation premium. But, again, the real risk-free rate is likely to change as well. Moreover, a higher inflation rate can also impact the expected dividend as well as the long-term earnings growth, both in nominal and real terms. For example, dividends and earnings very much depend on corporate pricing power, which itself is related to multiple factors. These include the industry in which a company operates, the difference between economic and accounting depreciation, and the origins of inflation (demand pull or cost push). In addition, the equity risk premium is likely to move \u2013 for example, if the outlook for central bank policy and inflation were to become less clear. However, many investors are not aware of the complex dynamics between bonds, equities and inflation. As a result, they rush to simple and frequently incorrect heuristics when assessing the relationship between equities and inflation surprises. It is therefore of utmost importance to also analyse the empirical data that enable us to identify typical relationships between inflation and asset prices. 2. What are the most attractive inflation hedges? We analysed more than 50 years of performance across asset classes In seeking to determine some of the optimal ways to hedge against inflation, we looked at periods when US inflation was at least 2% and rising, year over year, since this matches what we think is the most likely scenario for the near future. We analysed the year-over-year performance (in US dollars) of several asset classes \u2013 US cash, US government and corporate bonds, US and global equities, and commodities. (Note that we believe our key conclusions would likely hold true for non-US markets as well.) And we sought data going back at least 50 years, when the world entered the current fiat money system post-Bretton Woods. (Where possible, we also looked for data reaching back to 1945 \u2013 the end of the second world war.)2 The top-line findings from our research presented several surprises Based on these parameters, the key findings from our study have been presented in the following table (Exhibit 2). See the Appendix for a closer look at our findings. Exhibit 2: key findings from our research into inflation\u2019s effect on key asset classes Annual inflation level Equities Fixed income3 Commodities and gold 2%-4% Equities were the top-performing asset class (see Exhibit 3). Real returns were in double digits on average (vs long-term average of 7%) Sovereign and corporate bonds generated decent positive annual real returns (around 5% and 7% respectively) Commodities consistently generated solid positive returns in times of high and rising inflation \u2013 particularly true for energy and industrial metals Gold\u2019s returns were mixed However, as we discuss later, the outlook for commodities is being obscured by climate change and the effort to move away from fossil fuels 4%-6% Equities outperformed bonds, but absolute year-over-year returns were in low- to mid-single digits (lower than their long-term average) Bond returns were also in low- to mid-single digits 6%-8% Negative absolute returns on average \u2013 underperforming bonds Bonds outperformed equities Greater than 8% Negative absolute returns on average, though better than Treasuries and corporates Corporates performed worse than sovereigns Source: Allianz Global Investors. Exhibit 3: historically, commodities had been the best hedge against inflation \u2013 but equities also did well in moderately inflationary environments Average annual real asset returns since 1971 in times of positive inflation surprises and inflation above 2% Source: Allianz Global Investors. Other research and empirical evidence appear to back up our findings Importantly, we also found other empirical evidence that backed up our main findings from an economic perspective. Bond returns were likely to suffer in times of higher inflation rates that are perceived not to be only transitory. This is because investors will demand higher inflation compensations, as the historical data show. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that the low current yield of most fixed-income instruments today provides a weak cushion against a rise in inflation and interest rates. For equities, low- to mid-single-digit inflation rates turned out to be a critical hurdle rate for certain economic variables. It turns out that US equity valuations, based on the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, tended to be in a sweet spot at inflation rates between approximately 1.5% and 4% (see Exhibit 4). But once inflation rose further, multiples tended to fall. Exhibit 4: equity prices historically responded best when inflation was around 1.5%-4% CAPE vs inflation since 1971 Robert Shiller, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at September 2021. CAPE = cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings; CPI = Consumer Price Index. What accounts for the fact that a higher amount of inflation had a negative effect on equity valuations? Economic theory suggests that inflation above a certain level creates all kinds of distortions weighing on economic growth: The higher the inflation rate, the more private households and companies find it difficult to differentiate between absolute and relative price increases. Consequently, they may make suboptimal spending and investment decisions, which can dampen economic growth. Private households typically cannot increase their nominal income (ie, wages) in sync with rising expenditures. Consequently, real disposable income suffers from rising inflation, which can also be a drag on growth. While corporate input costs usually increase during periods of rising inflation, companies may struggle to adjust their production processes and output prices accordingly. Empirically, we found that inflation rates between 4% and 6% \u201cmoved the needle\u201d in the wrong direction. Inflation-adjusted corporate earnings growth tended to fall once inflation went beyond these levels. In the same vein, private household per capita consumption and real GDP growth suffered as well. This can help explain our other findings for the various asset classes we studied: Equities have been an imperfect hedge against inflation \u2013 not only in absolute terms, but also relative to bonds, once inflation rose to mid- to high-single-digit levels. In the same vein, corporate bonds have been inferior to sovereign bonds in times of very high inflation (which we define as greater than 8%). This may be because growth concerns take over, and investors start to price in significantly higher risk premia (spreads). The findings on commodities, admittedly, may also be dominated by the oil price shocks of the 1970s. It remains to be seen if energy prices will continue to rise structurally in a world that is moving away from fossil fuels. Gold is not an ideal inflation hedge, in our view. The gold price primarily benefits from low, if not negative real interest rates, which are the opportunity costs of holding any asset paying zero cash flows, like gold. The level of real interest rates, though, depends more on monetary policy and real economic factors \u2013 such as economic growth and the savings/investment balance \u2013 than on the inflation rate. Nevertheless, gold may be supported by growing concerns about the sustainability of the current fiat money regime, in light of ever-rising private and public debt levels and unprecedented global money supply. 3. What are the top implications for investors? Equities: based on our view of inflation, equities are a hedge worth considering While we expect inflation to surprise on the upside relative to current market expectations, we also believe it will remain far below the levels we saw in the 1970s and early 1980s. This would put the inflation rate somewhere between 2% and 4%. At that level, our research shows that equities have historically generated strong inflation-adjusted returns \u2013 better than bonds. In the end, equities are real assets and may be able to provide a solid hedge against unpleasant potential inflation surprises \u2013 notably compared with highly priced bonds. Nevertheless, we should keep in mind that US equity valuations are quite stretched already, which may dampen the return outlook. Moreover, a rise in inflation volatility, not just the inflation rate itself, also matters for equity valuations. Our long-term absolute return expectations for equities are therefore moderate. Fixed income: active managers can still seek positive returns when inflation is rising While rising inflation is one of the biggest risks for investors in nominal government bonds, there are ways for active managers to generate positive returns in such an environment. The four building blocks of nominal government bond yields are the real risk-free rate, the real term premium, the expected inflation rate and the inflation risk premium. Active fixed-income managers can seek to generate returns from positioning on changes in each of these factors using a variety of instruments. To learn more, read \u201cHow inflation can be an opportunity for active fixed-income investors\u201d by Jan Simon King, Fixed Income Product Specialist at Allianz Global Investors. Commodities: strong historical performers during inflationary environments, but climate change could affect the outlook Commodities have historically done even better than equities in most inflationary environments, but the outlook for commodities is less clear to us. Economic policy that addresses climate change could create some headwinds for energy commodities, whereas demand for industrialized metals \u2013 particularly copper, which is a highly efficient heat and energy conductor \u2013 will be reinforced by the \u201cgreen transition\u201d. Private markets: for institutional investors, a strong contender as an inflation hedge Although outside the scope of our research for this paper, institutional investors may also want to consider investing in the debt or equity of privately held companies. Private market assets can help investors hedge against \u2013 and even benefit from \u2013 a sustained return of inflation. This may be because of their long-term buy-and-hold qualities and their ability to pass on cost increases. To learn more about this unique asset class, read \u201cHow private markets can help navigate rising inflation expectations\u201d by Emmanuel Deblanc, Head of Private Markets at Allianz Global Investors. 4. Appendix: Want a closer look at four key findings from our research? First, for periods in which inflation reached between 2% and 4% year \u2013 a level that only moderately exceeds the current Federal Reserve inflation target \u2013 equity returns adjusted for inflation were, on average, in the double digits. As a result, equities outperformed all other asset classes we studied. Moreover, equity returns were substantially higher during these periods than they were over the long term, when they returned close to 7% per year. Still, both, sovereign and corporate bonds, generated decent positive annual real returns in this environment (around 5% and 7% respectively). Second, once inflation picked up to 4% to 6%, equities still outperformed bonds, but the absolute year-over-year returns of equities and bonds were in the low- to mid-single digits. In addition, equity returns were lower than their long-term average. Third, once inflation exceeded 6% per year, equities were no longer a hedge against high and rising inflation. Rather, absolute returns of equities were negative on average. Interestingly, when inflation rates were between 6% and 8% per year, equities even tended to underperform bonds. Bonds only fell in absolute terms when inflation was above 8% \u2013 and in these environments, corporate bonds performed even worse than sovereign bonds. Fourth, commodities consistently generated solid positive returns in times of high and rising inflation \u2013 meaning any periods we studied above 2%. This was particularly true for energy and industrial metals, while gold\u2019s returns were mixed. This will likely come as a surprise to the many investors who consider gold to be the ultimate hedge against inflation. However, the outlook for commodities is being obscured by climate change and the effort to move away from fossil fuels.

The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested. Equities have tended to be volatile, and do not offer a fixed rate of return. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bond prices will normally decline as interest rates rise. The impact may be greater with longer-duration bonds. Credit risk reflects the issuer\u2019s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal\u2014the lower the rating, the higher the risk of default. Investments in commodities may be affected by overall market movements, changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes, and international economic and political developments.

How should bond market investors respond? Here are two more ideas. Key takeaways Higher-than-expected inflation has surprised markets in the second half of 2021, and it could be more prolonged than many expect. As inflation erodes bonds\u2019 real returns, a long-term investment strategy should seek safeguards. Two possible options are inflation-linked bonds and floating rate notes. Load More "

        "content": " Don't downsize your dreams Inflation: beyond transitory by Stefan Hofrichter, CFA , Martin Hochstein, CFA | 04/11/2021 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Inflation has made a forceful comeback recently, and we believe it will last longer than the financial markets and many investors currently anticipate. In part one of a two-part paper, we look at the factors that may cause a more persistent rise in consumer price inflation \u2013 and why it matters to investors. Key takeaways: The recent inflation spike has been amplified by several extraordinary and temporary factors \u2013 including the post-Covid rebound and base effects But there are other reasons why consumer price inflation may turn out to be \u201csticky\u201d \u2013 including continued accommodation from central banks, less globalisation and an aging population We also expect the fight against climate change and economic inequality to contribute to upward inflationary pressure The inflation spike is real \u2013 and it may last for some time After years of subdued price pressure and a brief disinflationary bout early in the Covid-19 pandemic, global inflation has made a forceful comeback. Consumer prices in OECD countries rose by 4.3% from August 2020 to August 2021 \u2013 the fastest pace in 13 years.1 But contrary to the market consensus, we believe that only part of the inflation spike is transitory. To be sure, some of the recent rise in inflation is a byproduct of the sharp post-Covid economic recovery, powered by unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus, lingering pent-up demand and surging commodity prices. The inflation spike has also been amplified by several extraordinary and temporary factors \u2013 including base effects, tax effects and supply-side bottlenecks. Yet in our view, there are cyclical and structural forces at work that could lead to a more persistent rise in goods and service inflation in the years ahead. Importantly, we believe this increase could be notably more than what the financial markets and many investors currently anticipate. We expect inflation to regularly reach and at least temporarily overshoot central banks\u2019 targets over time. That makes it worthwhile to take a deeper look at the factors that are driving inflation higher. Eight factors driving inflation higher Expand All Collapse All Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email 1. Central banks\u2019 reaction function is changing After the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, long-term inflation expectations regularly dropped below central banks\u2019 target levels due to a sluggish reflation process. Their efforts at sparking higher levels of inflation were held back by factors such as the shallow global economic recovery and after-effects from the multi decade rise in globalization. In order to address the risk of a \u201cde-anchoring\u201d of inflation expectations to the downside2 (see Exhibit 1), many central banks made adjustments to their monetary policy approach and related reaction functions \u2013 some clearly signalled and others more implicit. Some of their more reactive strategies have new names, such as the \u201cflexible average inflation targeting\u201d by the Federal Reserve or the \u201csymmetric 2% inflation target\u201d by the European Central Bank. But the shift to these new reactive strategies raises the risk of a monetary policy error, particularly when it gets late in the economic cycle. If central banks are too late in addressing the risks that may de-anchor long-term inflation expectations to the upside, they could be forced into a more aggressive and disruptive tightening of monetary policy. This could upend parts of the global economy and make inflation more volatile. It would likely also affect financial markets. Rising long-term inflation uncertainty means investors would expect to be compensated accordingly, which would lead to higher inflation risk premia. Exhibit 1: inflation expectations are on the rise US inflation expectations/compensations (since 1999) Source: Bloomberg, Philadelphia Fed, Cleveland Fed. Data as at 30 September 2021. 2. Excessive policy stimulus is threatening the independence of central banks During the Covid-19 crisis, central banks around the world stepped up their unconventional stimulus measures, buying sovereign bonds at an unprecedented pace. This massive injection of central bank liquidity led to an unparalleled surge in global money supply (see Exhibit 2) that could fan consumer price inflation over time, in particular against the backdrop of rapidly shrinking output gaps3. Critically, we don\u2019t expect this situation to reverse anytime soon. There has been a steady rise in private and public indebtedness around the world, and ultra-accommodative monetary policy has kept the financial system afloat. But the system has also come to rely on this support, leading to what has been termed \u201cfiscal and financial dominance\u201d \u2013 an environment where central banks essentially do the bidding of their governments4. To be fair, higher coordination between the monetary policy of central banks and the fiscal policy of governments was necessary to contain the immediate economic fallout of the Covid-19 crisis. But maintaining this close link for too long would effectively prevent central banks from being independent. It could also introduce some form of modern monetary theory (MMT) \u2013 which broadly describes an environment where governments would end the era of independent monetary policy by taking back full control over the printing of their fiat currency to fund spending. In either case, the rising risk of MMT and fiscal/financial dominance should be reflected in higher long-term inflation expectations and rising inflation risk premia.

Growth in the volume of international trade has slowed and protectionism is on the rise. Reduced international access to cheap labour is putting upward pressure on wages, and eventually on prices. In addition, severe disruptions in global supply chains since the outbreak of the pandemic have triggered a wave of \u201cre-shoring\u201d activities in the corporate sector5. There have also been supply shortages in the UK as a consequence of Brexit. These examples illustrate how the longer-term trend of re-regionalisation and slowbalisation are structural issues that weigh on global economic growth while pushing consumer price inflation higher.

Data as at December 2019. 4. Favourable demographics are in decline as populations age For 30-plus years, the global workforce has been growing, reinforced by globalisation and access to cheap labour. Together, these forces provided a powerful tailwind that drove output up and inflation down, but this environment is coming to an end. A progressive ageing of the world population (see Exhibit 4), rising dependency ratios (where the working-age population is shrinking as a proportion of the total population) and slower growth in labour supply in the emerging world (particularly in China) may contribute to a return of inflation in the years ahead6. The interplay between these factors is complex, but consider that as the world grows older, there will be an increase in the \u201cconsuming\u201d part of the population relative to the \u201cproductive\u201d part of the population. All else equal, prices for goods and services would rise as demand outstrips supply. Exhibit 4: demographic trends point to fewer workers, which could push up wages Working-age population (1955-2100) Source: United Nations. Data as at 2019. 5. Much-needed efforts to reduce inequality could also be inflationary In the last 40 years, there has been a persistent rise in wealth and income inequality around the world, contributing to a structural slowdown in consumer price inflation7. Fortunately, many governments are now making a concerted effort to reduce inequality. This could bring economic benefits and invite higher inflation \u2013 as seen in these examples: The shift towards \u201cbigger government\u201d in the United States and large parts of the industrialised world may lead to rising fiscal deficits, which could foster an inflationary environment of fiscal dominance. When lower-income households get a boost in discretionary income, they\u2019re more likely to spend it \u2013 and this additional boost in spending can push up goods and services prices. (In contrast, middle- and higher-income households already have more discretionary income and are more likely to save, rather than spend, additional cash.) As a result, economic policies that help \u201credistribute\u201d wealth and income could be inflationary (see Exhibit 5a). The combined effects of changing demographics and efforts to reduce inequality may already be showing up in a rising share of labour compensation (wages plus benefits) relative to GDP (see Exhibit 5b). In addition, we are observing voluntary increases of minimum wages by companies in order to attract staff.

Data as at 2019. Exhibit 5b: labour share is rising US labour compensation share (since 1960) Source: Refinitiv Datastream, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 4 October 2021. 6. Housing-related consumer price inflation hasn\u2019t yet surged \u2013 but it may soon While central banks in general exclude asset prices from their inflation mandate, real estate represents a grey zone. Owners\u2019 occupied housing costs (as part of the \u201crent of shelter\u201d component) affect consumer price inflation in several countries \u2013 including the United States, where rent of shelter accounts for 33% of the overall CPI basket and 42% of the core index (excluding food and energy). Within the next few quarters, the surging housing market (see Exhibit 6) is expected to drive up goods and services price inflation. (Higher home prices usually take around 12 to 18 months to spill over into consumer prices.) In this way, there is at least an indirect link to the spillover of monetary policy into asset markets. Exhibit 6: surging housing prices aren\u2019t yet been reflected in consumer price inflation CPI \u2013 rent of shelter vs model (year-over-year change, 1985 \u2013 2021) Source: Bloomberg, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 30 September 2021. 7. Stronger economic growth means more jobs \u2013 but also higher inflation The continued rapid closure of output gaps (the difference between an economy\u2019s actual and potential output; see Exhibit 7) means the global economy has rebounded well and unemployment should continue to fall. This is where the \u201cPhillips curve\u201d relationship comes into play, which states that along with lower unemployment comes higher prices. While the curve has flattened over the past 20 years, it still shows a link between low unemployment and higher services price inflation. Goods price inflation has behaved differently in recent decades, thanks to international forces helping to keep prices down. But goods prices may soon also begin to rise in a more sustainable way in light of \u201cslowbalisation\u201d, rising protectionism and the re-shoring of production \u2013 all of which are inflationary. Exhibit 7: narrowing output gaps point to higher inflation Output gaps in major developed economies (since 2000) Source: OECD. Data as at May 2021. 8. The fight against climate change could lift medium-term inflation Decarbonising the world economy to limit global warming and address climate change has become the preeminent challenge of our time. The importance of this task is undisputable, and \u201cgreen growth\u201d and similar investments may lead to higher economic output and lower inflation in the long run. Before we reach this point, however, the necessary transformation of the global economy may go hand in hand with less access to \u201ccheap\u201d energy, an increase in environment-related regulations, the obsolescence of \u201ccheap\u201d but dirty production processes and high volumes of stranded assets that are subject to write-downs. All of this means that the energy transition will likely be an inflationary one (see Exhibit 8). Yet it is also important to note that this inflationary pressure is a byproduct of internalising costs (at the product level) that have until recently been borne by other stakeholders. For an example of how policy efforts to achieve long-term climate goals have an impact on inflation, consider two recent developments. The sharp rise in gas prices globally in 2021 to some extent reflect the increased demand for energy from gas-fired power plants, which emit fewer greenhouse gases than coal-powered ones8. In addition, local governments in China recently restricted coal-fired power generation to meet climate targets set by the central government. But this also caused disruptions in many industries, thereby exacerbating global supply-side constraints and adding to inflationary pressures.

Data as at 28 June 2021. Learn more about the implications for investors Taken together, these eight factors make a compelling argument as to why consumer price inflation may turn out to be more sticky than what the market currently anticipates. As a consequence, it may be a good idea to hedge against the risk of a persistent rise in inflation.

OECD is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2 When consumers, corporations and other parties expect inflation to remain steady, their \u201canchored\u201d inflation expectations help central banks maintain price stability. If inflation expectations are de-anchored to the downside, the markets think inflation will be lower than the central banks\u2019 target level. 3 In the US, the multi-year growth in broad money supply now exceeds the multi-year growth in real GDP by a wide margin. Historically, this measure of excess liquidity has also coincided with a rise in consumer-price inflation. 4 They do this by pegging interest rates at artificially low levels to reduce the costs of servicing sovereign and private debt. 5 This also has the added political aim of helping countries ensure the domestic supply of critical products, which increases their strategic self-sufficiency. 6 For a deeper discussion of the demographic impact on inflation see, for example, Goodhart, C., Pradhan, M. (2020): \u201cThe Great Demographic Reversal\u201d and Juselius, M. and Tak\u00e1ts, E. (2018): \u201cThe enduring link between demography and inflation\u201d 7 The precise mechanism linking high inequality and low inflation remains unclear, but one driver is that lower-income households tend to consume more. Higher consumer spending tends to push up inflation, all else equal. 8 Other factors pushing up gas prices include supply-side constraints and a generally higher demand for energy.

But given the various inconsistencies in how the phrase is understood, what does \u201cnet zero\u201d really mean \u2013 and how should progress towards this goal be measured? Key takeaways Net zero, where there is no net accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, will require companies to account for emissions generated by all business activities Investors can influence the climate transition pathway by investing in companies that commit to net zero through compelling plans and a proven ability to execute on them Engagement with investee companies is key to understanding sometimes complex decarbonisation strategies, reinforcing transparency, and promoting real progress to net zero Allianz Global Investors is adopting an innovative engagement approach with its investee companies to help tackle the climate emergency Once a piece of jargon used by climate experts, the term \u201cnet zero\u201d has swiftly entered the mainstream in the run-up to the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November 2021. Many countries, regions, companies and investors are announcing climate action goals and targeting net zero by a specific date, usually around the middle of this century \u2013 per the goals set out in the Paris Agreement on climate change. Participation in the Race to Zero \u2013 an initiative of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to rally the largest-ever alliance committed to net-zero carbon emissions \u2013 has grown to 4,800 entities since the campaign\u2019s launch in June 2020. Corporate entities account for around 3,000 of this number. This makes it easier for investors to identify those companies that are working towards this goal. Considering the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, described as a \u201ccode red for humanity\u201d, this acceleration in global mobilisation towards the Paris Agreement objective is an encouraging development. But as investors look to allocate money towards companies contributing to climate transition, it is useful to examine the meaning of the phrase \u201cnet zero\u201d and ask whether all net-zero goals are equal. What is net zero? The term \u201cnet zero\u201d derives from a 2013 IPCC report, which discussed the need to eliminate net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to stop global warming. The \u201cnet\u201d relates to the balance between emissions generated by human activities and those removed either naturally or artificially through carbon-capture technologies. The report paved the way for the Paris Agreement in 2015, with each signatory pledging to meet the targeted equilibrium \u2013 \u201cnet zero\u201d \u2013 by 2050 at the latest. The idea of equilibrium sounds like a simple equation. But for investors who want to support this target through the companies they invest in, the parameters around the underlying calculation are more complex, revealing competing definitions around what is meant by net zero. For instance, a net-zero target is strictly achieved only when the full range of an entity\u2019s activities are included. Yet some companies in some industries (for example, utilities) currently calculate their net-zero activities without including certain geographic regions; in other sectors (such as mining) some companies discount specific assets; while in other sectors (such as telecoms and media) some firms do not include all business structures. However, a best-practice approach should include all business activities across every division of a company, even if timelines may differ between them. Ensuring that Scope 3 emissions are calculated In the world of net-zero reporting, there are three classifications of emissions: Scope 1: direct emissions from sources that a company owns or controls, for example, emissions from a car manufacturer\u2019s own factory. Scope 2: indirect emissions from the generation of energy purchased by the reporting company, for example, emissions relating to the energy used by that car manufacturer. Scope 3: indirect emissions produced outside the company\u2019s direct control through its entire value chain \u2013 these include emissions from before goods enter the company\u2019s gates (\u201cupstream\u201d), for example emissions resulting from the production of steel needed to build the cars, and emissions resulting from handling, distribution and usage of the final product (\u201cdownstream\u201d), for example those resulting from the car\u2019s own fuel consumption. Scope 3 accounts for a substantial share of total emissions in many sectors, but for many firms it is only partially included in calculations for their net zero targets, if at all. We think this is potentially confusing and frustrating for investors who want to know what types of emissions are being included in net-zero targets, and whether there is clear disclosure around those targets. At Allianz Global Investors, we actively encourage companies to develop and implement policies and practices to target a fully scoped net-zero commitment. Our recent analysis of a mining company indicated that, while it had committed to net-zero targets for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, it was also able to quantify and disclose a full inventory of Scope 3 emissions, broken down into 15 categories over its entire value chain. The company has now put in place initiatives to reduce full-scope emissions for those Scope 3 categories over which it has some control, such as shipping. Some sectors currently feel limited pressure to focus on their net-zero activities because they have low Scope 1 and 2 footprints. We expect the focus on monitoring Scope 3 to increase, to ensure equivalence across sectors, and greater alignment with the wider climate effort. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by sector Source: Exhibit 1: GICS sector (based on MSCI World \u2013 MSCI 08/06/2021) Exhibit 2: A carbon dioxide equivalent or CO2 equivalent, abbreviated as CO2e is a metric measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases on the basis of their global-warming potential (GWP) (source Glossary:Carbon dioxide equivalent - Statistics Explained (europa.eu)) Targeting gross emissions to achieve net zero: timing is key In many ways, the journey to net zero is as important as the destination. While the target references a net figure in the future, gross emissions must be reduced along the way. The Paris Agreement makes this clear: global CO2 emissions need to be reduced by 50% (from 2020 levels) by 2030 to limit global warming to a 1.5\u00b0C increase by 2050. This is a global objective, but the Race to Zero\u2019s requirement is that individual companies \u201cshould contribute their fair share to the 50% global reduction\u201d. Another key component of the Paris Agreement is a pledge to keep temperature increases below a 2.0\u00b0C increase over pre-industrial levels \u2013 and, if possible, at 1.5\u00b0C1. Although this seems like a small difference in temperature, the real-world effects could be massive. As such, the shape of the curve showing cumulative carbon emissions over the period leading up to achieving net zero will likely define the final warming level. Understanding this curve is fundamental to understanding scenario analysis for investee companies. The definition and communication of an appropriate interim target aligned to the final target is a minimum requirement for any company joining the UN\u2019s \u201cRace to Zero\u201d2. However, a December 2020 study by Oxford University\u2019s Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) showed that only 50% of large companies with a stated net-zero commitment have made such a plan public. The Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) is one of several organisations that help companies ensure consistency in reporting while standing up to increasingly robust scrutiny from investors. Using a scientific framework, the SBTI breaks down and assesses the targeted global trajectory to create sector-specific pathways to reduce emissions. Its recent decision to raise the bar for target validation \u2013 from \u201cwell below 2\u00b0C\u201d to \u201c1.5\u00b0C\u201d \u2013 underscores the intensified sense of urgency ahead of COP26. 2100 Warming projections Source: Climate Action Tracker Carbon offsets: what role do they play on the journey to net zero? \u201cCarbon offsets\u201d is a catch-all description for all the tools that companies or institutions can use to reduce GHG contributions in one area to compensate for emissions made elsewhere. They are a divisive factor in the net-zero equation. While there is strong consensus about the critical role offsets can play in corporate net-zero strategies, there is still debate around how much they actually contribute. We identify two conditions that should be attached to their use: Carbon offsets should not compromise gross emission reduction actions. Activities underpinning the claimed offsets should effectively, sustainably and verifiably reduce carbon emissions without undermining other sustainability aspects (such as biodiversity and social priorities). Carbon offsets add an additional layer of complexity as we engage with companies to assess their progress towards net zero. We need to consider each company\u2019s offsetting activities in their entirety, in the context of the relevant offsetting strategies that are available. Businesses can choose to compensate gross emissions through indirect investment into carbon credits, or through direct investment into lowering emissions or reducing activities \u2013 both within and outside their value chain. Options for the latter include carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). On a broader level, our view of companies\u2019 climate reporting suggests the use of carbon offsets is not yet meaningful at an aggregated level. However, they are being used increasingly in some sectors, such as financials. They are also the only solution against residual emissions that cannot be eliminated, which are estimated to account for around 20% of current emissions. A distinct engagement approach for climate issues At Allianz Global Investors, we have a long-standing commitment to the stewardship of the companies in which we invest. Engagements on environmental topics, including climate change, accounted for one-fifth of our engagement activities in 2020 and continue to increase. One of our priorities is to ensure that the data companies report aligns with \u201creal\u201d net-zero progression. In other words, we want to see that their efforts are contributing to a genuine decarbonisation of portfolios. Building on our own net-zero goals3 \u2013 and those of our parent company, Allianz4 \u2013 we have enhanced our climate-related engagement strategy. Some key factors underpinning our process include: We use existing and evolving data sets to assess individual firms\u2019 climate strategies, policies, initiatives and performance relative to peers. This helps us refine our engagement approach relating to specific elements of each company\u2019s transition pathway. We seek a robust understanding of how they calculate their targets and examine which of their business practices are covered. We look for firms to align with best practices within their peer groups, for example in those sectors where non-CO2 greenhouse gases are a more pressing factor (eg, methane for utilities). In these instances we will engage specifically on these details. We also consider factors beyond environmental issues to ensure social and governance related aspects are appropriately integrated into companies\u2019 climate strategies. We have a particular focus on \u201cjust transition\u201d as we seek to ensure that environmental goals do not have detrimental social impacts. This can involve understanding the impact of an ambitious climate transition strategy on the workforce, local communities and other stakeholders. We introduce binding goals, which are reviewed and tracked over a period of several years. Our approach to \u201cco-investing\u201d in climate transition favours engagement over exclusion or divestment. Consistency is key As the flagship goal of the Paris Agreement, net zero is a powerful concept \u2013 but the reality of achieving it is complex. A robust framework to measure and scope out investee companies\u2019 climate factors, supported by a rigorous, ongoing engagement process, is critical in directing capital towards achieving shared climate goals. We hope the unprecedented surge in pledges to achieve net zero will continue. They should be complemented by greater consistency and agreement on how we collectively define net zero, which should in turn help further drive mobilisation on a global scale.

At its height, the unprecedented aridity extended across more than two-thirds of the continental area of the United States, with its most severe manifestations in the Southwest, but also extending to Oregon, Washington and North Dakota. US record \u2018megadrought\u2019, a menace to food security This historic drought is the consequence not only of a major heatwave, but also of less rain and snowfall in the winter and spring. In addition to dangerous and devastating fires, this longstanding dry spell produced disruptive effects on the US food supply, as California \u2013 the primary producer of fruits, nuts and vegetables in the US \u2013 experienced severe drought across 93% of the state. Even though California and other states have started to implement countermeasures, large-scale investment is still required to improve both urban and agricultural water use, in order to ensure adequate water supply and sanitation across the nation. Once again, we see how water scarcity continues to threaten life as we know it, compelling us to take action, and to start doing more with less water supply. This is all the more true given that ongoing climate change is likely to make this type of severe weather even more frequent, rendering the need for action that much more pressing. Cyclical weather patterns vs extreme weather events Droughts are produced by years of dry conditions, and while California and other southwestern states are predisposed to cyclical weather patterns, with periods of dry years and periods of wet years, climate change and rising temperatures are turning cyclical shifts into prolonged periods of drought and severe water crises. Persistent Drought Affects More Than Half of US Percentage share of the continental United States\u2019 area under different levels of drought (2018-2021) Source: Statista/US Drought Monitor by USDA/NOAA/University of Nebraska Download full infographic According to scientific analysis,1 similar extreme and prolonged weather phenomena, resulting from climate change and rising temperature, are likely to become the \u201cnew normal\u201d, and will occur with higher frequency, causing even more disastrous consequences. Echoing these estimations, a recent study found that we are on track to experience the worst drought in 1,200 years. As of August 2021, Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the U.S., was filled to only about one-third of its designed capacity \u2013 the lowest water level since it was formed in 1935. Next year, at the latest, this decline will lead to substantial water delivery cutbacks for Arizona, Nevada and Mexico, and will directly affect the water supply to adjacent farmlands.\u00b2 Consequences of drought: fuelling fires and disrupting food supply The megadrought comes with both environmental and social consequences. The drier conditions fuel a more severe fire season. By the end of June 2021, more than 30,000 wildfires had affected over 1.4 million acres, the highest level recorded for this time of year since 2011. In addition to life-threatening fires, the drought has the potential to disrupt agricultural production. California is responsible for two-thirds of U.S. fruit and nut production, and about one-third of vegetable production. Given the water-intensive nature of agriculture, it will be impossible to support the usual production levels. Many farmers have already left large areas of cropland unplanted, especially those farmers producing water-intensive crops such as almonds. In rural areas wells are running dry, jeopardising access to fresh water and sanitation. Today more than one million residents still don\u2019t have access to fresh drinking water in California. All of this points to a huge need for water investment to improve urban and agricultural use of water. The cost side of climate-change-related disasters Extreme weather events and prolonged droughts directly and indirectly impact livelihoods and economic sectors, as both are strongly dependent on water. Droughts and mega heatwaves: put at risk public water supplies negatively impact biodiversity damage infrastructure harm human health reduce energy production. This type of weather also typically results in increased electricity demand, given the need for air conditioning. This can have cascading effects on economic systems. Looking at the economic losses caused by climate-change-related disasters, from 1980 to 2021 the U.S. had to contend with average annual costs of USD 45.4 billion.3 From 2020 to 2021, the National Centers for Environmental Information counted thirty separate USD 1 billion disasters, that cost the lives of nearly 600 people, and triggered expenditures amounting to over USD 128 billion.4 Billion-dollar events to affect the United States from 2020 to 2021 (CPI-Adjusted) Source: NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) U.S. Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters (2021). Download full infographic On a global level, between 1970 and 2019 climate and water hazards accounted for 74% of all reported economic losses.5 Allianz Global Investors: helping to address growing water scarcity risks We look at companies helping society do more with less water supply. While climate-change related drought conditions require significant long-term environmental action, companies producing technologies that help increase the water efficiency of farming can have a big impact. Centre pivot and drip irrigation can result in significant water improvements \u2013 with centre pivot irrigation technology enhancing water efficiency by up to 95%. AllianzGI continues to identify and invest in these innovators that help to increase the efficiency and sustainability of water irrigation systems and to conserve valuable resources, and agricultural players, which can help farmers continue to produce fruits, nuts and vegetables with a much smaller water footprint. Outside of agriculture, improved wastewater management and recycling can also have an impact, with many of companies offering industry- leading solutions to facilitate improvements. We continue to seek out solution providers, helping to direct capital to the most pressing water-related environmental and social challenges.

Against this backdrop, private-markets assets have a range of characteristics that could help investors hedge against \u2013 and even benefit from \u2013 any sustained return to inflation. Key takeaways Assets under the private-markets umbrella have various built-in hedges if the recent rise in inflation becomes a longer-term trend Inflation within the forecast 2%-3% range should be easily absorbed by many private-markets strategies as these levels are already built into pricing assumptions, and could even offer opportunities The structures in which private-markets strategies invest are often less impacted by inflation, and can even flourish in an inflationary environment A sector-specific focus on issuers and organisations with a track record of dealing with previous periods of inflation should serve investors well Download the pdf version The return of inflation has presented investors with a challenge. The search for yield must now be coupled with a need to protect against inflationary trends. Several strategies under the private-markets umbrella look well-positioned to provide that hedge \u2013 and could even flourish if higher inflation persists. Moreover, the geographical spread of private-markets strategies can help investors diversify across economies at different phases in the inflationary cycle and varying responses by central banks. While some private-markets strategies are fixed rate with long duration, they may not necessarily underperform in an inflationary environment if actual inflation does not exceed market expectations for inflation. Private markets are well-equipped for a range of inflationary environments After the financial crisis of 2007-2008, the economy settled into a low-inflation, low-growth environment. But recently, monetary and fiscal stimulus as part of governments\u2019 response to the Covid-19 pandemic has coincided with economies surging back to life. The release of pent-up savings has met with supply-side issues and a labour shortage, putting inflation firmly back onto the agenda. But will this environment last? There are two general views: The market consensus is that this inflation surge is transitory, and there is a fairly low risk of lasting inflation. In this view, the underlying causes of the latest inflation rebound should subside as the world\u2019s economies \u201creboot\u201d, people return to work and supply chain issues are resolved. The contrarian view is that the risk of medium-term inflation is underestimated by the markets. Inflation may surprise on the high side for longer, even if the actual year-over-year inflation numbers peak this year. Certain structural forces could keep inflation higher \u2013 including significant shifts in the monetary policy of major central banks, a changing labour force and ongoing deglobalisation. Regardless of which view prevails, strategies across the private-markets universe may be well-equipped to deal with any fluctuations, and a general reflationary trend could provide opportunities for these asset classes. This paper takes a closer look at how various private markets can benefit from a range of inflationary environments. An inflationary environment is generally good for credit and equity in the early stages, but if rate increases persist, default rates could rise as well. Infrastructure-like industries \u2013 which can frequently be accessed in the private markets \u2013 can often feature lower default risk. Moreover, one of the clear strengths of private debt is that usually it has preferential treatment in a default, and higher recovery rates, than public debt. It is worth noting, however, that we do not expect a big jump in defaults as many higher-risk businesses have used the historically low interest rates to \u201cterm out\u201d their debt. A closer look at how private- markets strategies can turn inflation into opportunity The private-markets universe is vast, and each component has its own unique qualities that respond differently to inflation. Here\u2019s a closer look at several key areas: Expand All Collapse All Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Private equity: underlying companies will be key Inflation within the projected 2%-3% range (which is still low in a historic context) should have little impact on private equity (PE) strategies. Any increase in inflation would be expected to push financing costs upwards over time and likely lead to a fall in transaction multiples. As long as inflation remains within the forecast range, however, any impact on pricing may not be significant. The threat of a return to inflation has already led to higher volatility in stock valuations. Should the reduction in transaction pricing outlined above come to pass, PE investments made at higher multiples at the outset would be affected by a contraction when exiting the position. Given that PE fund managers can actively manage their portfolio companies \u2013 extracting value through better management, mergers and acquisitions, and geographic and other expansion as well as the timing of exits \u2013 they have tools available to help mitigate any negative impact. The bigger question is whether increased inflation would spark a wider recessionary trend. This could impact the price of transactions as underwriting would become more challenging with the accompanying risk of reduced financing for deals. Also, if portfolio companies end up being held for longer as managers delay exits, this could hamper fund managers\u2019 ability to raise new funds. Both trends could result in a slower pace of private equity deployment. But this should not prove significant if inflation stays within the expected range. Sectors that could be hurt by higher inflation include industrials and manufacturing, which would suffer from higher input prices. But focusing on sector leaders could help minimise the impact of inflation on operational performance. Sectors that could benefit from higher inflation include tech and healthcare. Software companies, for instance, may be able to increase prices more easily. Similarly, sectors like education and emerging-market healthcare should benefit from strong secular tailwinds. Whatever the sector, the business model of the underlying firm is key, and the ultimate hedge is to focus on well-run organisations, whose managers have a demonstrable track record of successfully navigating previous periods of inflation and recession. European private credit: variable-rate structure offers a hedge Within private credit \u2013 ie, non-bank corporate lending, which is not accessible through public markets \u2013 any return to a more inflationary environment could represent an opportunity for asset managers who have picked strong companies without overstretched capital structures. A private corporate debt investment also offers several hedges when compared with publicly traded corporate debt. It is typically structured around floating-rate notes, which means the interest rate is variable. As such, it offers protection against an environment of rising rates and inflation. Also, the duration of each investment is typically shorter than equivalents on the public markets, so managers can be more proactive in responding to inflation. And finally, absolute levels of return are typically higher, providing a further cushion. At the micro level, interest expenses are typically hedged by the company/borrower at the outset of the deal, so any interest costs should remain manageable. A spike in wages and commodity prices could put some pressure on earnings in the short term, particularly for those companies that are already financially stretched. If inflation persists, companies with a strong market position should be able to pass rising costs to their customers. From that perspective, inflation could result in greater differentiation between strongly and weakly positioned companies. Finally, the buy-and-hold nature of private credit assets makes them less volatile in terms of valuation. There would likely be fewer forced sellers in the private debt market than in public markets in the event of, for example, higher interest rates. US private credit: focus on high-yield, shorter duration credit We expect high-yield corporate loans involving US borrowers to behave broadly similarly to publicly traded equivalents in response to inflation. The current bout of inflation has been largely driven by labour shortages and supply bottlenecks. While these issues should ease over the next year, we believe inflation is likely to persist beyond the current recovery period as the continuing availability of private capital will likely push most input and asset prices higher. These inflationary pressures are likely to be more pronounced in the US than in Europe, where they have been offset by greater fiscal stimulus. With investment-grade credit, higher inflation and interest rates will ultimately lower prices for longer duration bonds. High-yield loans meanwhile will benefit from their shorter duration, but there is a risk that highly leveraged companies will face rising input costs that they could struggle to pass onto customers quickly enough. Shorter-duration investments would seem generally more attractive while inflation is high. Where longer-dated cash flows are necessary, sectors that can best control input costs \u2013 or high-margin businesses that are better able to absorb inflationary pressure \u2013 look well placed. Asia private credit: ex-China economies could strengthen China was the first country to reopen following the Covid-19 pandemic and surging costs of imported commodities have pushed up factory-gate inflation to its highest levels since 2008. China has had a deflationary influence on global consumer prices since the 1990s. But low margins \u2013 coupled with these rising costs and increased export demand \u2013 could lift prices just as inflation starts to pick up in the US and other reopening economies that have made progress in their vaccination programmes. This trend is further exacerbated by supply chain bottlenecks in other emerging markets, which we expect to drive inflation in the short term. While the supply chain and trade trends could cause an increase in inflationary pressures in certain sectors, ex-China Asian economies such as India, Vietnam, Bangladesh and the Philippines are expected to benefit as companies transfer supply chains. This should further fuel economic growth in these countries as they develop the ecosystem underpinning the supply chains. As a result, within Asia, sectors at the heart of this evolution should be well-positioned. These include telecommunications, clean energy, logistics and packaging. Businesses based around the trends that are likely to accompany economic growth in these countries \u2013 like urbanisation and adoption of technology \u2013 should also present opportunities within Asia. These include consumer goods, healthcare and pharmaceuticals. Trade finance: short duration will help Easy access to working capital is the lifeblood of free trade. The field of trade finance consists of financial instruments built around loans that provide the working capital to facilitate this trade. There is already a structural shortage of trade finance globally and a faster-growing economy will make the situation worse, while potentially improving the returns available for investors. Since trade-finance instruments typically have very short durations \u2013 around 90-180 days \u2013 the impact of rising rates would likely be minimal. Moreover, as liabilities run off, new deals can be financed at higher rates. This means there should be only a short delay between rates increasing and investors being able to secure higher offered returns. If any inflation is part of a wider global reflationary trend, there will also be a resulting benefit to the fundamentals of the underlying credit risk, which should also increase the supply of trade finance deals available. The short spread duration also reduces volatility compared with longer-dated assets. Infrastructure debt: strong regulation adds a layer of hedging Infrastructure debt involves corporate-debt-based instruments that provide the bulk of funding for most infrastructure projects. These typically incorporate various safeguards that can provide further reassurance in times of inflation. Compared with other types of corporate debt, infrastructure is a relatively low-risk, investment-grade asset with a long duration that affords investors some certainty around meeting long-term liabilities. Furthermore, infrastructure is not exposed to the same market risks as other publicly traded corporate sectors, so it is less volatile. Due to the nature of the projects being funded, the organisations behind the infrastructure deals are typically heavily regulated, which adds another layer of protection. Infrastructure projects often take place under a monopolistic or semi-monopolistic arrangement, and those regulators impose high barriers to entry. Inflation expectations are one of the most important drivers of valuation for assets that have a strong correlation between inflation and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation). This describes a large part of the infrastructure universe, but the impact of inflation varies across infrastructure projects: For example, some projects are index-linked to maintain conservative structures. These should see little impact from inflation. Other deals are fixed rate, which could lead to some stress when the deals need to be refinanced at higher levels. However, this can be mitigated by amortising structures that both cut duration and reduce the amount of refinancing. Some fixed-rate deals finance assets that benefit from inflation, which allows them to de-lever more quickly than expected. In a sustained high-inflation environment, there will be much more divergence between the best performers and the worst. Typically, the best performers should be those assets that have high margins, a relatively fixed cost base with sub-inflationary growth and the ability to achieve increases in tariffs. Digital infrastructure is a good example of this type of asset. Conversely, some infrastructure assets, such as ports, are heavily exposed to the deglobalisation trend. Infrastructure equity: close correlation means higher inflation is an opportunity Although the degree varies, investments into the equity of firms involved in infrastructure projects typically carry a high correlation with inflation. A portfolio can typically be split into the following broad categories, according to how inflation impacts them: Real-return regulation. This determines the real return on capex before overlaying additional compensation linked to inflation movements. Nominal-return regulation. This determines a nominal rate of return on capex. This is not directly linked to inflation, but typically will offer some protection against inflationary environments, for example by passing operational expenditure onto customers Volume-dependent. This involves assets that are typically able to reflect inflation in their tariffs to customers in the short and medium term. Tariff-regulation and long-term contracted. These set long-term revenues at the outset. These are not always adjusted for inflation until the regulation is reviewed or the contract expires. Of these categories, real-return regulation assets generally provide the best hedge against rising inflation. In fact, the positive correlation means that rising inflation represents an opportunity to increase returns on investments. For tariff-regulation and long-term contracted assets, the correlation is significantly lower, but still positive. For debt generally, the underlying assets are typically fixed term, and often long term, so cashflows can offer a levered play on inflation. Beyond inflation: look to private markets for yield and return potential The long-term, buy-and-hold nature of many private-markets investments, and their ability to absorb or pass on increases in costs mean that, to an extent, these strategies can provide investors protection against inflation \u2013 both from a mark-to-market and fundamental perspective. But private-markets strategies can offer more than that. They may hold opportunities for investors to find yield and access returns, whether through identifying the sectors and companies that are positioned to flourish during an inflationary environment, or through a structure that delivers a close correlation with inflation. For many, a return to inflation will not be feared. In the context of these strategies, it could even be welcomed. Download the PDF version Investing involves risk.

        "content": " Don't downsize your dreams How inflation can be an opportunity for active fixed-income investors by Jan Simon King | 11/08/2021 Summary Rising prices for goods and services are one of the biggest risks for investors in conventional government bonds. But there are ways for active managers to generate positive returns from rising \u2013 and falling \u2013 inflation. Key takeaways Fixed-income returns depend on what macro scenario is thought most likely over the investment horizon and how far that is reflected in market prices today The four key risk premia for nominal government bonds are the real risk-free rate of return, the real term premium, the expected inflation rate and the inflation risk premium Changes in expectations of how these four factors will evolve determine the direction of travel for nominal government bond yields An active fixed-income manager seeks to generate returns from each of these components separately using a combination of instruments \u2013 a skill that is critical amid an uncertain inflation outlook Inflation is one of the main risks that investors in fixed income want to be paid to accept. All else being equal, as the prices of goods and services rise, the same fixed coupon payment buys less of them than it did previously. Rising inflation therefore erodes the real value of fixed nominal cash flows, while rising inflation expectations prompt central banks to tighten financial conditions, influencing the level of yields and the shape of yield curves in fixed income markets. All else being equal, passive bond investors\u2019 return expectations deteriorate when inflation rises. For active fixed-income investors, however, inflation \u2013 like any other risk \u2013 can also present opportunities. With the right toolkit and sufficient freedom of manoeuvre, investors can generate positive returns from rising and falling inflation expectations, and from realised inflation that is higher or lower than the market was expecting. The two key questions for investors are, do current risk premia over- or under-compensate for actual inflation risks, and how will inflation expectations change over the period in question? Providing answers requires us to analyse the four risk premia that combine to produce the yield \u2013 not to be confused with the return over a given investment horizon \u2013 on a nominal government bond. These are: The real risk-free rate: the nominal yield adjusted for the current rate of inflation. The real term premium: the extra yield investors demand on longer-dated bonds to compensate them for unexpected changes in economic growth or monetary policy. This is not directly observable but can be modelled. The expected inflation rate among market participants. The inflation risk premium: the level of compensation that current nominal yields offer for unexpected inflation volatility. The real yield of a nominal government bond \u2013 coupon income, expressed as a yield on the bond\u2019s price, after adjusting for inflation \u2013 equals the sum of the real risk-free rate and the real term premium. The sum of the expected inflation rate and the inflation risk premium is usually known as the \u201cbreak-even inflation rate\u201d. This expresses current market expectations of the average inflation rate over the period in question. Changing expectations of how these four risk premia will evolve determine the direction of travel for nominal government bond yields. And together these four components \u2013 expressed as the real yield plus the break-even inflation rate \u2013 combine to form the nominal yield on a government bond. Having identified the current levels of these four risk premia and decided how we think they will change over a given period, we can turn this view into active positions, whether absolute or relative to a benchmark. Each of these risk premia can be traded separately, using individual instruments or combinations of them. An active fixed-income manager can therefore generate returns by taking positions either on nominal government bond yields, or on one or several of their risk premia. Managers can position for falling real government bond yields directly by buying inflation-linked bonds and can use derivatives to position for rising real yields. They can take positions on real term premia via curve trades, in which over- and underweight, or long and short, trades are placed on bonds with different maturities. Positions on the break-even inflation rate can either be relative \u2013 by replacing nominal with inflation-linked bonds or vice versa \u2013 or outright via inflation swaps. Finally, options on inflation (inflation caps and floors) can be used to hedge out the risk of an unexpected jump (or fall) in inflation. The option price is a measure for the inflation risk premium. Looking at US long-term bond markets since the beginning of 2020, the graphic shows how the various risk premia have shifted repeatedly over that period. This has led to changes in the market\u2019s view of the outlook for inflation that have required active managers to shift their positioning to generate positive returns.

B 07/03/20 \u2013 19/03/20 Real Yield \u2191 Nominal Yield \u2191 B/E inflation \u2193 At the peak of the crisis, investors needed to generate liquidity as quickly as possible, selling the most (and only) liquid parts of their portfolios: government bonds. Real yields rose sharply (much more than nominal yields since TIPS are less liquid and costlier for market makers to hold than nominal government bonds) and breakevens collapsed further. Short nominal government bond futures Short inflation via inflation swaps (paying actual inflation, receiving the fixed leg) In relative terms: overweight nominal vs inflation-linked bonds. C 20/03/20 \u2013 06/08/20 Real Yield \u2193 Nominal Yield \u2192 B/E inflation \u2191 Central banks\u2019 liquidity injections and enormous QE programme announcements calmed markets. Real yields moved back to mid-March levels and then decreased further over the summer towards their low point in early August. Nominal yields decreased only slightly and break-evens rose.

D 07/08/20 \u2013 10/02/21 Real Yield \u2192 Nominal Yield \u2197 B/E inflation \u2197 As long-term growth expectations stabilised, real yields moved sideways during the next half year (the term premium rose as shorter-term real yields shrank further on near-term growth fears due to renewed lockdowns). Inflation expectations continued to increase alongside nominal yields.

A large part of this move was driven by the real term premium whilst break-even inflation rates rose only slightly. Short nominal government bond futures Curve trade: short 10y vs long 5y (to benefit from a rising term premium) Long inflation via inflation swaps (receiving actual inflation, paying the fixed leg) In relative terms: overweight inflation-linked bonds vs nominal bonds F 20/03/21 \u2013 11/06/21 Real Yield \u2198 Nominal Yield \u2198 B/E inflation \u2192 Both nominal and real yields receded again (moving largely in parallel) whereas break-even inflation expectations went back to mid-March levels. Long nominal government bonds Learn how to turn inflation into an opportunity Inflation is a key risk for fixed-income investors, but one that active managers can turn into an opportunity. To do so, they must understand and harness the different risk premia that drive government bond yields.

Key takeaways We find that active volatility management is beneficial for many major asset classes and for mixed asset portfolios, leading to more consistent wealth accumulation over time. In cross-validations, we find that fast-moving volatility forecasts seem beneficial because they have better forecasting accuracy and produce economic gains in terms of risk accuracy and performance. We also find significant reduction of tail risks for most assets, except for bonds, where the reduction is minor.

        "content": " Active is: Thinking without limits Why it pays to stay agile in an age of low interest rates by Franck Dixmier , Ingo R. Mainert | 29/07/2021 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary With low rates to the left of them, inflation concerns to the right, investors may feel stuck in the middle as they seek to protect and enhance their savings. How should they rethink portfolios to keep pace? Key takeaways Rates may continue to rise slightly, but evidence suggests they will remain extremely low against all historical measures A worldwide glut of capital has coincided with a relative shortage of opportunities to invest, pushing rates down further Debt levels are currently at historic highs; these are serviceable at low rates, but tend to suppress future growth Quantitative easing, which was seen as experimental a decade ago, has become the status quo and monetary policy will remain loose Last year, during the most acute phase of the Covid-19 crisis, the world\u2019s major central banks intervened on an unprecedented scale \u2013 cutting interest rates, buying government bonds and providing massive liquidity to the global economy. Sovereign bond yields reacted by sinking to historic lows: -0.9% on the 10-year German Bund and 0.5% on 10-year US Treasuries. With a brisk \u2013 albeit uneven \u2013 economic recovery underway across much of the world, and yields well above their recent low point, some commentators believe global rates have turned a corner. The argument goes that the four-decade bond bull market, which has pushed yields steadily lower, is now over. A resurgence of growth and inflation means that materially higher rates are inevitable. Though it is tempting to think that the recent climb in bond yields heralds a change of regime, we think this view is mistaken. While rates may rise somewhat from here, there is ample evidence that they will remain extremely low against all historical measures. Indeed, multiple factors indicate that interest rates will stay \u201clower for even longer\u201d, based on both long-term economic trends and more recent developments. Rethinking portfolios to account for this outlook should be an urgent priority for investors. Slower growth is suppressing interest rates To take the longer-term factors first, the forces that have propelled a 40-year bull market in government bonds \u2013 and the accompanying decline in developed-world interest rates (see Chart) \u2013 seem far from exhausted. Until they are, it is premature to call a decisive turn. Two key factors have helped to drive rates lower: a decades-long deceleration in economic growth and inflation, and falling long-term inflation expectations. Nominal bond yields track nominal GDP closely. As growth slows, interest rates and bond yields tend to moderate. In this context, a given rate of interest represents an equilibrium that balances demand for capital to invest and the supply of savings available to meet that demand. Slower growth tends to suppress investment demand for investment capital and therefore puts downward pressure on interest rates. Equally, if long-term nominal growth rates rise, increasing demand for capital should push up interest rates. But this is unlikely in the foreseeable future. The major reasons are demographics, the changing nature of modern economies and slower productivity growth \u2013 which combine to suppress demand for capital while increasing supply. Chart: Rates and yields-have dropped for decades chart Fed funds rate and US Treasury yields (1980-2021) Source: Refinitiv Eikon Datastream, Bloomberg, Allianz Global Investors GmbH. Demographics mean the world is \u201cdrowning\u201d in savings Increased longevity across the developed world has tipped the demographic balance, reducing the size of working populations relative to older generations. This has helped to create a worldwide glut of savings that is seeking a home in safe assets, notably bond markets. At the same time, there are fewer opportunities to put these savings to work. This is because of a long-term transition in developed economies from capital-intensive industry and manufacturing towards capital-light, services-oriented businesses, which have lower investment needs. Slowing productivity growth has reinforced this trend by reducing long-term rates of economic expansion, again suppressing demand for investment capital. The result is an abundance of capital and a relative shortage of opportunities to invest it, leading to downward pressure on interest rates. All these factors are long-term in nature and firmly entrenched \u2013 none of them is likely to reverse imminently. Debt is at record levels In addition, the world has accumulated a vast amount of debt \u2013 public and private \u2013 in the years since the global financial crisis, and especially since the Covid-19 crisis began in 2020. Massive debt burdens, although more easily financeable at very low interest rates, tend to suppress future growth by diverting cash flows from productive investment to servicing debt. They also make borrowers more vulnerable to any unexpected increase in interest rates. With debt levels in major developed economies at record levels, central banks face a daunting challenge. Any significant rise in interest rates could render huge swathes of existing debt unsustainable and destabilise governments and financial markets. As a result, financial repression \u2013 where inflation is consistently higher than interest rates \u2013 becomes a necessary tool of monetary policy to ensure borrowers\u2019 debt burdens remain sustainable. But it creates challenges for investors who are hunting for yield to protect their savings. In effect, the centre of gravity in central banking has shifted. Policies such as quantitative easing (QE), which were experimental a decade ago, are now routine. Far from seeking an exit from current policies as soon as possible, central banks are now more likely to stress the dangers of providing too little support to the economy, rather than providing too much. So, it is not surprising that even though a powerful rebound in economic activity is likely, this year and next, all indications are that monetary policy will remain loose. The US Federal Reserve is expected to taper its bond purchase programme very gradually, with no rate increase likely before 2023. In the euro area, monetary policy will remain extremely loose. Taken together, these factors strongly suggest that the most likely outlook in developed economies is for many more years of historically low interest rates that will keep returns from safe assets close to zero. Implications for portfolios How should investors react? It has rarely been harder to generate reliable income. Equally, preserving the purchasing power of money in an age of financial repression is a constant headache. And if investors venture beyond traditional assets in search of extra yield, how should they diversify and manage their risks? Think of allocations as a barbell \u2013 In addressing these challenges, investors should view their choices as a \u201cbarbell\u201d that spans two groups of assets: those suited to preserving capital (including sovereign bonds, credit and cash alternatives) and those designed to generate capital growth and income (including emerging-markets bonds, equities and private-markets assets such as infrastructure equity and debt and private credit). They can then choose from a range of multi-asset solutions that combine elements from each group to target a range of outcomes. Staying agile is key \u2013 The past few years have illustrated a key feature of today\u2019s investment markets: how rapidly conditions can shift. In an environment where scenarios can change quickly, the optimum mix of assets will naturally need to shift in response. This calls for a highly dynamic approach to positioning that rapidly switches asset allocations within the portfolio as the economic conditions evolve to preserve the benefits of diversification and ensure agile risk management. Consider permanent portfolio changes \u2013 Some changes in portfolios could be more permanent. In particular, this points to a future in which the balance of traditional equity/fixed income portfolios will shift decisively towards equities: a conventional balanced portfolio of 70% bonds and 30% equities may move towards a 50:50 position, for example. A more aggressive 60:40 portfolio might shift to 80% equity and 20% fixed income, or even 100% equities with an equity-risk hedge overlaid. It also suggests that allocations to private-market assets intended to generate capital growth and additional yield will increase substantially. They may reach 20% in a typical institutional multi-asset portfolio. The forces that have driven interest rates steadily towards zero over the past four decades are still at work and will remain dominant for the foreseeable future. Against this background, the way investors approach asset allocation must change, and their approach to risk management and diversification must become far more agile to navigate an era when market conditions can be changeable.

Key takeaways We find that active volatility management is beneficial for many major asset classes and for mixed asset portfolios, leading to more consistent wealth accumulation over time. In cross-validations, we find that fast-moving volatility forecasts seem beneficial because they have better forecasting accuracy and produce economic gains in terms of risk accuracy and performance. We also find significant reduction of tail risks for most assets, except for bonds, where the reduction is minor. Load More "

While farmed fish can meet this demand and one day potentially offset the need to catch wild fish from the oceans, salmon farming, still has a number of major sustainability challenges like parasites and organic waste that threaten entire ecosystems. Find out how land-based aquaculture can present an opportunity to meet rising demand, and resolve environmental problems. Summary Rising demand for healthy, high-end protein is fuelling a surge in fish consumption Farmed fish can meet this demand and one day potentially offset the need to catch wild fish from the oceans But salmon farming, in particular, still has a number of major sustainability challenges like parasites and organic waste that threaten entire ecosystems Land-based aquaculture presents an opportunity to meet rising demand, and resolve environmental problems Eating fish often feels like we are making a better choice. Typically, fish has less saturated fat than meat, and a wider range of beneficial compounds like omega 3 oils, said to reduce cardiovascular disease. In a restaurant, we might console ourselves that the higher price tag means we are tucking into a dish freshly caught and prepared locally. The more sustainability-minded among us might also consider the fish\u2019s favourable carbon footprint compared to a similar portion of beef, pork or chicken. On the face of it, fish is indeed superior to meat from a sustainability perspective. In the wild, herbivorous fish consume algae, and are in turn eaten by their carnivorous counterparts. The process requires no deforestation for grazing, no otherwise productive land is given over to producing feedstock, and no chemical interventions are required in order to grow or maintain supply. However, harvesting fish at an industrial scale has clear environmental consequences. These range from overfishing, to ecosystem destruction and of course, plastic pollution from fishing equipment. According to Greenpeace, socalled \u2018Ghost Gear\u2019 accounts for 10% of all plastic ocean pollution.1 How fish farming addresses the shortcomings of industrial fisheries Fish farming or \u2018aquaculture\u2019 presents solutions to some of these problems. The most commonly farmed fish are carp and tilapia, both grown in fresh water, inland. Salmon, the most valuable aquaculture species, are farmed in coastal marine waters. As with wild fish, no forests have been lost. And, while grain is fed to farmed fish, the conversion of those grains into proteins is more than 5X more efficient than beef.2 This superior \u2018Feed Conversion Ratio\u2019 means far fewer resources are used in the production of fish vs. beef. Consequently, the advantages are economic as well as environmental. The consumption of fish has accordingly skyrocketed. Partly, this is due to a surging global population, with the world expected to reach 9 billion inhabitants by 2050. However, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the global consumption of fish has increased at twice the rate of population growth since 1961, at 3.1%3 p.a. Absolute demand for protein has thus been reinforced by rising average incomes, with perceptions of health and status meaning that fish consumption has outpaced the growth of all other animal protein foods.4 Aquaculture has stepped in to meet this demand. As the FAO chart below shows, the volume of fish caught by traditional methods has flatlined since the mid-1990s, while fish farms have boomed. Yet despite its advantages compared to both catching wild fish and meat farming, aquaculture is not without its issues. Salmon makes up around 5% of all farmed fish consumed globally, equivalent to 2.4 million tonnes each year.5 By revenue, salmon and related species, account for almost 20% of the entire global fish trade.6 The sheer scale of this particular subsector has therefore made it impossible to ignore. The major challenges that salmon farming faces Farming salmon creates three main problems. Chief among these are parasitic sea lice. These crustaceans are transferred from wild fish onto healthy salmon, feeding on their skin and blood. As with lice in human populations, high density fish farms make for rampant infestations, and in extreme cases mass mortality.7 In trying to solve this however, farms have created a new setback: treating sea lice requires the use of harsh chemicals. Over time, the lice have evolved to build up a resistance, necessitating the use of ever harsher treatments. These chemicals are then combined with antibiotics to treat other diseases, impacting the health of both the farmed salmon and \u2013 as they wash out to sea \u2013 the surrounding ecology. This relationship between density and surroundings is also at the heart of issue number three: effluent. Like cows, sheep or any farmed animal, salmon generate excrement. Without proper disposal, the organic matter can build up to levels which destabilise local ecosystems \u2013 a process known as eutrophication. As nutrient-rich effluent collects, algae build up and decompose, acidifying seawater and ultimately lowering oxygen content. The result is an acidic, low oxygen environment unsuitable for marine life. A tightening regulatory framework These consequences have attracted the attention of national and international regulators: Norway, as one of the earliest countries to develop salmon farming at an industrial scale, introduced a dedicated Aquaculture Act in 2005, specifically designed to promote the sector\u2019s \u201csustainable development\u201d.8 The United Nations has since developed clear regulatory frameworks for the management of environmental issues in aquaculture.9 And, in December 2020, Canada\u2019s Fisheries Minister chose not to renew the licenses of 19 salmon farms, explicitly citing their harmful impact on local species. A combination of adverse environmental impact and ever-tighter regulation is thus helping to create an existential crisis for the industry. On the one hand, surging sea lice infestations are leading to fewer fish successfully making it out of each farm. At the same time, operators face tighter restrictions and increased costs as a result. Even as global demand for salmon surges, supply is being constrained by the industry\u2019s very existence. The result has been a steady rise in global salmon prices since 2004, with particular volatility over the last five years. Norway Salmon Exports Fresh Price (NOK/kg) An innovative solution: land-based salmon farming Land-based salmon farming offers a potential resolution. Adult salmon are cold water, marine fish, typically found in Scottish lochs or Norwegian fjords. As such, salmon farms have historically needed to be in locations as similar as possible to the fishes\u2019 natural habitat, with all the associated fallout. Once caught, the fish must be frozen and transported, often by air so as to prevent spoilage, to their eventual destination for consumption. An innovative technology known as Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) means this is no longer the case. RAS allows salmon to be kept in large indoor tanks, with every element monitored and controlled. This ranges from temperature, to lighting, waste products and even artificial currents. From an environmental perspective, the closed-loop system means effluent can be removed, treated, and disposed of safely, while also eliminating any exposure to seaborne parasites or disease. Lastly, the water itself is purified and reused. While the technology itself isn\u2019t new, it is only the combination of rising prices and industry pressures which have conspired to make it commercially viable. Key enablers for sustainable land-based salmon farming solutions We look for companies that are providing long-term, sustainable solutions to the planet\u2019s ever-growing demand for nutrition. For example, a Norwegian company has indoor farms in two of the world\u2019s largest salmon markets. Sites in Denmark and Florida not only address the industry\u2019s environmental challenges directly, but also bring products closer to the point of consumption. This means products are fresher, while transportation costs and associated emissions are lower. These environmental benefits go hand in hand with financial advantages. The RAS closed loop naturally lowers the incidence of parasites and disease, in turn reducing fish wastage and the need for costly chemical treatments. At the same time, retaining effluent within the RAS creates a smaller environmental footprint, minimising the likelihood of costly remediation at the hands of regulators. Indeed, far from a potential cost, effluent can become a new revenue stream. Properly treated, fish excrement can be used as a fertiliser, producing income and further improving agriculture\u2019s contribution to the environment. Firms focusing on the concerns of environmentally conscious consumers Looking forward, the economics of salmon supply and demand are expected to continue as global populations and average incomes rise. And while the upfront costs and technical challenges of land-based farming may be higher, the daily operational expenses are lower thanks to automation and lower mortality rates from disease. Consequently, demand should be further bolstered by increasingly environmentally conscious consumers. A Florida-based facility currently produces 9,500 tonnes of salmon each year, and plans to deliver 23 times that amount by 2031, equal to 41% of current US annual salmon consumption. An attractive business model thus demonstrates how addressing a sustainability challenge directly can present meaningful commercial opportunities. More broadly, it encapsulates how an industry upon which we are increasingly reliant, is being forced to innovate for its longer-term survival. As investors, we are uniquely placed to help shape these transitions for the benefit of our clients and society as a whole. 1 https://www.greenpeace.de/sites/www.greenpeace.de/files/publications/20190611-greenpeace-report-ghost-fishing-ghost-gear-deutsch.pdf 2 https://web.archive.org/web/20160616072736/http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context=driftlessconference 3 The State of World Fisheries & Aquaculture 2020, UN Food & Agriculture Organisation http://www.fao.org/3/ca9229en/ca9229en.pdf p.3 4 Ibid p.3 5 Ibid p.46 6 Ibid p.100 7 https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/the-problem-of-sea-lice-in-salmon-farms.html 8 http://www.fao.org/fishery/legalframework/nalo_norway/en 9 http://www.fao.org/3/bb124e/bb124e.pdf 1722226 Want to view more?

        "content": " Preparing for the reference rate change 22/06/2021 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary After the Financial Crisis, InterBank Offered Rates (IBORs) have been declared unreliable by Regulators and new Alternative Reference Rates transactions-based have been developed to substitute these indices. Consequently, most of the IBORs will cease to be published from December 2021. As IBORs are used in a broad range of financial products and contracts, market participants need to be prepared and work on a plan to move away from them. Key takeaways Most of InterBank Offered Rates (IBORs) are going be discontinued from December 2021 New Alternative Reference Rates (ARR) have been identified and developed to substitute IBORs Regulators are publishing guidelines to encourage and support the private market participant in the change. What are IBORs? IBORs stands for InterBank Offered Rates and includes indices as Euro OverNight Index Average (EONIA), EURO InterBank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) and London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). These indices have set the benchmark rate for lending on an unsecured basis, underpinning the worldwide trade in financial products \u2013 from bonds and loans to derivatives and mortgage-backed securities. Why are IBORs not reliable anymore? In 2012, some banks have been accused of fraudulent activities and data manipulation during the financial crisis. As consequence, the integrity of IBORs was questioned by Regulators and National authorities who express the need of rates based on actual transactions and not anymore on bank quotes. In 2017 the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that LIBOR rate would have been discontinued at the end of 2021. Other IBORs will cease to be published from that date (i.e. EONIA) whereas others have been reformed (i.e. EURIBOR) and will continue to exist even after. What is going to happen? Several working groups at national and international levels have been established to work on the definition of Alternative Reference Rates (ARR) for the relevant currencies and to develop best practice and roadmap on the transition for market players. Currency IBOR Reference Rate Alternative Reference Rate USD USD LIBOR SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) EUR EURIBOR EURIBOR (reformed) EUR EONIA \u20acSTR (Euro Short Term Rate) CHF CHF LIBOR SARON (Swiss Average Rate Overnight) GBP GBP LIBOR SONIA (Sterling Over Night Index Average) JPY JPY LIBOR & TIBOR (JPY) TONA (Tokyo Overnight Average Rate) HKG HIBOR HIBOR (reformed) / HONIA (Hong Kong Dollar Overnight Index Average) The transition away from IBORs to the ARR is impacting globally market participants and financial institutions. Precisely, Legal renegotiation are required for existing contracts as well as repapering and repricing, fallback provision should be included in all the agreements, operational developments are needed to ensure ability to process ARR instruments and a proper client onboarding and communication should be implemented. How Allianz Global Investors is preparing the transition? Allianz Global Investors started working on the IBOR discontinuation already beginning of 2019 to assess the impact, to identify the risks, to develop mitigation actions and to ensure a smooth transition from IBOR to the new Alternatives Reference Rates (ARR). In addition, Allianz Global Investors is closely tracking developments, consultations, and publications from all global Working Groups, including their best practice guidelines. click here to download the FAQ Investing involves risk.

        "content": " Active is: Investing for real-world change An inflection point for sustainable investing by Matt Christensen | 30/04/2021 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Recent growth in ESG fund assets under management shows that people are convinced of the necessity and value of investing sustainably. This commitment will come with significantly higher expectations on the part of investors. Key takeaways Massive flows into ESG funds show that investors are convinced of the case for sustainable investing \u2013 and want their money to have an impact Rather than distracting attention from sustainability, the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted real-world issues that investors can help to solve The challenge for the asset management industry is to help clients seize the opportunities of the new era of sustainable investing The world is also experiencing a transformational moment \u2013 as evidenced by the meaningful, coordinated action being taken on climate change The past year has been an inflection point for sustainable investing. In previous years, the focus for asset managers was often on proving the performance of sustainable strategies. With the passing of 2020, the massive flows into these strategies speak for themselves: people have been convinced of the necessity and value of investing sustainably. This represents a fundamental shift in mindset. Even as the Covid-19 pandemic roiled the markets and upended ways of working and living, investors allocated more to sustainable investing strategies. This growth is set to continue. In its best-case scenario, PwC predicts that environmental, social and governance (ESG) fund assets under management could account for over 50% of total European mutual fund assets by 2025, representing a compound annual growth rate of 28.8% from 2019 to 2025.1 Indeed, rather than distracting attention from sustainability, the pandemic has highlighted real-world issues that only sustainable investments can help solve. In addition, many sustainable finance products have exhibited resilient performance during this period of volatility \u2013 further underscoring the case for sustainable investing. But increased investor commitment comes with significantly higher expectations. The next challenge for the asset management industry is to help our clients position themselves for the opportunities of the new era of sustainable investing \u2013 and to help clients target the outcomes they seek. This is a challenge embraced by all of us at Allianz Global Investors. The last financial crisis still casts a long shadow on the industry, and we must use this opportunity to build our clients\u2019 trust and show our purpose. That means allocating capital to areas with the most transformative opportunities \u2013 for investors and for society at large. The world is also experiencing a transformational moment \u2013 as evidenced by the meaningful, coordinated action being taken on climate change. The Paris Agreement sets legally binding targets for countries to combat climate change, and US President Joe Biden took an early decision to have the US rejoin this key global initiative. The UN Sustainable Development Goals, now six years old, provide another clear blueprint for government action \u2013 and they also show investors how to have a measurable impact on real-world issues. Moreover, the European Green Deal means the EU will push to become climate-neutral by 2050, and China has pledged to reach \u201cpeak carbon\u201d by 2030 on the way to its goal of carbon-neutrality by 2060. Clearly, meaningful improvements will be achieved over the coming decades. Governments will do their part to encourage the change they want to see. The European Union has committed to making ESG concerns a central part of financial services regulation \u2013 including with the important new mandate for sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector (SFDR). Moreover, the EU Taxonomy to be implemented by the end of 2021 will show investors what funds labelled \u201cenvironmentally sustainable\u201d should entail. These actions set a template for other countries around the world. Furthermore, the pandemic showed that governments are unafraid to take action to address crises. There is no escaping the critical role that governments play \u2013 from setting policy on climate change to sponsoring the research and development required to develop zero-carbon solutions. Many have heard the global rallying cry to \u201cbuild back better\u201d following the pandemic \u2013 and that requires thinking sustainably. While much of the focus has rightly been on climate change, as asset managers we must be ready to help our clients address other areas of growing priority \u2013 including providing better healthcare, improving food security, conquering the digital divide and addressing inequality in all its guises \u2013 that are rising up the agenda for investors. Yet even with so much work to be done, the world is moving in the right direction. Asset managers can continue to do their part by working with partners and clients \u2013 across both the public and private sectors \u2013 to create opportunities, not just identify them. Investors want to see real-world change, and it is incumbent on the industry to help make this happen.

We\u2019re using our expertise and insights to explain why these themes represent some of the biggest opportunities and risks for portfolios \u2013 and what investors can do. Key takeaways Fundamental changes have made the traditional \u201crules\u201d of investing less relevant \u2013 which is why we\u2019re exploring three investable themes to help investors navigate a new era Investable theme #1: If rates and yields stay lower for even longer, investors will need strategies to pursue higher yields and returns while managing risk Investable theme #2: China is the world\u2019s new economic powerhouse, and investors must consider how to incorporate it \u2013 whatever the asset class and wherever they are in the world Investable theme #3: With sustainability now essential to how the world invests, clients need help thinking in new ways \u2013 for example, by focusing on outcome-oriented results where the impact is measurable Guiding our clients through a fundamentally different landscape The world is experiencing a time of profound change that in some respects has only been accelerated by a global pandemic. The traditional \u201crules\u201d of investing \u2013 which were already being challenged \u2013have become increasingly less relevant. For example, sustainable investing was reaching a tipping point prior to the pandemic, and rather than detracting from this focus, the pandemic has caused investors to double down on their commitment. Now, more people are seeking to invest their money with a particular purpose in mind \u2013 whether it\u2019s to address social issues or climate change. Meanwhile, investors are adjusting to the realisation that the current low-interest-rate environment might be a permanent fixture \u2013 from which there is no obvious exit. To address these shifts, we gathered investment professionals and client experts from across Allianz Global Investors for several hours of intense discussion and debate online. Two topics kept recurring. One was the Covid-19 pandemic, which has taken an intense human and economic toll while also upending previous ways of living and working. The other was the accelerating pace of innovation, much of it in high-tech fields such as artificial intelligence. As we delved deeper into what\u2019s driving economies and markets today \u2013 and where they may be headed in the future \u2013 we gradually homed in on three overarching and interconnected themes: a resurgent China, persistently low yields, and the drive to live and invest more sustainably. Far more than simple trends, we believe they individually \u2013 and together \u2013 will have a significant bearing on how and where we invest in the foreseeable future. Because they represent some of the biggest opportunities and risks for client portfolios, we call them \u201cinvestable themes\u201d. So what happens next? Over the coming months, we\u2019ll use our expertise and global research capabilities to generate proprietary insights and commentaries that address some of the most pressing opportunities emerging from these themes. And we will apply the capabilities and insights of Allianz Global Investors to create actionable strategies for our clients. First, here\u2019s more detail on our three themes. An introduction to our three investable themes Lower for even longer? How to achieve income and growth in an age of suppressed yields Monetary policy has always been a key driver of economic growth and financial markets. But the approach of central banks has fundamentally changed in recent years. Stubbornly low interest rates have become the norm, and while long-term rates may rise somewhat in the near future, we are still in the midst of a secular shift to a lower-rate environment. You can see it in the steep fall in 10-year US Treasury yields over the past 40 years. 1981: 16% 10-year US Treasury yield1 2021: 1.6% 10-year US Treasury yield We believe this won\u2019t end anytime soon. As we move deeper into the recovery from Covid-19, central banks have pledged to keep their monetary policy \u201ceasy\u201d for an extended time, with low rates and elevated levels of liquidity in the financial system. Indeed, given the level of government indebtedness and the extent to which markets have become \u201chooked\u201d on cheap money, few decision makers have the appetite to change. So if the environment becomes lower not just longer, but potentially forever, what are the implications? Are central banks simply the servants of governments as a new \u201cstate capitalism\u201d takes hold? Most importantly for investors, how should they reposition their portfolios for the unfolding environment? And how can they push for higher yields and better overall returns while keeping risk in check? We\u2019re using our proprietary research and expert insights to answer these and other pressing questions for clients. Appreciating China: How to invest in the new economic powerhouse China is perhaps the only major economy that bounced back quickly from the Covid-19 pandemic. There are many reasons for this, but one of the biggest is that China had already embarked on a long-term economic transformation that paid dividends after the crisis passed. No longer the low-cost manufacturer to the world, China has implemented a long-term growth strategy that will be powered by innovation in technology, data and science. As China\u2019s economy develops, its capital markets are maturing as well. Their integration into the global financial system is likely to be one of the defining structural shifts in the coming decades. While China A-shares are an increasingly common fixture in portfolios, the growth in China\u2019s bond markets also makes the country an option for investors seeking income. As an investment, China is still an enigma for many, but its markets are nevertheless deep, diverse and dynamic. Now is the time for investors to consider China and its role in portfolios, whatever the asset class and wherever they are investing in the world. USD 19 trillion China\u2019s equity market cap \u2013 almost double the euro area\u2019s2 USD 15.5 trillion China\u2019s bond market value \u2013 second largest in the world3 35x China\u2019s increase in R&D spending in last 30 years4 16% China\u2019s share of global economic output5 Beyond climate: Exploring the frontiers of sustainable investing Over the years, a growing number of investors have sought to put their capital to work in a sustainable way. This has taken many forms, from considering environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors to focusing on \u201cgreen\u201d investments. Today, it is fair to say that the consideration of sustainability \u2013 in whatever form \u2013 is now standard practice for investors and asset managers alike. The growing interest in sustainable investing in recent years has finally translated into significant investments. The priority for the industry is to ensure we meet the high expectations that investors have for those investments. With climate change an urgent topic for many investors, we look beyond conventional thinking on climate to explore the far-reaching implications for biodiversity and other so-called planetary boundaries. And we are prioritising the \u201cS\u201d in ESG as social issues come to the fore. Overall, we seek to explore the frontiers of sustainability for our clients, because we believe sustainability goes beyond individual products or asset classes. It\u2019s core to the way we do business and engage with the companies in which we invest. We stay connected to the way our clients think about sustainability as well \u2013 for example, by helping them focus on outcome-oriented results where the impact is measurable. One way we do this is by using development finance to foster inclusive capitalism, recognising that meaningful progress on sustainability is contingent on economic growth and equality of opportunity. We also use our position of sustainability leadership to help answer the pressing questions we hear from clients every day. How can I decarbonise my whole portfolio? How can I use my capital to achieve a measurable impact? And how can I support the UN SDGs? USD 40.5 trillion in global ESG assets in 20206 +50% ESG share of total European mutual fund AuM by 20257 2050 & 2060 the year the EU and China, respectively, plan to be carbon neutral What\u2019s next? These investable themes aren\u2019t static, and we will continue to explore them over a period of years, not just months. You can expect to hear a lot more from us \u2013 you will be able to read our proprietary research on these themes, have conversations with our experts, and listen to different perspectives from outside our firm. And we\u2019ll answer your questions, examine your challenges and demonstrate how our solutions can help. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll use our investment themes as a roadmap to achieve the outcomes that you seek. Download PDF 1) Source: CNBC.

        "content": " Active is: Expanding the boundaries of investing Asian high-yield bonds look increasingly attractive by Georgios Georgiou , Mark Tay | 18/03/2021 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary In the world of fixed income, Asia can offer more income potential and relative value than many other regions. This should be particularly helpful to investors today, given historically low interest rates and concerns over high valuations. Although some fixed-income securities finished 2020 ahead of Asian high-yield bonds, the region still exhibited positive performance. Plus, this sector features what we believe is a very strong outlook. Among the many reasons why Asian high-yield bonds look enticing in today\u2019s low-yield environment (see chart): The Asian high-yield market has the same average credit rating as its lower-yielding US counterpart. Yet the yield pick-up Asia offers over other regions is at multi-year highs. In fact, since 2005, the cumulative performance and resilience of Asian high-yield bonds (up 229%) has been better than other regions. Asian high-yield bonds have lower average duration than other regional markets \u2013 and lower durations generally involve less interest rate risk. This is particularly attractive today, when corporate bonds seem increasingly vulnerable to losses from sudden volatility in interest rate expectations. Asia\u2019s yield pick-up over other regions is at multi-year highs Yield-to-worst of major high-yield market indices Source: JP Morgan and ICE BofA indices; Allianz Global Investors. Cumulative total return values are based in USD or (for euro and EMEA emerging markets) hedged into USD. Yield-to-worst figures for euro high yield are hedged into USD. Yield-to-worst for corporate bond indices is the yield-to-maturity adjusted down for bonds which can be \u201ccalled away\u201d (redeemed optionally at predetermined times before their maturity date). Past performance is not indicative of future results. See the disclosure at the end of this document for important index information. The strength of Asian high yield bonds comes despite factors that investors might consider negative for this asset class \u2013 including the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and pockets of stress in China\u2019s property market. We expect the markets to further recognise the potential of this sector as investor attention shifts to higher-yielding and shorter-duration assets that offer relative value and greater protection from unexpected macroeconomic shocks. Indeed, foreign investors have steadily increased their holdings, buying about a quarter of all the newly issued Asian high yield bonds in 2020. Given that one of the main reasons Asian high-yield bonds are attractive is their consistently strong coupon returns, which accrue over time, investors interested in this asset class should consider long-term allocations. Moreover, with a size of less than USD 300 billion, Asia\u2019s USD high-yield market is relatively small and concentrated. To expand the opportunity set and add to risk diversification, it\u2019s important to be active in looking for the right opportunities. With more than 70% of developed-market government bonds in negative-yielding territory, and the average investment-grade corporate bond yield at a record low of less than 2%, we may be on the brink of a more strategic asset allocation shift to Asia and China. This shift has already accelerated in equities, and high-yield credit is well-placed to follow suit.

        "content": " Active is: Inventing new opportunities China reaches for the STAR market by Christian McCormick , Shannon Zheng | 19/01/2021 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary China\u2019s nascent STAR market provides a platform for the technology and science firms that increasingly underpin the country\u2019s growth story. Key takeaways China\u2019s new STAR market has been billed as the country\u2019s answer to the Nasdaq \u2013 the technology-focused US exchange Its listing rules make it easier for the country\u2019s tech and science startups to list domestically, thereby supporting the fast-growing sectors that are driving China\u2019s growth Since opening in July 2019 with 25 listings, the STAR market now comprises almost 200 firms \u2013 and nearly 500 are in the IPO pipeline. Once famed as the world\u2019s low-cost manufacturer, China has spent much of the last decade positioning itself to better compete with high-quality foreign peers across the value chain. The government has sought to establish China at the cutting edge of technological advances, especially in the areas of biotech, information technology, healthcare, and robotics \u2013 and as a manufacturer of the components necessary to support those fields. In doing so, it has begun a new chapter in its growth story. To drive further growth in these areas and encourage companies to list onshore, China launched a new exchange on its Shanghai stock market in June 2019. Billed as China\u2019s answer to Nasdaq, the STAR market is specifically designed to house companies in high-tech and strategic emerging sectors, and to facilitate funding to these firms. What the STAR market offers Before the STAR market\u2019s launch, all Chinese A-shares were listed on one of the three boards that made up the Shanghai and Shenzhen-based stock exchanges. The new STAR market aims to streamline the IPO process for innovative growth companies, using a flexible and transparent registration model. The market has no minimum profitability requirement for listing companies, supporting those organisations which may take time to realise a commercial profit, such as those in the biopharmaceutical space. As detailed in Table 1, the STAR market also introduces a new approach to pricing mechanism, investor eligibility and delisting rules, selectively lifting best practices from stock exchanges in the US, Hong Kong and Singapore. The existing A-shares markets that have provided the platform for China\u2019s growth story so far could also follow the STAR market\u2019s lead, and any further liberalisation of China\u2019s capital markets \u2013 driving greater institutional participation \u2013 would likely encourage more Chinese firms to list domestically instead of on US exchanges. Such a trend should reduce the risk premium for all China A-shares over time. TABLE 1: How STAR market addresses the existing Chinese boards\u2019 inefficiencies STAR market Current China A-Shares (Shanghai & Shenzhen Mainboard, SME and Chinext) Listing criteria Companies without profitability track record are allowed Dual share class with different voting rights allowed VIE structure allowed Registration-based, transparent process Minimum total profitability, revenue and assets requirement Dual share class and VIE structures not allowed Approval-based IPO process Pricing mechanism Market-based pricing, no implicit cap Implicit pricing cap around 23 x price to earnings Trading mechanism +/- 20% daily price limit +/- 10% daily price limit Investor eligibility Encourage participation of institutional investors; higher entry barrier for retail investors Only QFII and RQFII allowed All investors can participate Hot IPOs very often have 90% allocated to retail individuals Full access for RQFII and QFII investors; partial access for Stock Connect investors Delisting rules Better defined de-listing rules, stricter implementation Poor implementation of delisting rules The STAR market has quickly become established Investors and companies alike have so far been quick to embrace the STAR market. After launching in July 2019 with 25 names, the market had grown to 215 listed companies by January 2021. There are currently around 500 firms at different stages of the IPO registration pipeline. What\u2019s more, stocks listed on the STAR market are steadily becoming more accessible to non-Chinese investors, offering a new route into the tech startups behind the country\u2019s growth story. The FTSE already has plans in place to include the STAR market in its share indices, although MSCI \u2013 the world\u2019s primary index provider \u2013 has not yet detailed how it will treat the new market. While the STAR market has had a relatively big impact in a short space of time, it has further to go to become an established fixture for investors. There were liquidity concerns in the market\u2019s early days, particularly around larger IPOs soaking up available capital, but by and large the market has functioned smoothly. Even so, stocks listed on the STAR market are not yet eligible for the Stock Connect scheme \u2013 which makes A-shares more easily available to western investors \u2013 so many global institutional investors will not be able to participate. Chinese regulators are set to keep a close eye on the STAR market, given its combination of a lighter regulatory framework and likely increased volatility due to the high-risk early-stage companies that populate the market. Putting a value on these companies will also test the valuation methodologies of brokers and investors alike. But despite these challenges, the STAR market has enjoyed a rapid expansion so far, and the pipeline of potential new admissions bodes well for the future of this market \u2013 and the resulting opportunities for global investors to access some of the most innovative Chinese firms. 1473397 Want to view more?

        "content": " Active is: Investing with conviction Expect US market momentum to continue \u2013 but watch for inflation 13/01/2021 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Investors can start the year with a positive outlook for the markets thanks to three drivers: higher spending from the new Biden administration, wider uptake of vaccines and continued Fed support. Consider layering in exposure to value and cyclical stocks, small cap and international assets \u2013 but keep an eye on rising inflation. Key takeaways We expect economic growth in the US and globally to reaccelerate in 2021 \u2013 a positive sign for many risk assets, but it may push inflation higher over time The Biden administration will prioritise putting money into the hands of consumers and back into the economy \u2013 which will likely support value and cyclical sectors broadly Successful vaccine distribution could release pent-up consumer demand \u2013 particularly in areas (such as travel and leisure) that stand to benefit as the economy reopens US markets have largely shrugged off the political volatility of the new year, continuing the momentum with which they ended 2020. Looking at different market sectors, value stocks continue to largely outperform growth stocks, and small caps are playing catch-up to large caps. At the same time, international and emerging-market equities are outpacing their US counterparts, driven by ongoing US dollar weakness, the prospects for stronger global growth and generally better valuations. The financial markets are also counting on additional fiscal and monetary stimulus in 2021, as indicated by the Biden administration and the US Federal Reserve, even as economic growth has already started to rebound. Against this backdrop, investors can start the new year with a positive outlook for the markets. Investors may want to tactically add to or diversify risk in portfolios, but it will be important to be vigilant as the year progresses \u2013 including watching for higher inflation down the road. Three factors driving renewed momentum in the market shift towards value stocks The Democrats\u2019 \u201cblue sweep\u201d became reality Following the US election results in November, it appeared likely that incoming President Joe Biden would face a \u201cdivided\u201d US Congress and gridlock in the US government, putting most of his agenda in peril. But the resolution of Georgia\u2019s Senate races ultimately ceded control of both the House and Senate to the Democrats, although they still have only slim majorities. That makes a \u201cBiden-lite\u201d agenda likely: for example, tax increases will be less than initially outlined and may not be a year-one priority. Instead, we expect the new administration to first pursue policy items that have more bipartisan support from both Democrats and Republicans, such as stimulus packages and fiscal spending: Covid-19 stimulus in the range of USD 1 trillion could be passed in the first 100 days of a Biden administration \u2013 including USD 2,000 stimulus cheques (meant to put money directly into the hands of consumers) and support for state and local governments. This should be positive for value cyclical sectors tied to the economic recovery. Fiscal spending in areas such as infrastructure is attractive to both Democrats and Republicans. Expect a proposed infrastructure-spending package of under USD 1 trillion. This would include traditional infrastructure as well as areas such as renewable energy and technology (including 5G and broadband). Although clean-energy spending is unlikely to hit the Biden team\u2019s original USD 2 trillion goal, they may still seek meaningful subsidies for wind and solar power and electric vehicles. And Mr Biden is committed to returning the US to the Paris Climate Accord. Other agenda items that could have bipartisan support include cutting drug prices and reining in \u201cBig Tech\u201d. These are important issues for the markets, but they are not necessarily a high priority for the Biden administration. For now, we expect incremental change rather than wholesale shifts in these industries. Vaccines are finally here, despite the slow rollout Stimulus is certainly a helpful bridge for consumers and small businesses, but as long as the pandemic is ongoing, economic activity is likely to remain depressed. Fortunately, vaccine distribution has begun in the US and globally. If it\u2019s effective, the subsequent economic reopening will likely be the biggest market driver in the US and globally in 2021. In such a scenario, we expect pent-up consumer demand to be unleashed \u2013 particularly in sectors such as travel and leisure that would benefit from the reopening economy. This is already reflected in strong economic and earnings forecasts, as Chart 1 shows, although they could move higher in future earnings revisions if more progress is made fighting the pandemic. So far, however, the US rollout of the vaccines has been slower than anticipated. But this may turn around based on a few factors: states will learn how to make distribution more effective; the Biden administration will focus on increasing the number of doses available; and new vaccines from other companies should reduce supply constraints. Barring any severe shocks or setbacks \u2013 including new variants of the virus \u2013 2021 is likely to be a year of reaccelerating economic growth. For investors, this may mean that a bear-market selloff, which often occurs ahead of recessions, appears unlikely in the near term. As a result, market corrections could largely be used as tactical buying opportunities.

The Fed will continue to support markets in 2021 In its final meeting of 2020, the Fed released an updated set of economic projections (see Chart 2). Through 2023, rates are expected to remain near zero and inflation below the US central bank\u2019s 2.0% target. Growth and unemployment expectations were also upgraded, and the Fed is committed to maintaining its monthly asset purchases. This will continue to expand the Fed\u2019s balance sheet and provide liquidity to markets. Overall, central banks in the US and around the world continue to provide strong support for risk assets against what was already expected to be a recovery year.

While keeping this positive outlook in mind, watch for inflationary pressures While the economic and market outlook for 2021 is solid, there are some accompanying risks. One is that rebounding growth and stimulus could push up the prices of goods and services \u2013 driving up inflationary pressures. So far, inflation has been relatively contained, with core PCE \u2013 personal consumption expenditures, the Fed\u2019s preferred indicator \u2013 still below the Fed\u2019s 2.0% target. However, some forward-looking indicators (which measure the market\u2019s inflation expectations) call for higher inflation, as Chart 3 shows.

The 5-year/5-year swap is a measurement of medium-term inflation expectations. Low numbers indicate that the markets are doubtful about a central bank\u2019s ability to push inflation higher. If inflation does accelerate, we see three key risks for investors: The Fed is now targeting an average inflation rate regime \u2013 meaning it will tolerate a period of higher-than-2.0% inflation without raising rates. But a sustained or rapid rise in inflation may cause the Fed to rethink its approach. Historically, bear markets have begun when Fed rate-hike cycles are on the horizon. If higher inflation leads to higher yields, longer-duration assets could suffer. These include certain government and corporate bonds, but also some sectors like technology and healthcare, which tend to be longer duration and could be punished by markets that fear higher inflation. Given that some stock valuations may already be stretched, particularly in certain growth areas, higher inflation and higher yields could push down these valuations over time. Consider tactical shifts towards cyclicals and emerging markets The global economy is recovering \u2013 in part thanks to \u201creflation\u201d policies, such as fiscal stimulus and low rates, designed to boost demand and spending \u2013 and we expect it to enter a true reopening period later this year. As such, we expect markets will continue to favour the reflation theme \u2013 but for how long? Perhaps until the economy either reaches peak reopening growth rates or enters a sustained period of inflation, which makes slowing growth or mounting inflationary pressures key indicators to watch. Given such strong upwards movement already, periods of consolidation or market pullbacks should be expected in the weeks ahead. But investors can largely use these as tactical opportunities to add to or diversify risk. Consider adding incremental exposure by \u201clayering in\u201d cyclical and value stocks, small-cap stocks and non-US assets. Select areas of infrastructure, 5G technology and clean energy may also continue to do well in a post-election world. In fixed income, prepare for somewhat higher rates and steeper yield curves. Long rates (which are generally determined by market forces) may rise alongside growth and inflation expectations, while short rates remain anchored by central banks. More stimulus could also mean a marginally weaker US dollar, which would continue to benefit emerging-market assets, gold and those industrial commodities (including copper) that are tied to the reopening. 1474317 Want to view more?

The agreement of a UK-EU trade deal marks an essential step towards making the UK \u201cinvestable\u201d again but several other factors \u2013 not least the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 will continue to weigh on sentiment. Key takeaways The UK capital markets have been undervalued for some time, and while the agreement of a UK-EU trade deal points to the beginning of the path back, the worsening Covid-19 situation and renewed national lockdown will continue to depress UK markets Given the outlook, we do not expect the pound sterling to strengthen further in the near term following its brief rally on the deal\u2019s announcement The UK seems likely to return to economic growth later in 2021, but the equity market still has structural disadvantages to contend with, not least its sector mix The trade deal with the European Union removes some of the uncertainty facing the UK, even though the agreement is relatively \u201cskeletal\u201d and includes little to address the service sector. It closely resembles what was once considered a \u201chard Brexit\u201d. Moreover, the ongoing Covid-19 crisis and a third national lockdown will continue to depress the UK economy. However, following a year in which the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index fell more than 14% \u2013 its worst performance since the financial crisis \u2013 the agreement with the EU removes one source of uncertainty that has weighed on the UK market since the Brexit referendum in 2016. While the deal is unlikely to transform sentiment towards the UK overnight, investors may begin to see buying opportunities in an equity market that is widely undervalued. Moreover, the prospect of mass vaccination against Covid-19 allows investors to look beyond the pandemic, and we expect the UK economy to return to growth in the second half of 2021: Sectors that were hit hard by the pandemic \u2013 such as hotels, food service, transport, leisure and arts \u2013 will likely see improved annual growth rates after the first quarter of 2021, particularly relative to how they performed in 2020. The logistics sector is expected to expand forcefully, driven by the acceleration of e-commerce as people stayed at home during the pandemic. The construction sector should profit from fiscal measures to boost infrastructure investment as the UK government puts a \u201cgreen recovery\u201d at the heart of its post-Covid vision. Beyond the ongoing pandemic, the UK stockmarket has structural issues to deal with \u2013 specifically the sector mix of its industries. This is a market with fewer technology- and growth-centred firms and more \u201cold economy\u201d and structurally challenged sectors, such as energy and banking. This limits the upside, but even allowing for this, the UK appears very cheap. The other factor to consider is that the UK equity market is different from the UK economy. Many of the largest UK corporations are really multinationals that just happen to be listed in the UK \u2013 they get a large percentage of their sales and profits from overseas. This means they benefit when sterling is weaker because their overseas revenues are worth more. While sterling enjoyed a rally in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit deal\u2019s announcement, we do not expect it to strengthen significantly from here. And, with the worsening Covid-19 situation in the UK, we expect the Bank of England to continue to pursue quantitative easing \u2013 likely by buying UK gilts \u2013 and dip into negative interest rate territory only as a last resort.

Sovereign valuation based on 10-year real interest rate and term premium. Corporate-bond valuation based on implicit default probability and respective sovereign valuation. How Allianz Global Investors is prepared Given the UK\u2019s challenges, we expect higher short-term volatility. It will be critical to be more selective to take advantage of the right opportunities. As an active manager, we will continue to seek to help our clients by taking an active investment approach in UK bonds as well as UK equities. The future shape of the regulatory environment in the UK isn\u2019t yet clear, as the new trade agreement has little to say on financial services. While there will undoubtably be some divergence between the UK and the EU, it\u2019s unlikely there will be a \u201cbonfire of regulations\u201d. 1451528 Want to view more?

Consider layering in exposure to value and cyclical stocks, small cap and international assets \u2013 but keep an eye on rising inflation. Key takeaways We expect economic growth in the US and globally to reaccelerate in 2021 \u2013 a positive sign for many risk assets, but it may push inflation higher over time The Biden administration will prioritise putting money into the hands of consumers and back into the economy \u2013 which will likely support value and cyclical sectors broadly Successful vaccine distribution could release pent-up consumer demand \u2013 particularly in areas (such as travel and leisure) that stand to benefit as the economy reopens Load More "

        "content": " Active is: Expanding the boundaries of investing How a new trading bloc signals a gravitational shift eastward by Stefan Scheurer | 15/12/2020 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary The recently announced Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will likely enhance China\u2019s continued growth story \u2013 and will help boost global GDP. Key takeaways The new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) creates an economic bloc of Asia-Pacific nations, covering a third of the world\u2019s population The deal will apply to almost 30% of global trade and GDP \u2013 more than either the European Union or the US-Mexico-Canada agreement By bolstering China and creating more efficient supply chains within Asia, the RCEP will contribute to boosting global GDP over the coming decade Against a backdrop of ongoing US-China tensions, the RCEP could strengthen Asian member nations Following eight years of negotiations, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was officially signed by 15 Asia-Pacific countries in November 2020. Significantly, it creates a new economic bloc that covers about a third of the world\u2019s population, and almost a third of global GDP and trade. To put this in context, it is bigger than both the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the European Union. The pact will progressively remove both tariff and non-tariff barriers on trade in both goods and services. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, it will lower tariffs on imports by up to 90% within 20 years. On top of this, the RCEP also sets common trade rules within the bloc. The RCEP unites the 10 members of ASEAN (Association of South-East Asian Nations) \u2013 which first proposed the RCEP idea about a decade ago \u2013 along with China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand as free trade agreement (FTA) partners. Chinese growth will have global impact China is likely to benefit strongly from the deal, as it will face fewer barriers to exports into the rest of Asia. But other members within the RCEP may benefit even more. The ASEAN countries, together with South Korea and Japan, will likely find it easier to build their value chains. According to a recent report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Japan and South Korea are also the two countries most likely to benefit in real GDP terms, each enjoying a near 1% boost to GDP. China and ASEAN members meanwhile are forecast to see a smaller 0.3% impact. The report also predicts that by 2030, the RCEP will boost global GDP by USD 186 billion. What does this mean for investors? The RCEP represents an important step towards broader regional integration within Asia, helping to strengthen the regional supply chain over the medium-term and setting the stage for closer economic integration. This translates into several key implications for investors: The RCEP should foster deeper trade integration \u2013 and bring associated economic benefits. As a result, the systems involved in a cross-border production network will likely become more flexible, helping to enhance productivity, accelerate structural shifts and spur growth across the region in the medium term. The closer relationship between trade and investment is expected to deepen financial market integration in the Asia-Pacific region. This should help ensure China\u2019s trade with ASEAN member nations continues to outpace trade with other regions. ASEAN members will likely become further integrated into China\u2019s supply chain. The world\u2019s dependence on Asia \u2013 and mainland China in particular \u2013 for components of all sorts, has only increased; simplified trade will mean both Chinese and US importers may import more from third parties such as ASEAN member states. A unified \u201crules of origin\u201d system under the RCEP should help reduce time and transaction costs as producers need fill out only one document to certify the origin of their products. This could also encourage firms to outsource some production to other countries within the RCEP for cost savings. Perhaps most significantly, the RCEP signals that Asia is moving ahead with trade liberalisation. And from a global perspective, it reinforces the trend of the world\u2019s centre of economic gravity continuing to shift eastward.

        "content": " Active is: Investing with conviction A Biden victory and split Congress may be welcomed by markets 10/11/2020 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary With President-elect Joe Biden facing a split Congress, investors could welcome the resulting \u201cBiden-lite\u201d agenda, which may include portions of his spending plans \u2013 such as fiscal stimulus and infrastructure investment \u2013 but little in the way of tax increases. Key takeaways Markets staged an impressive relief rally during the week of the US presidential election; while the market narrative shifted from a Democratic \u201cblue wave\u201d to a narrower margin of victory for Joe Biden, the overall tone seemed to be risk-on in financial markets Key priorities for the Biden administration will likely include building a new pandemic taskforce, passing fiscal stimulus, funding infrastructure, and enacting climate policy via executive order The Biden administration\u2019s renewed focus on infrastructure spending and initiatives related to climate change and clean energy could create new opportunities for investors, including in the private markets space With a potential \u201cBiden-lite\u201d policy agenda, markets will likely shift their focus to economic fundamentals, particularly around the prospect of an effective vaccine to counter Covid-19 Stronger potential US economic growth, alongside low interest rates and further stimulus, may provide a favourable backdrop for risk markets globally in 2021 Joe Biden\u2019s apparent victory in the US presidential election marks an end to months of political uncertainty and turmoil. While both Mr Biden\u2019s victory and the outcome of the Senate races have yet to legally finalised \u2013 with two Senate races in Georgia set to be determined in January 2021 \u2013 the base case in markets seems to be a Biden presidency and split Congress. This outcome may usher in a more diluted Biden policy agenda. Indeed, the market narrative seemed to shift in the final days before the election: hopes of a Democratic \u201cblue wave\u201d turned into cheer around \u201cBiden lite\u201d, as Treasury yields declined and equity investors rotated from cyclical value stocks towards opportunities in growth and technology. More broadly, the financial markets seemed relieved that this major political event was concluding, leading to a wave of risk-on sentiment in the US and globally. With a more incremental approach to policy changes under a Biden administration, we could see markets perform favourably, as both the US and non-US markets potentially benefit from more stable trade relations and better growth prospects heading into 2021. Markets may be buoyed by a return to a more multilateral approach to foreign policy, and the reduced uncertainty that may result. Perhaps the key concern for markets under a Biden presidency was his proposed USD 4 trillion in tax hikes, including increasing corporate tax rates, capital gains taxes, and personal taxes on wealthy individuals. However, if Congress is divided, most \u2013 if not all \u2013 of these tax policies will be difficult to enact. And importantly, the Biden team may not view these as a year-one priority, as the pandemic and economic relief take centre stage again. Top priorities of a Biden-Harris administration As President-elect Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris consider their key priorities in the weeks ahead \u2013 potentially in the absence of a traditional concession from the sitting president \u2013 these focus areas could include: Creation of a new pandemic taskforce As the coronavirus pandemic remains rampant in the US and globally, one of the Biden team\u2019s first priorities will be to address the virus head-on, with support from a new pandemic taskforce of scientists and medical officials. This will set guidelines to stop outbreaks, double down on testing and contact tracing, and invest heavily in vaccine distribution. This will mark a return to \u201crelying on the science\u201d as a fundamental pillar in managing the pandemic. Fiscal stimulus One area of agreement for both Democrats and Republicans is the need for an additional fiscal stimulus to provide pandemic relief \u2013 albeit in varying amounts. Thus far, Congress has issued nearly USD 3 trillion in stimulus, and Democrats and Republicans have proposed competing packages for a next round of stimulus of USD 2.2 trillion and USD 500 billion respectively. Both packages cover unemployment benefits, small business relief, and another round of stimulus cheques to households. Notably, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has indicated he would like to see a deal done, perhaps even in the lame-duck period before inauguration day. We could certainly see stimulus passed early in the next presidential term, which is likely positive for risk assets. More executive orders on climate and clean energy Mr Biden\u2019s plan includes a USD 2 trillion investment in areas of clean energy, including wind, solar and renewable energy. While this policy would likely face opposition in a split Congress, we may still see a Biden presidency seek to push forward his climate and sustainability agenda via executive order, and he may appoint more \u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d leaders to his cabinet. Overall, we could see new opportunities for sustainable investing under an administration that is pledged to take climate change seriously. Some actions that the new president could take without the support of Congress may include: Rejoining the global Paris climate accord, which aims to keep the global temperature rise this century to under 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels Reversing some of President Trump\u2019s executive orders on energy, including a March 2017 order for federal agencies to dismantle their climate policies Signing executive orders to cut emissions, including instructing agencies to develop methane limits and tightening efficiency standards for buildings and appliances. Infrastructure investment Another area where both Democrats and Republicans may ultimately agree is infrastructure investment. Both Mr Biden and Mr Trump have talked about investing in traditional infrastructure \u2013 such as the rebuilding of roads, bridges and airports \u2013 as well as technology infrastructure like 5G and artificial intelligence. While the Biden team proposed a USD 1.3 trillion infrastructure package, we may ultimately see a smaller package approved by both sides, perhaps in the USD 750 billion range. This would nonetheless represent an important investment in US economic growth and potential jobs. It could also stimulate opportunities in the private markets space to help finance these critical projects. Returning the US to the world stage In addition to rejoining the Paris climate accord, Mr Biden has also talked about restoring US membership in the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as repealing via executive order the travel ban on majority Muslim countries. Overall, a Biden administration would favour the US returning to the world stage as an ally and leader, aligning itself once again with its historical allies and perhaps coordinating globally on climate solutions. In terms of US-China relations, while Mr Biden has pledged to be \u201ctough on China\u201d, he has indicated he prefers a less unilateral approach than his predecessor and plans to bring US allies, labour groups and environmental organisations to the negotiating table. Mr Biden could repeal some tariffs via executive order but may also use these for negotiating leverage. Reaching across the aisle With a focus on reconciliation, a Biden administration may \u201creach across the aisle\u201d for Cabinet and key position appointments. Indeed, there has been speculation that Mr Biden may maintain Mr Trump appointee Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve and consider Republican senator Mitt Romney for the position of US Treasury secretary. Markets may welcome this balanced approach to governing, particularly in key roles impacting financial policy. Markets like evolution, not revolution Overall, the theme of a Biden victory and split Congress seems to be evolution rather than revolution \u2013 perhaps what voters and investors welcome most when it comes to government policy. This outcome also perhaps lessens the probability of unintended consequences that we may have seen from a \u201cblue wave\u201d \u2013 such as rapidly rising interest rates which could be disruptive to markets. Also note that, historically, investors have seen seasonally stronger market returns from election day through year-end. Implications for investors Against this backdrop, we could see a broadening of participation across asset classes, with cyclical parts of the market performing alongside growth technology, and non-US markets playing catch-up, especially given more congenial global relationships and perhaps an ongoing softer US dollar. Notably, China and north Asia could benefit most from a thawing of tension, alongside better virus outcomes in that region overall. In credit markets, with yields expected to remain stable and low, we would continue to see investors \u201chunt for income\u201d. Our preferred credit risk includes parts of select high-yield assets (including \u201cfallen angel\u201d strategies), convertible bonds (which can participate in equity upside as well) and curve- steepener strategies that benefit from better growth and inflation potential. Finally, we see potential areas of opportunity outside of traditional value/growth strategies, including infrastructure, clean energy, US housing, and technology infrastructure like 5G \u2013 all of which could thrive in a post-election environment. With the presidential race seemingly decided, there are several reasons to be optimistic about the broader economic environment as we head into 2021, particularly if we see one or more Covid-19 vaccines approved \u2013 see our earlier piece for full analysis. 1400451 Want to view more?

        "content": " Active is: Investing with conviction US elections: race is far tighter than expected \u2013 again 04/11/2020 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary While the results are not yet final, the 2020 US presidential race is much closer than the polls and betting markets predicted. Investors should expect some flight-to-safety response in areas like US Treasury bonds and the dollar, and technology may perform well if President Trump secures victory again. Key takeaways At this stage, the results of the US elections indicate that President Trump is more competitive in key swing states than markets or polling had indicated While there may still be a path to victory for Democratic candidate Joe Biden, this would come through key swing states that may take days to count votes, like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin Markets may continue to respond favourably to a potential second term for Mr Trump, focusing on his more business-friendly policies and lower tax regime overall; sectors like technology and financials may especially benefit Investors have reasons to be optimistic heading into 2021: once a result is known, the backdrop of rising economic growth, low rates, and stimulus should be good for stocks and other risk assets US voter turnout in the 2020 presidential election may prove historic, with more than 100 million early votes cast. Nonetheless, polls and betting sites may have misjudged the final result. While there may still be a path to victory for Mr Biden, the race has been much tighter than the Democratic \u201cblue wave\u201d that dominated the headlines over the past few weeks. The election will ultimately come down to a handful of swing states that may take days to finalise their vote count, including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Overnight, markets were jolted by the lack of a definitive outcome. Most notably, US 10-year Treasury yields experienced a near 10 basis-point reversal \u2013 reflecting a flight-to-safety response. Meanwhile, it could take even longer to know who won key congressional races, which so far suggest the Democrats and Republicans may be heading for a tied Senate. Generally speaking, markets have performed best under divided government \u2013 when one party has only partial control of the House, Senate and presidency, although in this environment enacting a swift stimulus response would be a key priority. Until the final outcome is known, we expect some flight-to-safety response, which will likely favour perceived safe havens, such as government bonds, the US dollar and gold. Investors may also look towards areas that may benefit under a potential win by President Trump, including technology and financial sectors. We may also see some volatility in Chinese and Asian equities as the outcome is decided. Nonetheless, investors may consider using any risk-off sentiment as a tactical opportunity to diversify or add to risk. Ultimately, a president will be elected, and the policy platforms of the two candidates point to different potential implications for investors: What a Biden victory may mean: A Biden administration may roll back some financial services deregulations over time and reverse some of the 2017 tax cuts, affecting sectors that benefited most from these cuts, including large technology and healthcare firms with overseas operations \u2013 although tax hikes may not be an immediate priority for the new president Mr Biden has promised a higher spend on fiscal stimulus, infrastructure and alternative energy \u2013 sectors such as industrials and manufacturing could benefit from this infrastructure spending He also plans to invest heavily in renewable energy and climate protection, funded in part by the proceeds of any tax rises. His policy agenda calls for a USD 2 trillion investment in solar, wind and other clean-energy sources What a Trump victory may mean: Risk assets have broadly flourished for most of Mr Trump\u2019s first term, and he would continue his commitment to market-friendly policies, seeing the stock markets as a bellwether for the success of his administration Investors can also be reassured that a second term for Mr Trump would likely mean an environment of lower taxes and lower regulation overall, benefiting sectors like technology and financials A key question for the next Trump administration would be where it plans to focus fiscal spending, if at all \u2013 he has left his spending policies open, although, like his Democratic rival, he has highlighted infrastructure as a priority It is difficult to predict what Mr Trump may have in store for a second term, including his approach to US-China relations, now unconstrained by the need ever to seek re-election Looking beyond the election Once we have a definitive result, the path forward will be clearer for investors. There are hopes 2021 could bring one or more viable vaccines and drug therapies to tackle Covid-19. If consumer activity around the globe improves as a result, financial markets could perform well \u2013 particularly against a backdrop of low rates and ongoing fiscal and monetary stimulus measures. We suggest that investors keep a close watch on the flow of macroeconomic data such as jobs, wages and inflation. There have been mixed signals coming out of several regions \u2013 particularly Europe \u2013 as resurgent cases of the coronavirus take their toll on key economies. But if the US and other countries get a handle on this pandemic, it could provide a good backdrop for stocks and other risk assets: In the US, the value-cyclical sectors of industrials, financials and energy have been hit hard this year, while growth sectors like technology and consumer discretionary have soared. This may shift somewhat in the next 12 months, regardless of which party wins the election. Investors may want to consider allocations to select themes. Cyclicals (such as select industrials, energy and financials), emerging technology with long-term growth potential (such as 5G, AI and cybersecurity), infrastructure, US housing and clean energy may all be potential winners in a post-2020 US election era. Globally, we may see US and non-US assets driving market performance. Over time, consider Europe for select areas of value and sustainable investments. In addition, emerging markets, China and North Asia could provide secular growth potential \u2013 supported by a softer US dollar and a return to global growth in 2021. Although be mindful of further escalation of US-China tensions if President Trump wins a second term. In the case of another slowdown, markets would likely anticipate more fiscal and monetary stimulus \u2013 which could be supportive for risk assets as well. Either way, we may see a shift in which sectors are leading, and we expect market participation to broaden in the next 12 months \u2013 meaning different sectors of the market might begin to outperform. 1374796 Want to view more?

Key takeaways Markets staged an impressive relief rally during the week of the US presidential election; while the market narrative shifted from a Democratic \u201cblue wave\u201d to a narrower margin of victory for Joe Biden, the overall tone seemed to be risk-on in financial markets Key priorities for the Biden administration will likely include building a new pandemic taskforce, passing fiscal stimulus, funding infrastructure, and enacting climate policy via executive order The Biden administration\u2019s renewed focus on infrastructure spending and initiatives related to climate change and clean energy could create new opportunities for investors, including in the private markets space With a potential \u201cBiden-lite\u201d policy agenda, markets will likely shift their focus to economic fundamentals, particularly around the prospect of an effective vaccine to counter Covid-19 Stronger potential US economic growth, alongside low interest rates and further stimulus, may provide a favourable backdrop for risk markets globally in 2021 Load More "

        "content": " Active is: Thinking long term, today US dollar\u2019s structural weakness could benefit Asian emerging markets by Christiaan Tuntono | 22/10/2020 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary A bearish longer-term outlook for the US dollar could bolster Asian economies as they continue their tentative recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Key takeaways As Asian emerging markets seek to bounce back from the Covid-19 pandemic, they could receive support from an unexpected area: a structurally weaker US dollar A weaker US dollar would help reduce the foreign exchange debt stock and service burden for those South and South-East Asian economies which have increased USD debt over the past decade A more attractive exchange rate against the US dollar could also help emerging markets attract capital inflows, which have been affected by the drop in global trade While the halo effect of China\u2019s ongoing growth story is a major influence on other Asian economies, US fiscal and monetary policy also has a significant effect on these countries. Given the bearish outlook for US interest rates, Asian emerging markets (EM Asia) could benefit from a weaker US dollar. While the US dollar continues to offer a potential safe haven for investors, and has benefited accordingly, there are concerns about the fiscal health of the US. The US has spent heavily on recovering its economy from the Covid-19 pandemic, with total fiscal stimulus that could end up being 40% higher than similar interventions elsewhere in the world, assuming a fourth stimulus package is eventually passed. This is starting to point towards a more depressed outlook for the US currency \u2013 which could be positive for EM Asia. A weakened US dollar could boost Asia\u2019s emerging markets There are several reasons why ultra-low US interest rates and a structurally weak US dollar are positive for EM Asia: The resulting positive real yield (yield after inflation) offered in EM Asia could prove attractive to international bond inflows. Although Asian central banks have also cut rates to support their domestic economies in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the region is still able to offer positive real yield to investors. Stronger EM Asia currencies relative to the US dollar could help improve Asia\u2019s balance of payment position, attracting capital inflows and reducing the foreign-debt burden. This is particularly beneficial to economies like Indonesia, India and the Philippines, which need foreign inflows to finance their current account deficits (the gap between the value of imports and exports) and which have higher foreign-currency-denominated debt. EM Asia economies generally have increased their US dollar debt over the past decade, particularly in the private sector, so a weaker US dollar would help reduce the foreign currency debt stock, and service burden. A weaker US dollar would reflect the relative outperformance of emerging markets (EMs) compared with developed markets; this outperformance could also be the result of stronger global trade. We anticipate that the weakening of the US dollar is likely to coincide with the world economy gradually stepping out from the impact of Covid-19, and global trade recovering from its current state. The dollar is far from the only factor that will determine EM Asia\u2019s economic success. For example, each economy\u2019s relative success in containing the pandemic will be critical in driving Asian economies\u2019 macro performance. To this end, we maintain our view that North-East Asian economies like China, South Korea and Taiwan \u2013 which are included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and so classed as EMs \u2013 are leading the region. They have managed to get Covid-19 largely under control while their domestic economies have been able to recover and resume normal operation without excessive stimulus support \u2013 either fiscal or monetary. Investment implications EM equities generally tend to outperform those in developed markets during periods of US dollar weakness, and EM Asia is no exception. The DXY (US Dollar Index index tracks the dollar\u2019s value relative to the currencies of the US\u2019s most significant trading partners. Historically it has been negatively correlated with the relative equity performance of EMs versus developed markets. Although this negative correlation has somewhat weakened in recent years, it continues to support our view that the relative strength of EM currencies versus the US dollar reflects both the global business cycle and the growth fundamentals of the EM world. We would also expect EM credit spreads (the difference in yield between EM securities and US bonds) to tighten during periods of US dollar weakness. Historic data suggest that EM credit spreads are inversely correlated with EM currency strengths and commodity prices. As such we maintain our recommendation that investors increase exposure towards good-quality corporate credit in Asia. 1369259 Want to view more?

        "content": " Active is: Thinking long term, today US elections Q&A: investors can find an advantage in volatility by Peter Lefkin | 07/10/2020 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Financial markets could remain volatile as we head towards US elections in November \u2013 particularly with the prospect of a contested result. But this could provide a tactical opportunity for investors to add risk to portfolios, or to further diversify their holdings. Key takeaways The build-up to a US election is typically characterised by market volatility, and this year it has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic; any legal or constitutional challenges to the election result would likely add to market uncertainty President Trump\u2019s Covid-19 diagnosis adds greater uncertainty to an already volatile period \u2013 but volatile markets could provide investors with tactical opportunities If we see a definitive election result and favourable developments in the fight against Covid-19, we expect a broader set of sectors and regions to benefit in 2021 \u2013 beyond the large-cap US tech stocks and growth themes that have done well this year How should investors view the run-up to the US elections, particularly in the context of Covid-19? Mona Mahajan: Historically, the months before US elections have been volatile for the markets, and this year may be no different. The pre-election period comes during a global pandemic that has already caused tremendous swings. In February, the S&P 500 Index reached all-time highs before Covid-19 triggered a 34% drawdown. The S&P then rebounded nearly 60% before a correction in September. We expect some form of this volatility to continue until the election results are known. Market performance will also largely be driven by virus trends, which continue to remain precarious heading into autumn, while President Donald Trump\u2019s Covid-19 diagnosis makes an already volatile period even more uncertain. However, if infection rates improve, an effective vaccine comes online next year and the global economy continues to recover, the market outlook for the US and elsewhere could improve notably. So investors may want to use periods of market volatility in the coming months as a tactical opportunity to add to their positions in stocks and other risk assets. Peter Lefkin: Even in the face of Covid-19, US election polls have been remarkably stable, with former Vice President Joe Biden holding a steady and consistent lead over President Trump. Yet the key to winning is not in the national popular vote, but instead in how the candidates do in about eight swing states. That means Mr Trump has a fighting chance \u2013 although probably not as much as he did at this point in 2016, when he was down in the polls by a smaller margin. The health, economic and social fallout from the pandemic is the most prominent issue of the 2020 election, but it is intertwined with existing long-term tensions in the US that Covid-19 revealed and amplified. For example, some US citizens are faring comparatively well despite Covid-19: they can stay home and work virtually. Other Americans are having a much harder time: they must report to work and risk getting sick, or they can\u2019t work and have lost their income. The coronavirus hasn\u2019t changed many minds in terms of who supports which candidate, but people who did change their views seem to have moved to Mr Biden. In a close election, any movement is critical. Perhaps equally important, the pandemic has hardened existing attitudes, making it less likely that there will be any significant shifts from one candidate to the other before the election. So far, just a few sectors have powered stock markets\u2019 tentative recovery. Will that continue, and what does it mean for investors? Mona Mahajan: We\u2019ve been expecting market participation to broaden \u2013 meaning more segments should do well beyond the \u201cCovid winners\u201d of technology, consumer discretionary and healthcare. A steadily reopening economy, more fiscal stimulus and favourable developments in the fight against Covid-19 would help speed this rotation. In the US, the value cyclical sectors of industrials, financials and energy have been beaten up this year while growth sectors have soared \u2013 but this may shift somewhat in the next six to 12 months. For example, consider that both major presidential candidates are proposing strong infrastructure-spending packages. That seems to be positive for industrials and manufacturing no matter who wins. Broader participation also applies to other regions globally. Europe has attractive opportunities in value cyclicals in the healthcare and financial sectors, as well as parts of the energy sector. And China offers exposure to secular growth stories \u2013 particularly in growth technologies such as artificial intelligence and 5G communications. The US dollar has also weakened this year, which could help non-US assets. Some unloved sectors could be well-positioned as the economy reopens Year-to-date 2020 S&P 500 Index returns by sector Source: Bloomberg and AllianzGI. Data as at 30 September 2020. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Will US interest rates stay low \u2013 and what does that mean for inflation? Mona Mahajan: The Federal Reserve has made it clear that it won\u2019t raise rates for some time \u2013 potentially until the end of 2023. Low rates are keeping investors on the hunt for income, and some are being forced to invest in riskier assets to meet return and yield targets. The Fed has also announced a shift in its inflation-targeting policy, indicating that it will allow inflation to temporarily overshoot its 2% target to balance the nearly 10 years that inflation hasn\u2019t met that goal. This scenario \u2013 low rates, ongoing monetary and fiscal stimulus, and the potential for economic growth to accelerate \u2013 could push up inflation expectations in the coming years. But in the near term, rising economic growth and normalising inflation should provide a good backdrop for stocks and other risk assets. If Mr Biden is elected president, how could that affect the financial services industry and regulations? Peter Lefkin: Mr Biden\u2019s platform is more nuanced than Mr Trump\u2019s, whose policies have generally been good for the financial services industry. Mr Trump helped repeal the Obama administration\u2019s fiduciary-duty regulations, and he has been a strong supporter of private investment plans. Still, only about 50% of people employed in the US private sector have access to private retirement accounts such as a 401(k). Mr Biden has proposed policies to encourage broader participation in the markets \u2013 including implementing tax credits that could increase retirement-savings rates for lower-income earners and younger workers. Mona Mahajan: Mr Biden\u2019s policy proposals call for higher corporate taxes, capital gains taxes and taxes on wealthy individuals. He would also roll back some of the recent financial-sector deregulation measures. Taken together, these policies could hurt corporate earnings, especially for those sectors that benefited the most from tax cuts and deregulation \u2013 financials in particular \u2013 as well as large multinational companies with overseas operations, including technology and healthcare firms. However, tax hikes may not be an immediate priority for Mr Biden while the US is recovering from recession, and he plans to use the proceeds from any tax increases to invest in growth areas such as renewable energy. Mr Trump, meanwhile, wants to maintain the status quo: he would like to preserve his tax cuts and deregulation measures, and perhaps even make his recent payroll tax cuts permanent. Overall, however, the implementation of either candidate\u2019s plans will depend on which party controls the US Congress after the elections. What are the main risks investors should keep an eye on? Mona Mahajan: In the near term, we think the two primary risks are a resurgent coronavirus and the election result being contested in the courts. These factors would likely create uncertainty for markets, compounded by traditionally volatile September and October months. But the election result will eventually be decided, and as of now it appears that 2021 could bring one or more viable vaccines. So if these risks are resolved, and if consumer activity around the globe improves, financial markets could perform well \u2013 particularly against a backdrop of low rates and ongoing fiscal and monetary stimulus measures. Investors may face volatility in the near term, but they could use periods of consolidation \u2013 market pullbacks or sideways movement \u2013 as tactical opportunities to add risk to portfolios, or to further diversify their portfolios. We see the potential for a broader range of sectors and regions to participate in the market\u2019s upside over the next 12-month period. Europe and China are regions to watch, as are industrials and select parts of the financials and energy complex \u2013 particularly clean energy. 1350727 Want to view more?

Key takeaways The EU Green Deal is a blueprint that will push all industry sectors towards more sustainable business models The shift towards sustainability will require significant financial investment, providing opportunities for investors The growing universe of firms enabling the transition towards a more sustainable economy can be grouped around identifiable investment themes A thematic approach, featuring strategies focused on a political, social or environmental growth trend, could help investors better identify potential winners and losers DOWNLOAD THE FULL REPORT The Green Deal is a comprehensive new strategy from the European Commission (EC) that aims to ensure the European Union leads the rest of the world in transitioning towards a green and digital economy. The Green Deal is likely to inform the EU\u2019s actions for decades to come and will open up new investment opportunities \u2013 and it may make sense for investors to consider the opportunities thematically. We have identified four major, interlinked investment themes that we expect to benefit from the Green Deal: Decarbonisation To achieve its ambitious climate targets, the EU will make decarbonisation of its economy a priority, with a focus on industries responsible for the highest share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Green Deal\u2019s stated aims include: Building out of renewable energy sources \u2013 in lockstep with power storage systems and smart and interconnected energy networks Decarbonising the transport sector and the modernisation of heavy industries Promoting sustainable, resource-efficient and high-quality agriculture Encouraging member states to start a \u201crenovation wave\u201d to increase the energy- and resource-efficiency of buildings Circular economy The Green Deal also calls for wider adoption of a \u201ccircular\u201d economic model, which decouples economic growth from resource use and thereby increases energy- and resource-efficiency. The EU envisions products that are designed to be durable, repairable, reusable and recyclable. It also intends to increase its own capabilities around waste collection, processing and recycling. In addition, the Green Deal aims to create an internal market for secondary raw materials. Preserving and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity The EU\u2019s guiding principle for the Green Deal is that \u201call policies should contribute to preserving and restoring Europe\u2019s natural capital.\u201d Direct focus areas include forestry, sustainable agriculture without the use of harmful substances, and a sustainable \u201cBlue Economy\u201d, which unlocks the full potential of aquatic and marine resources while ensuring healthy and resilient seas and oceans. Digitalisation Digital tools will be essential to establishing the Green Deal and driving its impact. Technology enables several key functions, including: Monitoring progress on the targets to facilitate swift, evidence-based decision making Raising awareness and empowering consumers by increasing transparency of product sustainability characteristics Increasing the energy- and resource-efficiency of various processes through automation and digitalisation. To unlock the full potential of the new technological landscape, the rollout of 5G infrastructure will be a prerequisite for the EU\u2019s digital transformation The Green Deal is tied to major funding and trade initiatives The Green Deal arguably began as environmental policy, but it is now much bigger than that \u2013 an EU-wide set of policies, action plans and principles that are tied to major funding and trade initiatives. For example, although the Covid-19 pandemic set back the implementation timeline for the Green Deal, the European Recovery Fund \u2013 which EU leaders agreed on in July in response to the pandemic \u2013 gives an additional boost to the agenda by unlocking further funding and helping the EC ensure that recovery plans and the Green Deal are aligned. The Green Deal also gets a major source of financing over the next decade from the EUR 1 trillion Sustainable Europe Investment Plan. Roughly half of this amount will be provided directly from the EU budget. The remainder will be mobilised by the InvestEU programme, which is designed to align financial support from the EU, development banks, national governments and private investments. In addition, the Green Deal is central to the EU\u2019s foreign relations strategy. The Green Deal is closely aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement, and the EC hopes to encourage other regions to follow its path towards sustainability in support of these ambitions. Diplomatic engagement and strategic partnerships will be an essential part of this effort, as will the EU\u2019s trade policy \u2013 the EC proposes that all future trade agreements include a binding commitment to ratify and effectively implement the Paris Agreement. The Green Deal represents such a profound shift from how the EU\u2019s economy currently functions that it has been dubbed \u201cEurope\u2019s man on the moon moment\u201d. It will have significant implications for millions of EU citizens but will also create opportunities for those private investors willing to contribute towards making this vision a reality.

But this could provide a tactical opportunity for investors to add risk to portfolios, or to further diversify their holdings. Key takeaways The build-up to a US election is typically characterised by market volatility, and this year it has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic; any legal or constitutional challenges to the election result would likely add to market uncertainty President Trump\u2019s Covid-19 diagnosis adds greater uncertainty to an already volatile period \u2013 but volatile markets could provide investors with tactical opportunities If we see a definitive election result and favourable developments in the fight against Covid-19, we expect a broader set of sectors and regions to benefit in 2021 \u2013 beyond the large-cap US tech stocks and growth themes that have done well this year Load More "

        "content": " Active is: Thinking long term, today 3 policy differences for investors to watch in the US presidential race 11/09/2020 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary President Trump and former Vice President Biden have notably different views about corporate taxes, energy and US-China trade, which may have a substantial impact on markets and portfolios. Key takeaways President Trump and his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, have pronounced policy differences on corporate taxes, energy and US-China trade, but generally similar views around drug pricing, large-cap tech firms and infrastructure investment The run-up to a US presidential election can be volatile: markets have historically done worse in the weeks before election day than in the period from election day to year-end While large-cap US technology stocks have led all market sectors during the Covid-19 crisis, a wider set of geographical regions and sectors may benefit from the coming economic rebound Emerging technology (including 5G, AI and cybersecurity), infrastructure and clean energy may have a strong outlook following the election Corporate taxes, energy and US-China trade could affect portfolios the most As the 3 November US presidential election draws closer, the race is tightening between Mr Trump and Mr Biden. While much is at stake in this election cycle, the three policy areas noted below could have a large impact on the markets and portfolio allocations. Investors should plan to adjust portfolios depending on the direction of policy after election day \u2013 though emerging technology and infrastructure may be winners regardless of the outcome. Corporate tax policy: while Mr Trump\u2019s corporate tax policies are ostensibly more market-friendly, Mr Biden\u2019s plan may be offset by other growth initiatives Mr Biden wants to reverse the Trump administration\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% (while keeping it below the pre-2017 rate of 35%) and creating a minimum 15% tax for corporations earning USD 100 million or more. He also plans to double the tax rate for foreign subsidiaries of US firms. These policies would likely hurt earnings for sectors that benefited the most from Mr Trump\u2019s tax cuts (including financials, consumer staples and utilities) as well as large multinational companies with overseas operations (including technology and healthcare). However, Mr Biden does plan to invest in growth areas such as clean energy and 5G technology. Moreover, the US economy is recovering from recession, so Mr Biden may not make tax hikes an immediate priority \u2013 and there is no guarantee they will pass, especially if Congress remains divided. Mr Trump wants to maintain the status quo. The corporate tax cuts he implemented in 2017 were designed to be permanent, and he also likely wants to turn the temporary tax cuts for individuals into permanent ones. However, much depends on which party controls the US Congress after the elections \u2013 a Democratic Congress would be much less receptive to Mr Trump\u2019s tax proposals. Energy policy: a Biden presidency could create opportunities for clean energy, while another Trump term would support the existing energy regime Mr Biden plans to invest heavily in areas like renewable energy and climate protection. His policy calls for a USD 2 trillion investment in solar, wind and other clean-energy sources, as well as incentives for manufacturers to produce zero-emission electric vehicles and energy-efficient homes. Mr Trump\u2019s plan focuses more on traditional energy sources such as oil, natural gas and coal \u2013 which account for over 80% of total energy used in the US (vs 10% for renewable energy). He would provide a friendlier tax and regulatory regime for traditional energy, as well as continued support for \u201cfracking\u201d \u2013 a drilling technique use to extract oil or natural gas from underground. The Trump administration believes its energy policies have made the US less vulnerable to shocks from the Middle East or OPEC. US-China trade policy: both candidates would be \u201ctough on China\u201d and aim to strengthen US tech leadership over China President Trump has made US-China trade a priority of his administration \u2013 often acting unilaterally or via executive order. The two countries did agree on a Phase 1 trade deal on 15 January, but tensions have since resumed over the pandemic and the business practices of Chinese technology firms. In a second term, Mr Trump would likely continue his tough rhetoric and uniliteral approach, perhaps spurring market volatility in the years ahead. Mr Biden has also pledged to be \u201ctough on China\u201d but has indicated he prefers building coalitions \u2013 bringing US allies, labour groups and environmental organisations to the negotiating table. His administration would likely also view Chinese-led technology firms less favourably; Mr Biden proposes a USD 300 billion investment in US technology spending (including 5G, AI and cybersecurity) to remain competitive with the Chinese (see chart). President Trump would likely favour continued US leadership in technology as well, although he has not confirmed any new policy measures to support this. Mr Biden proposes spending on climate change, infrastructure and \u201cbuy American\u201d support for tech Key components of Biden\u2019s spending proposal (in USD billions) Source: Biden for America as at September 2020. The two candidates have similar views on drug pricing, tech giants and infrastructure Despite their many differences, Mr Biden and Mr Trump are aligned in some areas that markets may not appreciate. For example, both candidates support some form of lowering pharmaceutical drug prices. Both also favour more regulation of \u2013 and have even called for breaking up \u2013 certain large US tech firms. And both hope to pass substantial US infrastructure packages, supporting areas like smart cities, roads and airports \u2013 though Mr Biden also supports developing clean-energy infrastructure. The global pandemic is the big wild card in this election year Historically, markets have done worse in the weeks before election day than in the period from election day to year-end (see chart). This is likely because the markets don\u2019t like uncertainty: once an election is over, the markets are able to start factoring in the next president\u2019s policies. Equity performance has historically been stronger after presidential elections Average S&P 500 performance before and after presidential election years (since 1970, excluding 2008) Source: FactSet as at September 2020. The above chart is illustrative in nature and not indicative of future results. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. At the same time, the global Covid-19 pandemic makes this a very unusual election year for the markets. While the presidential candidates spar over how they would approach the pandemic, the markets are processing new data points about regional outbreaks, vaccines, drug therapies and the pace of economic recovery \u2013 in addition to the level of monetary and fiscal support that has provided a floor for markets so far. If the global economy does rebound in the next 12-18 months, we expect to see broader sector and geographical participation in the market\u2019s upside \u2013 beyond the large-cap US technology stocks that have led through the crisis. Investors may want to factor this in, along with the candidates\u2019 proposals, to consider allocations to select sectors. Cyclicals (such as select industrials, energy and financials), emerging technology with long-term growth potential (such as 5G, AI and cybersecurity), infrastructure and clean energy may all be potential winners in a post-2020 US election era. 1321342 Want to view more?

China\u2019s GDP growth will help other Asian economies to different degrees, but virus containment is key China\u2019s growth has rebounded sharply following the first-quarter downturn prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic (see Chart 1). We believe China\u2019s recovery will continue, though at a more moderate pace than was seen in 2Q20. The successful containment of the outbreak was the biggest factor in sustaining a functioning economy, though the government\u2019s swift and targeted stimulus measures also helped. We think the Chinese authorities will continue to keep interest rates low and implement other accommodative policy measures to support a steady economic recovery, though rates may not move much lower. China\u2019s ongoing recovery should be good news for several other Asian economies \u2013 primarily those that are most closely linked to China and have had similar success in containing Covid-19. Chart 1: China\u2019s growth rebounded sharply in 2Q20 Source: NBS, CEIC, AllianzGI Economics & Strategy, as at June 2020. Hong Kong and Taiwan are likely to benefit most from mainland China\u2019s recovery According to the Trade-in-Value-Added database compiled by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and WTO (World Trade Organization), 9.6% of Hong Kong\u2019s GDP is generated by demand from mainland China. This means a 10% increase in mainland Chinese demand, everything else being equal, would likely lift Hong Kong\u2019s GDP by just under 1 percentage point. The sensitivity of Taiwan\u2019s GDP to mainland Chinese demand is even higher. As Chart 2 shows, a recovery in domestic demand in mainland China would likely benefit economies like Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea the most. This is thanks to the close trade links in goods and services that these economies have established with mainland China relative to the size of their own GDPs. For example, China imports from South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia many technological items such as semiconductors and other intermediate components which underpin its rapid technological advances, and much of Hong Kong\u2019s revenue from tourism and trade services comes from mainland China.

India and Indonesia may see less of a benefit from China\u2019s rebound, especially since the number of Covid-19 cases is still growing in both Domestically oriented economies such as India and Indonesia are relatively less sensitive to a recovery in Chinese domestic demand. This is because of the comparatively smaller weight of trade with mainland China-as a proportion of their own GDP. In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic isn\u2019t yet abating in India, Indonesia and the Philippines (see Chart 3). This is subduing economic activity.; Chart 3: India, Indonesia and the Philippines are still seeing rising Covid-19 infections Covid-19 confirmed cases to date Source: Johns Hopkins University, Morgan Stanley Research, AllianzGI Economics & Strategy, as at July 2020. Thailand and Malaysia rely on tourism, which will take time to return to usual levels Both the Thai and Malaysian economies have so far controlled Covid-19 better than their peers, successfully flattening the new infection curves. But we do not expect a swift recovery since both Thailand and Malaysia rely greatly on tourism (see Chart 4) \u2013 a sector that is likely to continue to be hampered as a result of reduced international travel. Chart 4: Thailand and Malaysia rely greatly on tourism revenues Source: CEIC, HSBC, AllianzGI Economics & Strategy, as at December 2019. South Korea and Taiwan are in a much better position than their south Asian peers thanks to their progress so far in controlling Covid-19 and their economies\u2019 focus on technology exports Export growth has been recovering faster than anticipated, due to the world\u2019s increased reliance on technology during the pandemic. The increase in working from home has helped drive demand for servers, laptops and other communication technology products (see Chart 5). Chart 5: South Korea and Taiwan\u2019s exports are supported by technology products Electronics & Electronic product exports (% yoy, 3mmav) Source: CEIC, AllianzGI Economics & Strategy, as at June 2020. Investment implications In equities, consider North Asia over South and South-East Asia We suggest staying overweight in North Asian equity markets (mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea) versus the South and South-East Asian markets (India, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia). The fact that the North Asian economies were typically more advanced in containing Covid-19 is key. Assuming there is no second-wave outbreak, these economies are likely to be at the end stage of the pandemic, moving towards economic recovery. We remain cautious on South and South-East Asian economies, in particularly India, Indonesia and the Philippines, as they are still fighting the spread of Covid-19. Keeping growth going may require increased fiscal stimulus, which will put pressure on central banks to deliver. Persistent growth is likely to require greater fiscal stimulus support, which in turn puts pressure on central banks to ease excessively and help finance government bond issuance. In fixed income, consider more exposure to Asian corporate credit for better yield enhancement With the very strong stimulus responses from the Fed and the resumption of growth in Asia, we think the risk of credit defaults in Asia should reduce considerably. This may prompt corporate credit spreads to tighten much more than sovereign and quasi-sovereign credit spreads, which we think have pretty much priced in the current circumstances. 1296538 Want to view more?

        "content": " Active is: Sharing insights 3 ideas for investors seeking diversification and growth potential 04/08/2020 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary After months of strong outperformance, US markets may face new challenges, including a resurgent coronavirus and political uncertainty. Our US Investment Strategist has three ideas for investors seeking diversification and growth potential: sustainable investing, private-market debt, and securities in Asia and Europe. Key takeaways US stocks have been leading the global market rebound after the March sell-off, but they now face several \u201cwalls of worry\u201d, including perhaps an overly dominant tech sector, heightened political uncertainty ahead of November\u2019s presidential elections and a resurgent coronavirus Investors may want to complement traditional US exposure with alternative assets that are poised for growth in the years ahead \u2013 and offer diversification, stability and yield potential The crisis has reinforced investor interest in sustainable investing and emphasised the environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors that help determine companies\u2019 resilience in challenging times Private markets such as infrastructure debt or Asian private credit can also offer exposure to stable assets (including roads and renewable energy), favourable yield profiles and potentially lower overall default rates Non-US markets \u2013 particularly those in Asia and Europe \u2013 could benefit from their success at battling the virus and from a softer US dollar; these regions can also offer investors exposure to growth (Asia) and value (Europe) Download a full PDF The coronavirus pandemic has taken equity and fixed-income investors on a roller-coaster ride this year \u2013 first with a remarkably rapid downturn, and then with a pronounced rebound. But the US stockmarket rally since the lows of 23 March has been largely concentrated in a few sectors, including those that benefited from a boom in remote work (particularly US large-cap tech stocks), defensive assets (including US investment-grade bonds and gold) and, to some extent, equities in China (see Chart 1). Chart 1: the NASDAQ and China\u2019s equity markets have outperformed most global indices this year Global equity index performance (year to date; indexed to 100) Source: Bloomberg. Data as at 28 July 2020. Charts are provided for illustrative purposes and are not indicative of the past or future performance of any Allianz Global Investors product. Heading into the final quarters of the year, investors in US markets face several potential headwinds. Large-cap tech stocks and the tech-heavy NASDAQ moved up more than 15% between January and July and may experience more volatility in the near future. In addition, the reopening of the US economy was expected to support cyclical stocks, but this rally hasn\u2019t occurred yet. It may not happen until a viable coronavirus vaccine is available, or until the healthcare outlook in the US and emerging markets improves. Meanwhile, investors overall \u2013 particularly those seeking income \u2013 are also facing extended periods of historically low rates globally. Plus, market uncertainty and volatility has historically risen before the US presidential election \u2013 particularly in the weeks prior to election day. And many investors still hold elevated levels of cash on the sidelines, earning zero or even negative yields. Against this backdrop, where can investors turn if they are looking for alternatives to traditional US equities and bonds? Here are three ideas that could offer investors portfolio diversification, stability and yield potential \u2013 and importantly, appear to be set up for future growth. Sustainable investing is positioned well for the future The crisis has renewed investor interest in sustainable investing \u2013 for example, by focusing on the environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors that can help determine companies\u2019 resilience in challenging times. There\u2019s also greater emphasis on how the recovery from the coronavirus crisis can be a \u201cgreen\u201d one, as countries seek to ensure that their long-term investments \u2013 particularly in infrastructure \u2013 also support sustainability goals. Why sustainable investing now? The ESG space has held up quite well during the market volatility we\u2019ve seen this year (see Chart 2), perhaps because the coronavirus pandemic seems to have accelerated many ESG-related trends that were happening already. Companies and governments have noted that the shutdown created a large drop in carbon emissions around the world \u2013 prompting debate about how to turn this sudden shift into more lasting change. Sustainable investing is also now at the forefront of many policy and stimulus debates as well \u2013 including the recent announcement of Europe\u2019s EUR 750 billion recovery fund (a coronavirus stimulus package focused on digitalisation and climate protection), and the policy proposals by US presidential candidate Joe Biden centred on clean energy. In today\u2019s business environment, board diversity and executive compensation are also under scrutiny. Chart 2: ESG investing has outperformed this year MSCI USA ESG Leaders Index vs S&P 500 Index (year to date; indexed to 100) Source: Bloomberg. Data as at 28 July 2020. How to implement this idea: look for ESG-integrated strategies and/or impact strategies Consider investing in strategies that focus on ESG factors not only as an additional layer of risk management, but for growth potential. Also consider sustainable strategies or \u201cgreen bonds\u201d as part of an allocation to impact investments. Impact strategies have a clear and quantifiable causal connection between the investment they make and the resulting impact. (Green bonds specifically raise funds dedicated to projects that have a positive environmental benefit.) Private-market alternatives lend themselves well to long-term investors While traditional portfolios can frequently follow a \u201c60-40\u201d equity-bond mix, we believe there is room for private-market alternatives \u2013 perhaps with allocations of 15% or more in the institutional space. While less liquid, these asset classes can offer the potential for stability, growth, high credit quality, and often outsized yields or returns to compensate for their illiquidity. Examples include asset classes like private credit, and infrastructure debt and equity: Private credit is generally a form of non-bank lending provided when credit is not available in public markets; it can also refer to senior secured credit and direct lending. Infrastructure debt provides investors with access to stable, defensive infrastructure assets like roads, ports, and renewable energy (wind and solar), as well as longer duration options to match liabilities (at higher yields than traditional fixed income), and lower overall probabilities of default versus traditional corporate bonds (see Chart 3). Chart 3: over the long term, infrastructure debt has low default rates Cumulative default rates for corporates and infrastructure investments (%) Source: Moody\u2019s, \u201cInfrastructure Default and Recovery Rates, 1983-2016\u201d. Data as at July 2017. Why now? This year may be particularly compelling for private markets as an asset class, as traditional equity and fixed-income markets have rallied substantially from the March lows. In addition, a small number of sectors (including large-cap technology) are driving market returns, which could lead to elevated volatility for stocks. Private markets, on the other hand, are usually much less volatile and may lend themselves well to long-term investors. There may be other timely benefits as well: Private debt can play a critical role in financing the recovery from the global slowdown caused by Covid-19. As alternative loan providers, private lenders can help make capital available when it otherwise might not be, while enabling end investors to support sustainable and inclusive growth. Infrastructure is also an area that both US leading presidential candidates have highlighted as a point of focus and investment \u2013 with candidate Joe Biden even proposing a USD 2 trillion green infrastructure initiative. How to implement this idea Given these trends, one private-market strategy to consider is infrastructure debt. As noted above, this sector tends to have outsized exposure to growth areas like renewable energy. Infrastructure debt also offers enhanced yield potential and a stable credit profile that may be attractive to fixed-income investors looking to diversify. And as noted below, another private-market option for investors to consider is Asian private credit. Look to Asia and Europe for interesting opportunities and valuations US financial markets have been a focus area for many global investors through the pandemic, driven in part by high levels of liquidity, sound balance sheets, and outsized exposure to Covid-19 \u201cwinners\u201d like technology and healthcare. However, for those investors who may want to diversify part of their US allocation, we would suggest considering other regions as well \u2013 particularly Asia and Europe. Why now? Increasing a portfolio\u2019s non-US exposure could make sense now for several reasons. First, as coronavirus cases and hospitalisations in the US have surged, and the re-opening has paused to some extent, we see notably better health trends in areas like China and northern Asia broadly, as well as parts of Europe. This has helped these economies stabilise more quickly. These regions are also supported by a softer US dollar, which has weakened substantially through the crisis. Second, from a sector perspective, parts of Asia tend to offer exposure to more growth areas like technology and communication services, while Europe generally offers more cyclical exposure, to sectors like financials, industrials and energy \u2013 both at more favourable valuations. As noted, Europe has also made substantial commitment to invest in areas like digitalisation and climate protection through its recently announced EUR 750 billion recovery fund. Overall, while markets in Asia and Europe have largely lagged the US so far this year, we see potential for global financial markets to play catch-up as we wrap up the second half of this year and head into 2021. How to implement this idea China and the north Asia region seem to be emerging from the coronavirus crisis favourably and are well-positioned for growth. Positive demographic trends in Asia are likely to be helpful for the healthcare, education and technology sectors \u2013 which may increasingly tap the Asian private credit market. More traditional investments for this region also include China A-shares in the equity space and Asian high yield in the fixed-income space. European markets are also attractive. These are more established markets with higher exposure to cyclical sectors and can offer opportunities \u2013 in both equity and select high yield \u2013 at relatively favourable valuations, particularly as the reopening continues globally. Europe also has been a pioneer in ESG strategies and seems poised to grow its leadership, so we favour impact-investing strategies levered to this growth.

Since then, bonds from higher-rated firms have been buoyed by central bank support. As the credit cycle turns, we suggest prioritising both issuer and security selection to seek outperformance \u2013 potentially with fallen angels and secured bonds. Key takeaways The risk/reward balance in corporate credit remains attractive, but less so than in March and April Multi-sector and high-yield strategies focused on relatively undervalued assets have the potential to outperform, whether the credit rally continues or turns out to be fragile Healthy and improving debt dynamics are critically important for issuer selection As we move into a new stage of the credit cycle, security selection will be key to adding relative value to credit portfolios Download a full PDF According to the Bank for International Settlements, 50% of firms globally may have insufficient cash flows to cover debt-related and operating expenses for 2020. This may push many credit investors higher up the rating spectrum as they seek to avoid potential distress in lower-quality credits. However, such an approach brings two main risks to performance. First, many of these higher-rated bonds are already back to trading close to par, or their full value. This means their prices are less likely to appreciate further, so investors may only get returns from the bonds\u2019 coupon payments. Second, high-yield investors may run the risk of not earning the full yield-to-maturity because issuers can \u201ccall\u201d, or redeem earlier, a large share of bonds to refinance the debt at lower rates. One possible solution is to invest selectively in so-called \u201cfallen angels\u201d \u2013 issuers that have been downgraded to high yield, but which may go on to regain investment-grade status. Seek out selective and defensive exposure to fallen angels Fallen angels consist largely of non-callable bonds that may offer relative value, in the sense that they trade at deeper discounts than would be suggested by their credit fundamentals and peers. Historically, fallen angels have outperformed the broader high-yield market, as illustrated in Chart 1. Chart 1: Over time, \u201cfallen angels\u201d have done better than high-yield bonds in general High-yield bond total returns (in %; weekly data; rebased to 100, December 2006 to July 2020) Source: Bloomberg, ICE BofAML indices, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 10 July 2020. See disclosure for index definitions. However, fallen angels in aggregate may not be offering quite as much value as they have in the past. As Chart 2 shows, fallen-angel credit spreads have not widened, or \u201ccheapened\u201d, as much in the current crisis as in 2008-2009, indicating that these issuers may offer less relative value than they did in the past. One possible factor behind this has been the unprecedented move by central banks to buy, or accept as collateral, bonds issued by fallen angels. By pushing up the prices of these bonds, this form of systemic stimulus can mask the remaining risks that are specific to each firm, and it can cap the potential for excess returns from fallen angels as a group. Research shows that only around one quarter of fallen angels make it back to investment grade, so it\u2019s important to take a highly selective approach when investing in these securities. Chart 2: Credit spreads have not widened as much as in the 2008-2009 crisis High-yield bond & CDS spreads (basis points; weekly data; December 2006 to July 2020) Source: Bloomberg, ICE BofAML and IHS Markit indices, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 10 July 2020. Bond spreads are option-adjusted (eg, to account for the early redemption risk of callable bonds) and indicate the yield difference between corporate bonds and equivalent-maturity government bonds. CDS index spreads indicate the price investors pay to insure against any of the index constituents failing to pay their debt. See disclosure for index definitions. Moreover, a defensive way to add to or to hedge fallen-angel exposure is through \u201clong\u201d or \u201cshort\u201d positions in corporate credit-default swap (CDS) indices. Long positions on these exchange-traded derivatives gain in value when there is an improvement in credit quality in the underlying unsecured bonds (which are insured against default by CDS contracts). CDS indices are relevant because fallen-angel and crossover securities tend to dominate CDS markets more than lower- or higher-rated securities. Also, CDS indices are usually more liquid than cash bonds, which can help CDS outperform as credit conditions improve. There is value within the secured bonds universe Secured bonds offer an alternative way to add relative value to credit portfolios, even if the segment may not look that attractive at first glance. Chart 1 shows that secured bonds have underperformed the fallen-angel universe and broader high-yield bond market \u2013 which are made up of approximately 5% and 20% of secured debt, respectively. Intuitively this makes sense. Secured bonds offer greater loss protection, so they should command a lower risk premium. They have seniority over unsecured bonds and are collateralised with company assets and other guarantees \u2013 which has historically given them much higher recovery rates (more than 65%) in the event of default. For example, when an issuer is downgraded from a BB to a B rating, its secured bonds can trade at credit (risk) spreads as much as 200 basis points lower than their unsecured counterparts. Moreover, secured bonds have shorter duration on average, which can help smooth the impact of longer-term volatility in interest rates and spreads. We think it\u2019s particularly worthwhile to look at secured bonds now because major credit downturns usually prompt companies to pledge various forms of collateral in order to attract financing, potentially making their secured bonds even more attractive. For instance, in 2009, following the global financial crisis, the proportion of new corporate debt accounted for by secured bonds rose by several multiples year-on-year. This credit-cycle downturn has been similar, with April marking a record high so far in the volume of secured bonds issued globally each month. However, unlike in 2009, credit spreads today more closely resemble those of the broader high-yield market. This means that on a loss- or recovery-adjusted basis, there will likely be bargains to be found within the secured bonds universe. This may be because many investors remain cautious, perceiving the increased issuance of secured debt as predominantly a sign of distress. But in a crisis as deep as the current one, healthier issuers are just as likely to issue secured debt as those that go on to default. Experienced credit managers with large research teams can often buy high-quality secured bonds at much higher-than-usual yields, especially in the primary market. Since March this year, we have seen at least two examples of new secured bond issues that subsequently paid off on a relative value basis. One firm with a B rating was under pressure to fund cash needs and refinance bank loans, so it issued new secured bonds at double-digit yields more typical of CCC rated debt. Another high-yield issuer needed to pay down existing unsecured bonds that carried higher coupons, so it tapped the primary market with secured bonds that were rated investment-grade but actually yielded more than comparable securities. Both issuers had at least one common characteristic: they did not issue as much secured debt in good times, leaving unencumbered assets at hand to pledge as collateral in bad times. A healthy loan-to-value ratio \u2013 ie, a relatively low level of debt compared to a company\u2019s secured assets \u2013 became an important metric to consider when future earnings visibility vanished as economies went into lockdown. Whether or not the credit rally continues, focus on relatively undervalued assets Looking ahead, the risk-reward balance in corporate credit remains attractive, even if less so than in the first quarter of 2020. Higher-quality high-yield credit may be more skewed to income than capital gains for now, but we still see significant upside and lower downside in select fallen angels and secured bonds. Focusing on relatively undervalued assets may be more likely to deliver outperformance, whether or not the credit rally continues. If credit spreads tighten further, identifying value relative to equivalent securities could help enhance returns for investors who feel they have missed out. Alternatively, if a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery does not materialise, repeated spread widening should push investors to prioritise liquidity and loss mitigation. Multi-sector and high-yield strategies \u2013 with a selective and defensive profile \u2013 have the potential to outperform in both scenarios. Download a full PDF 1252414 Want to view more?

Our US Investment Strategist has three ideas for investors seeking diversification and growth potential: sustainable investing, private-market debt, and securities in Asia and Europe. Key takeaways US stocks have been leading the global market rebound after the March sell-off, but they now face several \u201cwalls of worry\u201d, including perhaps an overly dominant tech sector, heightened political uncertainty ahead of November\u2019s presidential elections and a resurgent coronavirus Investors may want to complement traditional US exposure with alternative assets that are poised for growth in the years ahead \u2013 and offer diversification, stability and yield potential The crisis has reinforced investor interest in sustainable investing and emphasised the environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors that help determine companies\u2019 resilience in challenging times Private markets such as infrastructure debt or Asian private credit can also offer exposure to stable assets (including roads and renewable energy), favourable yield profiles and potentially lower overall default rates Non-US markets \u2013 particularly those in Asia and Europe \u2013 could benefit from their success at battling the virus and from a softer US dollar; these regions can also offer investors exposure to growth (Asia) and value (Europe) Download a full PDF Load More "

Our engagement project on gender diversity aims to find out why progress has not been faster, and to encourage the wider adoption of any initiatives to help close the gap. Key takeaways Research shows that greater gender diversity can raise companies\u2019 return on equity by increasing innovation and productivity The business case for gender diversity is not one-size-fits-all; active engagement helps companies to define their specific \u2018why\u2019 on gender diversity issue Corporate leaders in gender diversity typically understand the need for cultural transformation, and construct a pipeline of female talent that begins with graduates Our engagement shows that setting clear targets and key performance indicators is key to making more progress in gender equality Download the full report The number of people of working age in Japan is falling, but one way to mitigate this potential labour squeeze could be by increasing the proportion of women in the workforce. In 2019, women accounted for 44.5% of the Japanese workforce \u2013 a figure that has improved significantly in recent decades but is still lower than in most advanced economies. Yet if this gender gap were closed completely, according to a 2019 report from Goldman Sachs, Japan\u2019s GDP could increase by 10%. However, true gender diversity doesn\u2019t just mean achieving 50:50 representation; it also means more women being employed in senior positions, and here Japan lags other developed markets. Half of adult women in Japan are graduates, and a clear majority of those are working. But in 2018, only slightly more than 11% of the directors of private corporations were women, according to government figures. This statistic is largely the result of the traditional social expectations in Japan around a woman\u2019s role in family life, which prompt many women to take part-time or temporary roles after graduation. Gender diversity is good for businesses In our regular engagements with the companies, we strive to put the case for gender diversity. To explore this issue further and drive positive change, we ran a programme to engage specifically with Japanese companies about their approach to gender diversity. We summarise the key findings below, while more detail is available in our full report. The most important thing for companies to understand about gender diversity is that it\u2019s good for business. A more equal balance between men and women, in both junior and senior positions, generally results in: A larger talent pool of highly educated employees Diverse perspectives and less \u201cgroupthink\u201d Improved employee satisfaction As a proof point, the Nadeshiko Index, a joint government and Tokyo Stock Exchange benchmark featuring companies with an outstanding record in advancing women. The Nadeshiko Index has outperformed the broad-based Topix stock index over the past 10 years. Prioritising gender equality in our investment approach Our Japan Equity and ESG research teams talked to 21 Japanese companies between February and October 2019 about their gender balance and efforts to move closer to gender parity. As well as discussing policies and achievements, some of the companies we spoke with were willing to talk about the challenges, lessons learned from past mistakes and how they intended to hone their approach. Our conversations revealed four important takeaways: A well-defined business case is critical We found that many executives in Japan don\u2019t currently understand the business case for gender diversity. This makes it harder to create effective change, because in the absence of a well-defined rationale, work on improving diversity can descend into ineffective box-ticking. The companies that lead their industries in diversity have typically developed initiatives that link the advancement of women with advantages for the business. For example, a company that\u2019s anxious to diversify its primarily male customer base should strongly consider promoting more women into senior positions in product development, where they can offer different insights. Companies must transform their culture from the top down The diversity programmes that tend to be most successful in transforming corporate culture are those that are actively led by senior management. In changing corporate culture, effective two-way communication is essential. Some companies hold regular one-to-one meetings, where women can provide candid feedback to management about the effectiveness of diversity measures. These meetings can also allow management to offer guidance and encouragement, helping female employees to advance their careers. Employees can also benefit from practical support such as flexible working arrangements. A healthy pipeline of female talent is essential, starting with career-track graduates To achieve a greater number of female directors on the board in the long term, organisations must address the gender balance at all levels of seniority, including new graduates taking career-track roles. This builds a pipeline of female candidates for senior management and director positions in the future. Companies with good gender diversity practices, who take a proactive approach to building a robust female leadership pipeline, are more likely to attract and retain talent across the board \u2013 both male and female. Hard numbers are essential to track progress Japanese corporate disclosures usually describe policies to promote gender diversity, but they tend to avoid specific targets and key performance indicators. In our dialogue, we encouraged companies to adopt clear metrics and report on them regularly. This specificity and transparency will also allow outside stakeholders such as investors to measure progress over time. To that end, it\u2019s important to avoid generic ambitions: \u201cWe aim to continue improving diversity\u201d is too vague. Furthermore, the metrics used should be reviewed and changed as the business develops. We\u2019re optimistic about gender diversity in Japan While gender diversity in Japan\u2019s senior and career-track positions is still low, especially when compared with other developed markets, it\u2019s encouraging that Japanese companies were keen to engage with us on this topic because they understand how a better balance can benefit them. Active stewardship will play a critical role in accelerating progress. Direct engagement with Japanese companies on gender diversity sends a strong and clear message on the importance of this topic \u2013 from a business and investment perspective \u2013 while providing a platform to share any initiatives which have already proven effective in other Japanese firms. Through engagement, we will continue to support companies\u2019 efforts to improve gender diversity at all levels within the company, from graduates to board directors.

But how safe is this data? As more business activity and social interaction moves online \u2013 particularly in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 companies\u2019 approach to cyber security is being scrutinised. Through a dedicated engagement programme, we\u2019re helping to influence companies\u2019 policies and best practices in this area. Key takeaways Cyber-security incidents are on the rise, and regulators and investors are increasingly scrutinising companies\u2019 policies and protections, given the costly implications of these incidents To foster dialogue and compliance on cyber issues, we engaged 17 companies in the most vulnerable sectors, to understand their approaches and share best practices across these industries Our research highlighted the hallmarks of a robust approach to cyber security, including the need for companies to think about not just their internal systems but their wider ecosystem We plan to extend this engagement to other industries, because these issues are of growing and universal relevance as more business activity and social interaction moves online Cyber security is a growing concern for businesses, institutions and individuals, with a rise in incidents such as critical data breaches, ransomware and \u201cemail spoofing\u201d incidents, and operational breakdowns. The risks increase as more business activity and social interaction moves online \u2013 a trend that has been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic. A report by the security firm McAfee with the Center for Strategic and International Studies estimated the annual cost of cybercrime at USD 600 billion. And as the potential risks grow in scale and complexity, the costs will likely increase. Given the high stakes, cyber risks are attracting increasing regulatory scrutiny. Similarly, investors want to be confident that the companies in which they invest have the necessary protections in place \u2013 given that these risks can threaten their ability to operate and, ultimately, their existence. Our dedicated engagement programme To enhance and share knowledge on this topic, Allianz Global Investors has spent two years conducting a cyber-security engagement programme. Working with our portfolio managers, we selected 17 firms spanning financials, technology and the internet \u2013 sectors with a potentially high exposure to cyber risk, where we would expect to see comprehensive and robust protections. We found this engagement helpful in several ways, such as identifying companies with an elevated cyber-security risk, producing more accurate ESG risk ratings, and progressively embedding cyber-risk considerations into the investment case. Furthermore, driving more transparency around this topic is critical, as companies\u2019 current public disclosures on cyber-security may not allow investors to assess the risks fully. We summarise our key findings below, with more detail available in our full report here: Organisations that are advanced on this issue have a highly structured approach \u2013 These companies can identify, quantify and mitigate the risks (eg, through insurance) and they include provisions on their balance sheet. Maturity level is positively correlated with cyber resilience \u2013 Companies that have faced cyber risks for longer are likely to have more robust governance and security practices in place \u2013 not least because they have had to combat more live incidents. They also tend to have a larger budget allocated to managing those risks. Improved cyber security can be a competitive advantage \u2013 As rigorous cyber security becomes, in effect, a company\u2019s licence to operate, firms with a more robust and tested approach can likely have the confidence to move faster to seize new opportunities; this may favour firms with a simpler business model. Reputational damage can be the biggest cost \u2013 Losses due to cyber incidents range from operational interruptions to large fines and compensation payments, but the most material impact could be the damage to the reputation of affected companies \u2013 although this can be difficult to quantify. Businesses need to think about their entire ecosystem \u2013 Rather than focusing only on protecting their own assets, they need to address the threats that come from important stakeholders (such as infected client devices) and other third parties in the value chain. People can be the weakest link in cyber-security defence \u2013 A cyber incident is not necessarily a deliberate attack \u2013 an internal failure caused by human error or oversight can also cause system unavailability. From insights to positive stewardship outcomes While generating a wealth of insights, this type of engagement is constructive in several ways. It gives companies a better understanding of the information they should provide to help investors assess the risks related to cyber security. And it also contributes to continuous improvement in disclosure and practices. By tracking publicly available information on the 17 companies involved in the engagement, we found that six of them have improved their disclosures, risk management and governance. One company has appointed a chief information security officer; others have added a cyber-threat intelligence team or appointed a group data protection officer. Cyber risk management is increasingly likely to be included in firms\u2019 key performance indicators, and training is generally being improved on these issues. Next we plan to expand this project to other industries, given the universal relevance of these issues. We are committed to sharing knowledge and communicating our expectations to companies, as well as embedding cyber factors into our investment cases. Dialogue is critical to these goals.

New risks could emerge, but we continue to believe in the ongoing economic re-opening story \u2013 so cyclical sectors may remain market leaders in the near term. Markets could be supported further as elevated levels of cash are put back to work. Key takeaways Since the lows of this pandemic recession on 23 March, risk assets have rebounded impressively, with US equities and bonds up about 35% and 15%, respectively While this year\u2019s US equity rally was mostly dominated by the sectors that could be \u201cwinners\u201d in the coronavirus crisis (such as technology and healthcare), we have seen a remarkable broadening of leadership since mid-May: cyclical sectors such as industrials, financials and energy have outperformed We continue to believe in the re-opening story broadly, and we see a slow march towards normalisation in the US economy \u2013 perhaps punctuated by the arrival of a viable vaccine Against this backdrop, we believe a \u201cbarbell\u201d approach to risk would be prudent: focus on cyclical sectors during the re-opening phase, while considering adding tactical exposure to secular growth themes over time Investors should expect natural periods of consolidation in the coming months and be mindful of looming risks \u2013 from a second wave of coronavirus infections to the outcome of the US presidential election in November Risk assets have rallied since their 23 March lows, and the stellar May US jobs report released in early June provided yet another upside surprise. Non-farm payrolls were up 2.5 million versus an expected 7.5 million decline \u2013 a figure that sparked further market optimism. The market\u2019s reaction to this report also helped confirm the rotation in US markets that has been underway since mid-May: a pivot towards cyclical \u201claggards\u201d (such as industrials, financials and energy) and away from the \u201cwinners\u201d that fuelled the early part of the rally (such as technology, consumer staples and healthcare). But after digesting the surprising jobs report figures, the markets seemed to undertake a period of consolidation driven by two factors. First, there is a general view that markets went up too far, too fast \u2013 perhaps ahead of fundamentals \u2013 and were overdue for a correction. And second, there has been an ominous rise in coronavirus cases and hospitalisations in certain states in the US. Our view is that this broadening of the equity rally to include cyclical sectors was healthy, and that the virus outbreaks will be managed on a regional basis \u2013 without another shutdown of the entire US economy. As a result, as the economy re-opens, we expect select cyclical sectors to continue performing well in the near term, as the performance gap between the winners and laggards remains high. Longer term, we favour increasing tactical exposure to our ongoing secular growth themes as well. What could spark a further rally in risk assets? While periods of consolidation are natural, the risk rally may well resume once again. We will be monitoring both fundamental factors (including health developments and economic activity) and technical factors (which primarily revolve around market data) to identify renewed appetite for market risk. Fundamental factors to watch Good news about the virus curve.. We will watch for stabilisation in health data, and confirmation that state and local governments are taking action to contain flare-ups, including expanding testing and implementing contact-tracing programs. We would also hope to see continued containment of the virus in the epicentre of the US crisis, namely New York and New Jersey. A continued pick-up in economic activity. We would like to see ongoing improvement in economic and mobility data across consumer sectors, including retail stores, restaurants and hospitality. This would likely then also be reflected in economic metrics like retail sales and PMI (purchasing managers\u2019 index) data. Ongoing progress on therapies and vaccines. We hope to see more positive news and trial updates throughout the summer months. Ultimately, the development and distribution of a vaccine may be critical in restoring confidence and activity to pre-crisis levels. Another round of fiscal stimulus. We believe a new fiscal stimulus package (perhaps a final one) could be approved by both parties in Congress in late July, perhaps in the USD 1.5 trillion range. This kind of stimulus, which may include infrastructure reform, would have positive impact on both the economy and market sentiment. Technical factors to watch The S&P 500 Index\u2019s ability to stay above the 3,000 technical level. This is roughly the 200-day moving average, and the index moved above it in late May \u2013 which was a buy signal for some investors. It has approached this level in recent years but sustainably crossed it only once before \u2013 reaching an all-time high of 3,300 in early February \u2013 before falling back down. We will continue to monitor whether these levels can be sustained. Declines in above-average cash levels. Cash-heavy institutional and retail investors who missed at least some of this impressive rally in risk assets are still looking to play \u201ccatch-up\u201d in performance. More recently, retail cash levels have come down (as more retail investors have perhaps participated in the recent cyclical rally), while institutional levels remain elevated. Institutional investors are still holding large amounts of cash, though retail cash levels have recently dropped (Institutional money funds (ICI), $B / AAII, Asset Allocation Survey, Cash (%)) Source: St. Louis FRED, ICI, AAII, FactSet, 9 June 2020 A further drop in the VIX. The so-called \u201cfear index\u201d (the CBOE volatility index, or VIX) moved higher, back to the 30s, as we entered this period of consolidation. This is after spiking as high as 83 in March. But given that the VIX averaged 15 in 2019, today\u2019s levels still seem elevated. We will watch for additional declines as \u201cpeak fear\u201d may be behind us. Improvement in non-US markets. Globally, the S&P 500 Index remains the top-performing equity index year-to-date, in part because it provides liquidity and exposure to those companies \u2013 particularly in technology and healthcare \u2013 that have proved critical during the crisis. As markets move upward in the US, we are also watching to see whether emerging markets, Europe and Asia play catch-up, particularly as many of these markets continue to emerge from the pandemic, are exposed to cyclical sectors and also benefit from a softer US dollar on the margin. US equities have outperformed their global counterparts Source: FactSet, Allianz GI, 9 June 2020 What are the risks to our outlook? While there is reason for optimism, we are mindful of looming risks that could cast a shadow on our outlook. A second wave of coronavirus cases. With the US population becoming more mobile and gathering together in larger numbers \u2013 especially given protests and civil unrest \u2013 we remain concerned about a resurgence in cases, particularly in areas that were early to reopen. That said, the likelihood of another country-wide economic shutdown remains low, and we think rising cases may be handled on a regional basis. We remain watchful for state and local governments to implement forms of enhanced testing and contact-tracing as containment measures. A slow return to pre-crisis levels of economic activity and employment. While we expect the reopening process to boost economic momentum \u2013 perhaps throughout the summer \u2013 a return to full pre-crisis levels of economic activity and employment will likely take time, perhaps years. During this period, investors may grow increasingly wary, particularly if the market valuations remain historically expensive. For now, however, investors may be more focused on the economic reopening, on ongoing fiscal and monetary stimulus, and on accommodative interest rates globally. A resumption of US-China tensions. We may see continued tension between the two superpowers as we head towards the US election season. The US has claimed that China mishandled and misled global players during the coronavirus crisis, which China denies, and the future of Hong Kong has become a new source of disagreement. We will be watching closely for any US action around tariffs or trade, or a de-listing of Chinese equities specifically, as these would have broader market implications. So far, the rhetoric has escalated, but actions have been more measured. Market fallout from US presidential elections. Current polls imply an increasing likelihood that former vice president Joe Biden could emerge victorious in November\u2019s presidential elections. This may have implications for the market, as Mr Biden has spoken about increasing corporate and personal tax rates, and about rolling back some of President Donald Trump\u2019s banking deregulation. However, Mr Biden is not considered an anti-Wall Street candidate and would likely not alienate this part of his base. How should investors position portfolios for the road ahead? As noted above, we continue to see opportunities in cyclical stocks in the near term, but we still think secular winners are attractive on a long-term horizon (three to five years or even longer), and investors should consider adding exposure here on a more tactical basis when there are pullbacks and opportunities. Some sectors we favour on both sides are highlighted below. Consider the cyclical sectors tied to the \u201creopening\u201d Some of the more compelling risk-reward today may come from under-loved cyclicals, both in the US and globally: Travel and leisure. As consumers think about travel and leisure again, select airlines (which may have the backing of a fiscal bail-out), hotels, resorts and gaming companies may be winners. We expect to see more domestic travel at first, with international travel deemed harder and riskier. Parts of the energy complex. This sector has rebounded since the collapse of oil prices in mid-April. Areas of interest include renewable energy companies, which could grow more rapidly in the post-pandemic phase; natural gas companies, as telecommuting and cloud computing push up demand; and high-quality oil companies that survive the industry shakeout. Diversified financials. This category might include high-quality banks with large balance sheets. Also consider areas like private equity that can target distressed situations and even offer dividend yields, and financial information providers as trading volumes and capital markets deepen Med-tech and biotech. As elective procedures begin to re-open again, medical technology such as robotic surgery may be a winner. Biotechnology, such as gene and cell therapy, continues to be a secular theme. Maintain exposure to key technology sector themes We continue to prioritise secular growth themes in technology, particularly those parts of the tech sector that lend themselves to a longer-term \u201cstay-at-home\u201d world. These include wifi and 5G services, virtual access through the likes of remote education, video conferencing and e-gaming, and corporate IT infrastructure \u2013 such as cyber-security and cloud computing \u2013 to support a \u201cwork-from-home\u201d workforce. Healthcare and consumer sectors remain critical As we re-emerge from the pandemic, healthcare and consumer staples companies will play a critical role for consumers worldwide. In addition to those companies involved in the development of medical therapies and vaccinations, we would prioritise testing and devices, telemedicine \u2013 including the remote monitoring of patients and diagnostics. Consumer \u201cwinners\u201d could include food delivery companies, digital grocers and omni-channel retailers, as well as home improvement players. Opportunities across fixed income Finally, we also see opportunities across the spectrum in fixed income, particularly as the Federal Reserve stimulus programmes have supported credit markets in both the investment-grade and high-yield space. On the more defensive side, we favour areas like high-quality investment-grade, US Treasury and US dollar assets. We would also look to add risk in areas like select high yield \u2013 including short-duration and \u201cfallen angel\u201d strategies \u2013 convertible bonds (which offer upside via equity options) and select Asian high yield. 1210496 Want to view more?

This could represent the coming decade\u2019s most transformative development in global financial markets \u2013 and a major opportunity for investors. Key takeaways While it has been a challenging year so far, we expect China to resume its growth trajectory and become the world\u2019s largest economy by 2030 The previously export-led Chinese economy is shifting its focus to higher-value, tech-driven sectors, with growth fuelled by the country\u2019s burgeoning middle class Improved accessibility, governance and transparency have increased the appeal of Chinese A-shares to foreign investors Many indices underplay China\u2019s growth story; a lack of exposure to China could mean benchmark investors miss out As the world combats the coronavirus and confronts what many believe will be an epic recession, investors need to find new sources of growth potential. We think one answer is to look towards China \u2013 in particular, China\u2019s A-share equity markets. Investing in China is not without risks or controversy. China and the US are embroiled in a long-running trade dispute, and the coronavirus has added another dimension to existing tensions. The outbreak also slowed China\u2019s growth, just as it has impacted growth in the rest of the world. But the fact remains that China may be a fundamentally attractive investment opportunity for three key reasons: it has opened its markets to foreign investment, it offers compelling growth stories for investors, and it is executing a strategy to become the world\u2019s largest economy by 2030. Over time, this will likely add up to a structural investment trend of steadily growing exposure to China \u2013 and proactive investors may want to pre-empt that shift. China\u2019s markets are open for business China has undertaken a concerted effort to open its markets to international investors. The launch of the Stock Connect programme in 2014 facilitated access to China A-shares listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges \u2013 representing a total market capitalisation of around USD 8.5 trillion, which is comparable to the eurozone. In 2018, the inclusion of A-shares in two key MSCI indices \u2013 meaning that money that follows those benchmarks must buy Chinese stocks \u2013 significantly boosted inflows. The increasing institutionalisation of Chinese markets has also enhanced their appeal. Listed companies on the A-shares indices are now required to file quarterly reports, and more than half of the largest A-shares companies have embraced global accounting standards and employed international auditors. Greater transparency and improved governance have also helped counter the volatility that has characterised A-shares in the past, although investors should stay cautious. China offers compelling growth stories China\u2019s economy is changing. Once regarded as the world\u2019s factory, it is now focusing more on higher-value goods and services. With its \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d initiative, it has ramped up domestic production in sectors like biotech, automotive and semiconductors, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. Meanwhile, other high-value sectors, including tourism, have benefited from wider changes in Chinese society. The emerging middle class that drove the economy\u2019s pre-coronavirus growth should help fuel its tentative emergence from the outbreak, continuing China\u2019s transformation from an export-driven economy towards one with a greater focus on domestic consumption. The A-shares market offers investors access to small- and mid-cap companies within those high-value sectors that are set to be the future drivers of China\u2019s economic growth. China is on track to become the world\u2019s largest economy China doubled its GDP in the 12 years to 2020, with an average annual growth rate of 7%. A slowdown seemed inevitable even before the pandemic, largely due to China\u2019s rapid accumulation of debt since the global financial crisis and the government\u2019s desire to limit future credit growth. The coronavirus exacerbated these challenges, and in April 2020 China reported the first drop in economic output in more than 40 years, with first-quarter GDP 6.8% lower year-on-year. Amid continuing tensions with the US, China also announced it would not set a GDP target for 2020 \u2013 for the first time in 30 years. Although the IMF is forecasting 1.2% GDP growth for China in 2020 \u2013 significantly lower than previous expectations \u2013 most major economies are expected to shrink due to the coronavirus, including a projected 5.9% GDP drop in the US. Any positive growth in China would vindicate President Xi Jinping\u2019s long-term strategy and signify a resumption of the country\u2019s growth trajectory. How to invest in China For investors considering China, A-shares have historically displayed very low correlation with global markets, suggesting that investing in A-shares could bring additional diversification benefits. While the ongoing institutionalisation of China\u2019s A-share markets may result in higher correlations, this change will likely be a gradual process over many years. Because of domestic revenues and distinct economic and monetary policy, China A-shares have a low correlation with major equity markets As of January 31 2020. Correlation data is calculated based on historical return of respective MSCI indices for the past 10 years, using weekly USD return. See full names of all specific benchmarks at the end of this paper. Source: Bloomberg, Allianz Global Investors. Some investors will access the China growth story through benchmark exposures, now that major indices \u2013 such as the MSCI World \u2013 include A-shares. In our view, such an approach underplays the opportunity, because China represents only a small percentage of these indices. For instance, A-shares constitute 4.1% of the MSCI EM index \u2013 a proxy for global emerging markets \u2013 and just 0.5% of the MSCI ACWI ex-US index, representing international equity performance. This is despite China currently accounting for around 15% of total global economic output. Instead, a deliberate, active allocation may be key to seizing the full scale of the opportunity in China while managing the risks. Investors will likely benefit from an informed, connected partner with local knowledge and the agility of an active management approach. At Allianz Global Investors, we isolate stock selection as our key driver of risk and return, whatever the prevailing market conditions. We achieve this by using our own extensive proprietary research, supported by regular engagement with listed companies\u2019 management teams. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are now integrated into our China A strategy\u2019s investment process, applying another dimension of risk management. While China may be a controversial topic for some investors, we expect the country to continue its upward path and the world\u2019s investors are set to follow gradually. Now could be the time to get ahead of that trend.

Given the impending global recession, government bonds will likely continue to be attractive for now \u2013 although their yields will be low and liquidity concerns will make them volatile. But over the long term, we favour spread products such as investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds. Key takeaways We expect the US fed funds rate to remain low and possibly move lower, but we don\u2019t think these official rates will reach negative territory. However, market forces could push Treasury yields below zero. The coronavirus has added complexity to the economic outlook and made a global recession all but certain; in response, investors have flocked to the relative \u201csafety\u201d of government bonds Government bonds are more attractive than corporate bonds and other \u201cspread products\u201d in the immediate future; however, we prefer spread products over a longer time horizon As the extent of the global coronavirus crisis became clear in recent months, we made some adjustments to our outlook for global bond markets. However, our core convictions remain the same: (1) interest rates will likely remain low in the near term; (2) bond returns are set to stay low for years; and (3) we still prefer spread products to government bonds in the long run. 1. Interest rates seem likely to stay low for the foreseeable future There are compelling reasons for us to think interest rates will remain at or near their current very low levels for some time. The trend was apparent over recent years, even before the coronavirus hit: central banks have repeatedly showed their willingness to loosen the reins in the face of economic headwinds. And indeed, with a coronavirus-triggered global recession looming, major central banks have lowered rates dramatically, increased their bond purchases and provided additional liquidity provisions to stabilise markets. Even if the outlook for global economic growth improves \u2013 which is unlikely to happen in the near term \u2013 we don\u2019t anticipate any imminent change in the monetary policy of the two most important central banks (the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank). If anything, we expect them to make additional rate cuts or extend their bond-purchase programmes further. As central banks and investors alike buy up government debt, their yields could fall even more. When considering the future direction of bond yields, it\u2019s also important to note the relationship between high debt levels and low rates. Decades of \u201cloose\u201d monetary policy \u2013 including low rates \u2013 have lifted public and private debt levels close to record highs globally (see charts). One reason this has happened is the financial appeal of taking on cheap debt \u2013 including when corporations use it as leverage to buy back their own stocks. High levels of debt have historically curbed countries\u2019 longer-term economic growth, while making their central banks reluctant to raise interest rates to a \u201cnormal\u201d level for fear of hurting a private sector dependent on low financing costs. Clearly, the environment that central banks helped create is not going away anytime soon. Non-financial and government debt levels are near record highs ebt/GDP in % (developed markets on left, emerging markets on right) Source: Allianz Global Investors, BIS, Refinitiv. Data as at 31 March 2019. 2. We expect low bond returns over the long term In our view, there are two reasonable outlooks for bonds: yields will fall even lower, or yields will rise slightly but still stay low. Given fears of the growing \u201cJapanification\u201d of the government bond markets in Europe and ultimately the US \u2013 a reference to the low-growth, low-yield, low-inflation environment seen in Japan since the 1990s \u2013 some wonder if the Fed would even push rates into negative territory. (Interest rates are already negative in Japan and the euro zone.) We don\u2019t think US policy rates will turn negative, but Treasury yields may be different: they could be forced by market pressures into negative territory despite the Fed adhering to its \u201czero lower bound\u201d. However, with short-term rates having reached the lower bound, the downside for bond yields \u2013 and, therefore, the upside for bond prices \u2013 seems to be limited. It is possible that bond yields could rise slightly in the long run while staying relatively low. For example, prolonged trade disputes can be inflationary (though the current trade war hasn\u2019t increased inflation significantly) and bond investors could start pricing in the risk of higher inflation as a consequence of ultra-easy monetary policy. This would result in higher yields and lower returns, since bond prices move inversely to yields. Either way, we expect annualised returns on government-bond markets to be in the low single digits. Even in a climate of \u201cnormal\u201d interest rates \u2013 and we are nowhere near such an environment \u2013 central-bank rates would likely rise to only about 3% in the US, 2% in the euro zone and less than 1% in Japan due to low trend growth. At these levels, US debt would likely be more attractive than that of other nations, but it\u2019s unlikely that these low yields would meet most investors\u2019 long-term obligations. Policy rates set by major central banks are at low or negative levels Source: Refinitiv Datastream. Data as at 31 March 2020. 3. We prefer spread products to government bonds in the long run When yields are low and the economy is not entering a recession, the more attractive segments of the bond market tend to be the ones that offer additional income potential over government bonds in exchange for taking on additional risk. Spread products are a good example: their extra yield potential (or \u201cspread\u201d) is meant to compensate investors for taking that risk. These are not normal times, however, and spread products as a category may not generate enough income to compensate investors for taking more risks (though proprietary credit research may help mitigate them). However, over the long term, we find credit and illiquidity risk to be worth taking. We estimate that compared with a government bond index, investment-grade corporate bonds could offer additional return potential of around 70 basis points, and high-yield bonds could offer an extra return of 200 basis points. (A basis point is 1/100 of a percentage point.) The current environment is challenging. Growth prospects are unclear, the coronavirus outbreak is continuing to spread around the world and central banks could still change their monetary-policy approaches. We have seen several bouts of ambitious valuations hit the bond market as investors drove up prices and pushed yields further down. Portfolio decisions should be adapted actively in response to these difficult conditions. 1133705 Related documents Bond investors should expect continued low yields and low returns Want to view more?

Given the impending global recession, government bonds will likely continue to be attractive for now \u2013 although their yields will be low and liquidity concerns will make them volatile. But over the long term, we favour spread products such as investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds. Key takeaways We expect the US fed funds rate to remain low and possibly move lower, but we don\u2019t think these official rates will reach negative territory.

        "content": " Outlook & commentary 20 years into the 21st century, here\u2019s what investors need to know by Neil Dwane | 24/01/2020 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary In the last two decades, the global economy experienced major transformations. Here are some of the top stories from the start of the 21st century \u2013 and what investors can learn from them. Key takeaways Over the last 20 years, globalisation was a boon to markets and investors; so was central-bank support, even though it quickly grew to unprecedented and perhaps unsustainable levels High-tech advancements have already transformed the world and will continue to do so; in the coming decades, investors should look to Asia\u2019s young, tech-savvy population for investment opportunities Significant political shifts have occurred in the last 20 years: policies that fight climate change and inequality have gained support, and anti-globalisation sentiment is also on the rise Investors will need to take careful risks in today\u2019s low-yield, slow-growth environment, but they may also want to be contrarian and deploy capital judiciously as the end of the financial cycle approaches Central-bank support first saved the global economy, but then encouraged bad behaviour What changed in the last 20 years? Central banks steered the global economy through periods of major upheaval \u2013 the dot-com bubble, the financial crisis, the euro-zone crisis \u2013 by driving down interest rates and pumping greater levels of stimulus into the financial system. Central banks have maintained this \u201cloose\u201d monetary policy even though economic growth has re-emerged, albeit at a low and slow level. But maybe of more concern, policymakers haven\u2019t been able to create enough inflation globally even though prices have soared for equities, real estate and other asset classes. The markets are now all but \u201caddicted\u201d to central-bank support. What could the future hold? Central bankers feel they have no choice but to keep rates ultra-low or even negative, even though this doesn\u2019t leave them much room for manoeuvre when the next recession or crisis hits. They may need to resort to more unconventional tools, such as adjusting their inflation targets or underwriting large increases in government spending. Moreover, politicians still need to fix the underlying structural issues in economies, including low productivity growth, businesses making bad investment choices and steadily rising overall debt levels. Why does it matter for investors? Too much monetary stimulus can jeopardise financial stability. When rates are low, risk-taking and debt levels rise, which can cause credit and asset bubbles. And when the economy eventually slows down, companies struggle to maintain their debt burdens and are run for cash \u2013 which raises the risk of defaults, lowers investment and can even reduce employment. If central banks can\u2019t fix some of the economy\u2019s deeper problems, governments may resort to fiscal stimulus in the form of increased spending or tax cuts. Central banks may be pressured to finance these initiatives by buying up more debt, raising the spectre of sovereign default if governments are unable to fulfil their obligations. Disruptive tech survived the dot-com bubble What changed in the last 20 years? The 1990s dot-com boom went bust in 2000 when investors saw that high stock valuations weren\u2019t backed up by profits. But the tech sector survived, and it\u2019s prospering today. Mobile computing, e-commerce, cloud computing and social media have transformed how people work and live, and Big Tech companies have become some of the largest corporations in the world. What could the future hold? Big Tech firms may become even more powerful unless governments rein in their excesses. Advances in artificial intelligence and robotics could transform entire industries, underscoring the need to evolve our educational system to support a high-tech workforce. New technologies could expand the \u201csharing economy\u201d (car sharing, holiday rentals, etc) but also grow the \u201cgig economy\u201d as people increasingly turn to online platforms to find employment. As more people work on a day-to-day or project-to-project basis with fewer benefits and job protections, we could see inequality increase further. Why does it matter to investors? There are many ways in which high-tech disruptors could be disrupted: investors could discover that some firms have spurious valuations, and governments could cramp their business models with new regulations and new \u201cdigital taxes\u201d on e-commerce revenues. Investors will need to use fundamental research and stay active as they seek to separate the winners from the losers. The tide shifted from deregulation to re-regulation What changed in the last 20 years? In the early 2000s, the global economy and financial markets were still enjoying the fruits of decades of deregulation and globalisation. China gained entry to the World Trade Organization in 2001, emerging markets expanded, and deregulation helped companies maximise returns and share prices. But the 2008 global financial crisis stalled this momentum \u2013 and Japan, Europe and much of the world has struggled to recover since then. What could the future hold? Politics has a cycle, and many governments are feeling pressure to rein in corporations and renegotiate trade agreements to fix what some view as the excesses of the previous decades. We expect to see more re-regulation overall \u2013 though not necessarily in the US if President Donald Trump is re-elected. We also expect to see more policies that address the growing inequality of income, wealth and education. Why does it matter for investors? As regulations increase, investors should expect lower returns, reduced innovation, and more policy uncertainty and bureaucracy. This could all hurt stock prices. The US and China moved from globalisation towards nationalism What changed in the last 20 years? US consumers helped drive global growth until the US economy slowed. Then China stepped in and powered the world\u2019s economy for a time \u2013 although its debt levels skyrocketed as a result. But today, anti-globalisation sentiment is on the rise and the geopolitical environment is growing increasingly tense \u2013 particularly between the US and China. What could the future hold? Both the US and China will likely focus more on what\u2019s happening within their own borders \u2013 as evidenced by President Donald Trump\u2019s call to \u201cmake America great again\u201d and President Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d initiative. Even if some US-China trade tensions subside, we expect their relationship to become increasingly strained. What does it mean for investors? As more countries operate in their own national self-interest, rather than as contributors to a global economic system, we expect to see slower global growth. Corporate profit margins could also fall as tariffs and wage hikes increase the cost of doing business. Leading exporters will need to change their economic business models \u2013 which China is already doing. Global trade is likely to experience more friction, and we could even see currency wars spread as countries devalue their currencies to gain a trade advantage. Baby boomers gave way to millennials What changed in the last 20 years? Baby boomers (born between the mid-1940s and mid-1960s) began retiring by the millions, removing experienced employees from the workforce and straining social safety nets. Meanwhile, millennials (born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s) began entering the workforce in droves, but high student debt levels and stagnating salaries have made it harder for them to save money and buy homes. In fact, data from the Federal Reserve show that when the median age of US baby boomers was 35, they possessed 21% of the wealth of the US. While millennials constitute a smaller proportion of the US population and won\u2019t reach a median age of 35 until 2023, they currently hold only 3% of the nation\u2019s wealth. What could the future hold? Economic power may not transfer from boomers to millennials, but political power will. This will continue to change the direction of politics, as shown by the growing concern of millennials about climate change. Over time, younger voters will make their wishes known at the polls and put enormous pressure on corporate management teams and politicians \u2013 likely pushing for policies that are less centrist than those of their boomer predecessors. What does it mean for investors? Politics and business will continue to be disrupted by the changing consumer patterns and priorities of millennials. This is a dynamic population that is mobile and tech-savvy. Asia in particular is well-positioned to experience a boom that doesn\u2019t come from baby boomers: the median age of the 4.6 billion people in Asia is 32, according to data from the UN. Meanwhile more developed economies such as Japan and Europe are ageing rapidly. Sustainable investing has reached a tipping point What changed in the last 20 years? Sustainable investing has evolved from a trend into an important part of how portfolios should be managed. Investing sustainably means incorporating non-financial inputs \u2013 such as environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors \u2013 to seek to generate sustainable outcomes as well as strong financial returns. What\u2019s behind this shift? Climate change has been a major motivating factor, but sustainability is broader than that. For example, companies that address issues such as executive pay can help improve their competitive positions over the long term. What could the future hold? We expect to see voters pressure governments to find real solutions to climate change. We also want to see shareholders and boards encourage management teams to operate their businesses in a more sustainable way. Asset managers will likely continue to drive capital towards sustainable companies and projects that address what investors view as some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges. What does it mean for investors? Investors are seeing proof that sustainable investing can help them manage risk and improve return potential, and we believe that interest in this area will continue to grow. There are many ways to make sustainable investing a core part of an investment approach: incorporate ESG risk factors into decision-making; focus on sustainable and responsible investing (SRI); align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals; or invest for impact by using capital to address real-world issues. Perhaps investors can help jump-start a new \u201cclimate race\u201d that results in ground-breaking, productivity-boosting innovations \u2013 similar to how LEDs and solar cells came out of the 1960s \u201cspace race\u201d. Traditional long-only investing ceded ground to passive and alts What changed in the last 20 years? The US equity market continued its epic bull run, but equity markets in the UK, Europe and Japan aren\u2019t much higher than they were two decades ago. Fixed income has done very well, benefiting from central banks\u2019 largesse, but the global hunt for income continues amid historically low yields. And there has been a dramatic shift in investor preferences across all asset classes as investors flocked to index-tracking passive investments and non-correlated alternative investments. What could the future hold? Asset managers will likely feel more pressure to lower costs, and active managers will continually need to prove their worth. But as market returns (beta) fall, investors may increasingly value the excess returns (alpha) that active managers seek to provide. What does it mean for investors? In a low-yield, slow-growth environment, investors will need to take risk to earn a sufficient return. This may drive a wholesale rethinking of what constitutes the \u201cright\u201d portfolio construction \u2013 but investors must be cautious. They will need to be aware of following the herd into popular investments, particularly as the end of the financial cycle approaches. 1064997 Want to view more?

        "content": " Active is: Sharing insights What US-Iran tensions mean for investors by Neil Dwane | 16/01/2020 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary The financial markets are signalling that the situation in the Middle East won\u2019t get out of hand, but US-Iran friction could continue for some time. The defence industry and oil and gas-related sectors could remain well-supported, but overall we believe investors should be cautious yet patient. Look to higher-quality stocks with lower correlations to the broader market and \u201chunt for income\u201d if headline volatility is a risk you wish to avoid. Key takeaways Despite a slight cooling of tensions in the Middle East, there remains potential for further escalation in the region Oil prices have been relatively stable, but any further disruption in the Middle East will push them higher, acting as a headwind to global growth Investors should look to investing in higher quality stocks and bonds with lower correlation to markets We have been keeping a watchful eye on the Middle East for some time, mindful that any flare-up in tensions could roil global markets. That spark may have come in recent weeks, with the US and Iran edging towards military conflict. The reaction of financial markets suggests that the situation won\u2019t get out of hand, but even so, the face-off could still continue for some time. We think investors should prepare to ride out the initial volatility that ensues whenever there are new headlines, and be ready to reassess positions when signs of de-escalation occur. What happened? The US and Iran have escalated tensions in recent weeks. While it\u2019s reasonable to expect a prolonged confrontation between the two states, we believe that neither wants to start a full-blown war. Moreover, Iran has been weakened by continuing economic sanctions and may not be capable of major military action. But the situation remains unpredictable and the risk of further escalation between the US and Iran \u2013 and turbulence across the region \u2013 remains significant. What does it mean for the markets? While we are concerned that the Middle East has become a lot more complex in the last few months, the financial markets have been resilient and seem to be assuming the situation will not become uncontrollable. A pattern is starting to emerge in response to each escalation between Iran and the US: An initial sell-off on news of strikes or strong rhetoric from leaders.. A bounce-back once traders decide that the latest escalation is unlikely to affect the overall market narrative. The resilience we\u2019ve seen seems to be partly due to the fact that many investors are already defensively positioned, having used 2019\u2019s strong performance to reduce equity exposure and take profits. Overall, the global reliance on Iranian oil has lessened since the 1970s, making the scope for economic damage less ominous. Nonetheless, there has been some reaction in certain markets, most notably in flight-to-safety asset classes. Gold has returned to higher levels, the US dollar has strengthened, US Treasury yields have declined, and the aerospace and defence sectors have rallied since the flare-up in tensions. What does it mean for oil? So far, oil-price increases have been relatively modest: Brent crude prices spiked up about 4% on Monday before falling again on news of de-escalation. This was well below the 15% spike we saw in September after the Saudi Arabia oil-facility strike \u2013 and, notably, prices moved downward again fairly quickly after that episode. Further turbulence in the Middle East could create a risk premium for oil and cause disruption in the oil supply, pushing up oil prices and acting as a headwind to future global growth. Higher oil prices would also hurt most Asian economies which, with the exception of Malaysia, are net importers of oil. Our consensus view for 2020 is that the oil market is well supplied, with global demand weakish, but there is falling investment in Mexico, Brazil, the Middle East and the UK, offset only by Norway. US shale production looks unlikely to grow much more into 2021, so we see a high risk that more supply issues will surface. This could push prices up somewhat. What should investors do? In an environment of widespread political, structural and cyclical headwinds on the one hand, and lingering (though receding) support from monetary and fiscal policy on the other, we expect a continuation of the anaemic below-potential global growth trend in 2020. This rapid deterioration in the Middle East will certainly not help global growth, and it may have raised the near-term risk profile in Asian markets, despite a sanguine macro backdrop. In the face of uncertainty, we urge caution and patience. We suggest investors are ready to re- assess positions once signs of de-escalation in the US-Iran tensions can be seen. In the meantime, defence sectors, as well as oil and gas-related sectors, could do well, but investors\u2019 priority should be to maintain diversification, looking at higher-quality, less-volatile stocks with lower correlations to the broader market. 1053629 Want to view more?

Key takeaways Impact investing is one of the fastest growing sectors in the investment industry and is already worth USD 500 billion \u201cImpact washing\u201d occurs when a traditional investment is wrongly labelled as an impact strategy to benefit from the positive attributes connected with the trend The arrival of industry standard metrics will help identify impact strategies, and measure their performance \u201cBe the change that you wish to see in the world\u201d. Gandhi\u2019s philosophy could act as a guiding principle when investors define their approach to impact investing. According to the latest figures, this rapidly expanding market is now worth over USD 500 billion, making it one of the fastest growing parts of the investment industry today. As more investors look to allocate capital with the intention of achieving a defined and measurable \"impact\", the sector looks set to experience continued growth. That\u2019s great news for social and environmental innovators, who stand to benefit from money flowing into new technologies, and it\u2019s great news for responsible businesses that should see their positive business practices in environmental, social and governance (ESG) terms rewarded. But this rapid rise in demand is also threatened by a key risk \u2013 \u201dimpact washing\u201d. \u201cImpact washing\u201d - like its better-known cousin \u201cgreen washing\u201d - is when an impact fund labels \u201ctraditional investments\u201d as \u201cimpact investments\u201d in an attempt to benefit from the positive attributes linked to the trend. Ensuring we don\u2019t dilute or distort the definition of what constitutes impact investing before the market has really taken off is a key concern that needs to be actively addressed in order to safeguard sustained growth in investor appetite going forward. True, impact investments must focus on transparency and accountability of the effects achieved by the investment. This makes an investor's commitment to continuously measure and document the social and environmental effects of investments one of the most important features of impact investing. While investors seem to agree on the process steps required to carry out private impact investments, the quantitative and qualitative measurement itself \u2013 and the techniques used \u2013 are currently anything but standardised. However, promising initiatives such as the IRIS+1 from the Global Impact Investor Network, are looking to create such standards. At Allianz Global Investors, we have developed a stringent methodology in line with current best practice that allows us to measure impact. This methodology grew out of our belief that impact investments can deliver significant benefits to institutional investors and that these benefits are most likely to materialise when impact investments pursue a holistic strategy. For us, impact investments in private markets should be guided by three principles. First, the strategy must aim to have a positive effect in social and/or environmental terms and at the same time generate an attractive financial return. Second, there must be a causal link between the investment and the effect achieved. Finally, the effect must be identifiable and measurable. In addition, regular documentation must be provided to ensure the validity of the effect. Following these guidelines, we believe we can report the positive effects of our investments in a transparent and comprehensible way. When it comes to impact investing, \u2018being the change\u2019 demands that, as fund managers and investors, we can identify and measure the changes we are financing.

Investors may want to ready their portfolios for a higher rate of real-world inflation in the euro zone, perhaps by employing an actively managed mix of equities, real estate and commodities. Key takeaways The ECB seems to be focusing on an incomplete inflation measure, leaving out a key metric related to housing; unless the ECB fixes its approach, it may continue missing its official inflation target If the ECB factored key housing costs into inflation, policymakers might be able to address the kind of real-estate excesses that have historically helped trigger financial crises An incomplete inflation measure could expose bonds and other nominal assets to \u201cstealth devaluation\u201d; investors may want to consider real assets like equities, real estate and commodities as an inflation hedge During his eight-year tenure, European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi adopted an unprecedentedly expansive monetary policy that included negative policy rates and large-scale asset purchases, and contributed to the containment of disinflation. His like-minded successor, Christine Lagarde, seems set to continue his approach. But what if the ECB\u2019s obsession with disinflation (a decreasing inflation rate) is flawed because it overlooks a key factor: owner-occupied housing costs? If this turns out to be the case, it could mean euro-zone interest rates will remain too low for too long, and bonds could be exposed to a hidden loss of purchasing power. Inflation is in the eye of the beholder Several prominent euro-zone inflation gauges have painted a picture of subdued price pressure for the past 10 years: Consumer prices, as measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) \u2013 the preferred inflation measure of the ECB \u2013 rose by an average of 1.3% per year. The core inflation rate \u2013 excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco \u2013 rose by 1.1% per year. Both of these measurements significantly undershot the ECB\u2019s inflation objective of \u201cbelow, but close to 2%\u201d. Longer-term market-based inflation expectations have responded accordingly and dropped to new historical lows. But this \u201clowflation\u201d perception has not been shared by euro-zone consumers, whose inflation expectations have consistently outpaced official measures (see Chart 1). Chart 1: euro-zone consumer price inflation and inflation expectations Source: Bloomberg, European Commission. Data as at June 2019. Part of this gap is caused by official price measures underrepresenting lower- and middle-income households, who tend to face higher-than-average inflation due to their consumption patterns. These households tend to spend a higher share of income on \u201cfrequently purchased items\u201d like food, beverages and fuel, which are likely to be subject to stronger price increases. However, additional factors may also be at work. Disregard of owner-occupied housing costs The most important reason for a potential underestimation of real-world price pressure by the HICP has been that it does not factor in owner-occupied housing costs. Compared with many other countries, most notably the United States, these and other housing costs in the euro-zone index appear significantly underrepresented (see Chart 2). Chart 2: consumer price indices \u2013 item weights Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics, Eurostat. Data as at August 2019. Why are housing costs being excluded? The European Commission (EC) reviewed this topic in 2018 and \u2013 with the full backing of the ECB \u2013 cited two major factors: Because the HICP must cover actual monetary transactions of household final consumption expenditures only, extending its scope would lead to a highly controversial integration of asset prices in an index that should only reflect changes in goods and services prices. The available data about housing costs do not fulfil Eurostat\u2019s required standards of frequency and timeliness. Downward inflation bias We believe the EC\u2019s reasons for excluding owner-occupied housing from the HICP are questionable \u2013 and they can still be addressed: While residential property represents a grey zone between a long-lived asset and a service that provides shelter, we believe that buildings and structures (but not land) should be treated in line with other durable consumer goods (like cars or furniture) that provide utility over multiple years. The current lack of timely availability of a comprehensive dataset should not justify the omission of all homeowner shelter costs. As with other economic indicators, Eurostat could solve this problem by using a flash estimate based on a sample of preliminary data. Inclusion of owner-occupied housing (OOH) costs \u2013 which rose by 3.4% year-over-year in the first quarter \u2013 would have significantly lifted the recent euro-zone inflation trend (see Chart 3). Assuming the same share as in the US consumer price basket, headline HICP inflation would have run at an annual rate of 1.9% instead of 1.4%. In addition, the core rate in March 2019 would have been 1.6% instead of 0.8%. Chart 3: euro-zone core HICP Potential impact of owner-occupied housing costs Source: Bloomberg, Eurostat, Allianz Global Investors\u2019 own calculations. Data as at March 2019. Aside from housing costs, other factors may have contributed to the understatement of euro-zone inflation. For example, many durable goods have shorter life spans (a negative quality effect results from higher obsolescence), and items such as apparel undergo frequent fashion changes that can distort their prices. Eurostat has been ignoring these factors, which would otherwise have lifted inflation. At the same time, Eurostat has been accounting for other factors \u2013 such as quality-improvements \u2013 that dampen inflation. While the appropriate weight is certainly up for debate, it is clear that completely excluding OOH has pushed down official measures of consumer inflation. For example, one of the things that has puzzled economists is that inflation in the euro zone hasn\u2019t risen as expected given the lower levels of unemployment. This can be measured by the price Phillips curve \u2013 the relationship between labour-market slack and inflation \u2013 which has been surprisingly flat. The inclusion of OOH costs would go a long way towards explaining that phenomenon (see Chart 4). Chart 4: euro-zone price Phillips curve Not as flat as it seems if homeowner shelter costs are included Source: Bloomberg, Eurostat, OECD, Allianz Global Investors\u2019 own calculations. Data as at March 2019. Output gap = NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment) \u2013 actual unemployment rate. What underestimating inflation means for monetary policy The reliance on a narrowly defined and downward-biased inflation measure has contributed to the ECB adopting its ultra-expansive monetary policy with real-world impacts. Deposit rates are negative, and over the last five years there has been an unprecedented flood of liquidity from quantitative easing. But worryingly, by maintaining this expansive stance, policymakers may have missed the opportunity to regain some wiggle room by starting to normalise policy. Moreover, the ECB\u2019s reluctance to move away from its monetary-crisis mode has severely undermined its credibility and independence. This has given rise to fears of fiscal dominance, where monetary policy will be increasingly subordinated to fiscal-financing requirements. More subtly, by repeatedly drawing attention to low consumer price pressures and undershooting its price stability target, the ECB has helped erode longer-term inflation expectations of investors and economists. This has raised the risk that a more general disinflationary mindset could become a self-fulfilling prophecy over time. The answer may be for the ECB to adopt a more inclusive inflation approach, which would help the central bank to do two important things: Meet its objectives by capturing real-world inflation. Owner-occupied housing costs are highly sensitive to changes in monetary policy, so including them in price measures would lower the probability of a sustained over- or undershooting of the inflation target. Contain financial stability risks by strengthening the link between macroprudential policy and monetary policy. The rise in global asset prices over the past decade has been helped by unorthodox monetary policy, but the ensuing financial stability risks were primarily addressed by macroprudential policies such as countercyclical capital requirements or leverage caps for banks. Given that real-estate excesses have historically helped trigger financial crises, factoring housing costs into inflation measures would encourage the ECB to act pre-emptively with macroprudential and monetary-policy measures (commonly known as \u201cleaning against the wind\u201d) in times of a rapidly rising or falling real-estate market. Beware \u201cstealth devaluation\u201d and rising financial-stability risks The understatement of \u201ctrue\u201d inflation by official price measures is having far-reaching repercussions for investors, since bonds and other nominal assets could be exposed to a hidden loss of purchasing power. This \u201cstealth devaluation\u201d could aggravate the negative effects of financial repression, which helps governments reduce their real debt burdens but hurts savers. Accordingly, investors should consider making an appropriate strategic allocation to an actively managed blend of real assets such as equities, real estate and commodities, which may be able to provide a proper inflation hedge and a means of diversification. By continuing to focus on the incomplete HICP measure, the ECB faces an elevated risk of missing its official inflation target for several more years, despite running an overly expansive monetary policy. Against this backdrop, investors should be braced for a prolonged period of negative interest rates accompanied by rising financial-stability risks.

As such, we think the Fed won\u2019t take any chances and expect the central bank to announce a 25bp rate cut at its next meeting. Key takeaways We expect the Fed to cut the fed funds rate by 25 basis points at its 17-18 September Federal Open Market Committee meeting Faced with a still-robust economy and growing geopolitical concerns, Fed Chair Powell likely wants to avoid taking risk \u2013 preferring instead to keep monetary policy accommodative by lowering short-term rates We expect this will meet the market\u2019s expectations, and anticipate that long-term rates will stay firmly anchored at today\u2019s low levels The US economy remains robust, driven by household consumption, low unemployment and low inflation. Growth in the service sector had slowed in June and July but rebounded in August, with economic activity (as measured by the Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing report) at 56.4% \u2013 up 2.7 points from July. However, other recent cyclical data points, including a slowdown in job creation, suggest that growth may continue at a more moderate pace. It is unclear whether the internal dynamics of the US economy can compensate for the deterioration of the international environment. Trade tensions between the United States and China have grown worse, the risk of a hard Brexit persists and global growth has slowed down. Even though Fed Chair Jerome Powell dismissed the risk of recession in his recent statements, these downside global risks are at the heart of his concerns. In this power struggle between robust domestic growth and increasing international risks, we do not expect the Fed to take any chances. Instead, we expect the central bank to continue its accommodative monetary policy by keeping the cost of borrowing low. In line with its July announcements, we expect the Fed to confirm its intention to support growth by announcing a 25-basis-point cut in the fed funds rate (a basis point is 1/100 of a percentage point). Like the July cut, this would be a mid-cycle adjustment to support growth. We do not currently view it as an entry point to a cycle of rate cuts. For their part, the markets expect two rate cuts in 2019 and two more in 2020, and we believe these expectations will be met for the time being. The anticipated September rate reduction should allow long-term rates to stay firmly anchored at low levels, and should contain the appreciation of the US dollar. 949853 Want to view more?

        "content": " Active is: Anticipating what\u2019s ahead The ECB is getting its tools ready by Franck Dixmier | 06/09/2019 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary In recent months, the ECB made it clear that it will use all necessary measures to preserve growth and increase inflation in the euro zone. Since then, the political and macroeconomic environment has deteriorated, so we expect the ECB to announce new monetary-stimulus measures at its next meeting. Key takeaways We except the ECB to announce concrete monetary-stimulus measures at its 12 September meeting, in line with the comments it made in July Among the likely announcements are a rate cut, a new multi-tier deposit facility for banks and enhanced forward guidance \u2013 but we don\u2019t expect the launch of a new asset purchase programme given the lack of consensus among ECB members Markets will likely be disappointed, which would give investors an opportunity to take advantage of tensions in interest rates and spreads During its 25 July meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) validated the approach President Mario Draghi outlined in Sintra, Portugal, a month earlier: the ECB stands ready to take all necessary measures to preserve growth and move closer to its inflation target of 2%. The ECB\u2019s teams were then given a mandate to examine all monetary-stimulus options, including restarting its bond-buying programme. Since then, the political and economic environment has deteriorated: The euro zone \u2013 particularly Germany \u2013 is in a confirmed macroeconomic slowdown. Euro-zone inflation remains anaemic, with consumer price inflation (CPI) at 1% and core CPI at 0.9% in August. Political and geopolitical risks have escalated, with growing trade tensions between the United States and China and an increasingly tangible risk of a hard Brexit. Inflation expectations are again close to their lowest levels, with the 5-year/5-year forward swap at 1.20% on 4 September. This measurement of medium-term inflation expectations indicates that the markets are doubtful about the ECB's ability to push inflation higher. The US Federal Reserve lowered its rates in July. As a result, we expect the ECB to announce more concrete monetary-stimulus measures on 12 September. These include a 10-basis-point drop in the deposit rate (a basis point is 1/100 of a percentage point); the introduction of a multi-tier deposit facility (which would tax banks' excess reserves above a threshold that is specific to each institution); and stronger forward guidance, with an explicit commitment that key rates will remain low for a long time. However, we think it is unlikely that the ECB will announce the relaunch of its bond-buying programme at this stage. Recent comments from central-bank members indicate that there is no consensus about whether a new round of quantitative easing (QE) is desirable, even if the option remains on the table. In addition, the ECB probably wants to keep some room to manoeuvre to deal with a more pronounced deterioration in the economic and political environment \u2013 and to make a helpful tool available to its next president. Finally, the ECB may be seeking to regain some freedom from the markets, whose expectations are so high that they risk holding central banks hostage. Given that the markets are anticipating a larger stimulus package \u2013 expecting an 80% probability of a 20-basis-point rate cut and news of the restart of QE \u2013 they might be disappointed. For investors, this may provide an opportunity to take advantage of possible rate and spread tension to buy on dips \u2013 in particular by reinforcing duration on sovereign bonds and increasing credit exposure. 946745 Want to view more?

        "content": " Active is: Anticipating what\u2019s ahead A major about-turn for the Fed by Franck Dixmier | 25/07/2019 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary In the face of slowing global economic growth, continued trade tensions and the prospect of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, the FOMC seems set to announce a reduction in interest rates at its next meeting. We expect a 50-basis-point cut that will start a new rate-cut cycle, and we think the markets should react favourably. Key takeaways The FOMC meeting on 30-31 July seems likely to mark a major turning point in monetary policy for the Fed The Fed appears set to enter a rate-cut cycle; we expect the FOMC to announce a decrease of 50 basis points Given a weakening global economy and persistent trade tensions, the Fed likely wishes to act pre-emptively as an exercise in risk management Markets might be surprised at the news, but will likely react positively given the historically favourable impact of rate cuts on equity markets It now seems likely that the US Federal Reserve will initiate a rate-cut cycle at the 30-31 July meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Paving the way for this decision were a range of recent announcements from FOMC members \u2013 including statements by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida and New York Fed President John Williams \u2013 as well as the minutes of the last FOMC meeting. US economic data such as job creation, retail sales, production and inflation rose surprisingly in June, and they show an economy that is still robust. However, the Fed no longer seems to base its policy-making on data. It appears to be focusing instead on slowing global economic growth, which leads to diminishing demand, and on the high-risk environment stemming from trade tensions and the prospect of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d. The Fed\u2019s likely decision to lower rates would therefore appear to be based on its approach to risk management: if doing less appears riskier than doing more, then the Fed feels justified to do more now than would otherwise seem necessary. Market expectations of a 50-basis-point rate cut as early as July have been quite volatile, recently dropping from 40% to a lower level, according to fed funds futures. However, we believe that the Fed\u2019s risk-management policy justifies a 50-bp reduction. There are two arguments for this: Today\u2019s interest-rate level, which is near the \u201czero lower bound\u201d, encourages the Fed to take voluntary action to maximise its effectiveness. Given the delay in transmitting a rate cut to the real economy \u2013 transmission takes between six and 12 months \u2013 the Fed may feel it has no time to lose and could want an insurance policy. It should also be noted that the Fed is experiencing pressure from two fronts. President Donald Trump and the markets want a rate cut, and the Fed is also feeling pressure to address the US dollar \u2013 which some economists estimate is overvalued by around 10%. Despite what central bankers say, maintaining a desired exchange rate seems to have become an unacknowledged objective. If the Fed decides to cut rates, the markets might be surprised but should react favourably. We think a 50-bp cut will lead to a \u201cbull-steepening\u201d phenomenon, a compression of spreads, a lower dollar and the continuation of a dynamic that is beneficial for the equity markets. 909943 Want to view more?

Key takeaways We except the ECB to announce concrete monetary-stimulus measures at its 12 September meeting, in line with the comments it made in July Among the likely announcements are a rate cut, a new multi-tier deposit facility for banks and enhanced forward guidance \u2013 but we don\u2019t expect the launch of a new asset purchase programme given the lack of consensus among ECB members Markets will likely be disappointed, which would give investors an opportunity to take advantage of tensions in interest rates and spreads Load More "

Some see a fresh start in the arrival of a new prime minister eager to change the narrative. But it\u2019s difficult at this stage to look beyond Brexit to make a convincing short-term investment case for UK assets, despite a number of enduring positive fundamentals. Key takeaways It\u2019s tempting to see the Boris Johnson premiership as a fresh start for the UK \u2013 but Brexit-related uncertainty remains a major obstacle for investors While the UK boasts some positive fundamental qualities, it\u2019s difficult to see beyond Brexit in the short term Any future reassessment of the UK relies on Mr Johnson doing two things: achieving a satisfactory Brexit resolution and creating a compelling, forward-looking and positive narrative This week, the UK announced its new prime minister. Boris Johnson stepped into Downing Street as the new Conservative Party leader and replacement for Theresa May, whose premiership foundered on her failure to deliver Brexit. Meanwhile, the UK markets remain in the doldrums even though the economy has been surprisingly resilient and stocks of internationally focused UK companies have done relatively well, at least in sterling terms. Indeed, the \u201cvaluation gap\u201d between internationally focused stocks and their more domestic counterparts is among the most extreme in recent times. We are not surprised investors have been underweight the UK; it is a difficult market to navigate. Not only is overall sentiment pessimistic, but UK equity and bond markets are pointing in different directions. Brexit is, of course, a large part of the reason why the UK is struggling, and Mr Johnson takes office with the clock ticking on a 31 October deadline \u2013 the end date for the current Brexit extension granted by the European Union. In the face of this major challenge, the new prime minister will be eager to change the narrative and inject optimism. Yet we think that any positive rhetoric from Mr Johnson will be insufficient for changing investors\u2019 view of the UK fundamentally. He must first resolve Brexit \u2013 and until he does, it will always get in the way. The first important days One of the challenges facing the incoming prime minister is that his party holds only a small majority in the UK parliament. Unless and until Mr Johnson calls a general election, and his Conservative Party gain a sizeable majority, the parliamentary maths remain forbidding \u2013 on Brexit and any other issues that require primary legislation. That doesn\u2019t give him much support for a radical new fiscal programme. Nor would Mr Johnson have much room for manoeuvre if he were to find the votes: the current-account budget deficit may be down, but the UK faces a late-cycle environment with a mountain of debt. So what can the new prime minister do from a fiscal perspective to set the tone for his premiership while positioning his government \u2013 and the country at large \u2013 for an uncertain Brexit outcome or even a general election? In his first speech as prime minister, Mr Johnson said that those people \u201cwho bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts\u201d and spoke of an economic package in the autumn to boost the country\u2019s competitiveness. Given his lack of a meaningful parliamentary majority, he may need to focus initially on measures that require no primary legislation. These could include housing-market stimulus such as a reduction in stamp duty, cuts to value-added tax (VAT) or a vehicle-scrappage scheme that encourages use of more environmentally friendly cars. Short-term stimulus aside, there is no avoiding the Brexit question. We\u2019re not going to speculate on the likely outcome, but the new prime minister has been bullish on Brexit, even if that means a hard, no-deal departure. At the same time, he will be cognisant of the existential threat posed by the Brexit Party, which made major inroads into the Conservative vote in the European elections with its uncompromising approach to Brexit. What this means for investors From our perspective, a lot of \u201cifs\u201d remain. If Mr Johnson is able to pull off a satisfactory resolution to Brexit \u2013 no mean feat \u2013 and if he creates a compelling, positive narrative, we could see a reassessment of the UK\u2019s prospects: The British pound sterling has struggled since the Brexit referendum in 2016, and we continue to be nervous about the currency in the short term \u2013 despite it being undervalued on just about every measure. Sterling would be among the first beneficiaries of an improved outlook for the UK. The UK may turn out to be the value trade it has promised to be. For example, real estate and utilities have been discounted, in part because of Brexit-induced economic and political uncertainty. A positive resolution of Brexit that reduces near-term economic and political risks could mean a move upward as these risks are priced out. From an environmental, social and governance (ESG) perspective, the UK has some of the highest corporate governance and stewardship standards. We believe this may become more important over time as ESG risks come to play a greater role in separating the long-term winners from the losers. The UK economy has many long-term attractions, such as a well-educated workforce, a commitment to liberal values and the protection of property rights. In a world where markets are driven by energy and conviction, a shift in direction could be the boost people need to look past the negative noise and see the positive fundamentals. Still, despite Mr Johnson\u2019s victory, nothing significant has changed overnight, and it may be too soon for investors who are underweight the UK to take a new tack. 908802 Want to view more?

We expect a 50-basis-point cut that will start a new rate-cut cycle, and we think the markets should react favourably. Key takeaways The FOMC meeting on 30-31 July seems likely to mark a major turning point in monetary policy for the Fed The Fed appears set to enter a rate-cut cycle; we expect the FOMC to announce a decrease of 50 basis points Given a weakening global economy and persistent trade tensions, the Fed likely wishes to act pre-emptively as an exercise in risk management Markets might be surprised at the news, but will likely react positively given the historically favourable impact of rate cuts on equity markets Load More "

This has historically meant positive returns for equities, but we still favour a defensive position across risk markets. Key takeaways The Fed is likely to commence an easing cycle in the second half of 2019; the FOMC has indicated that its next move will be a rate cut US growth is decelerating, but we do not see an imminent recession over the next six months, so Fed easing would be what an \u201cinsurance\u201d cycle Historically, equities and fixed income have both performed well during insurance cycles Despite insurance easing cycles historically resulting in positive returns, we still favour defensive positioning across risk markets The Fed\u2019s next move will be policy easing At the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC\u2019s) June meeting, Fed chair Jerome Powell and team delivered a dovish message that exceeded market expectations, signalling that the Fed is ready and willing to step in with policy easing \u201cas appropriate.\u201d Several updates to its statement, economic projections and press conference suggest the Fed\u2019s next move will be a rate cut. In particular: The FOMC statement dispensed with its previous \u201cpatient\u201d language, while economic activity was recategorised as \u201cmoderate\u201d and uncertainties about the global outlook \u201cincreased.\u201d The FOMC\u2019s updated median \u201cdot plot\u201d showed a rate cut for 2020, instead of the rate hike it showed at the last meeting (Exhibit 1). Notably, seven of the 17 FOMC members projected 50 basis points of easing this year. Powell indicated clearly in the press conference that he \u201cwill act as appropriate\u201d in terms of the Fed\u2019s rate path, noting \u201cmany participants now see the case for somewhat more accommodative policy.\u201d Exhibit 1: Fed dot plot vs. market expectation Source: Bloomberg, July 2019 Our base case now calls for a 25 basis point rate cut in both September and December. We believe a Fed easing cycle is likely to commence in the second half of 2019. We could see a rate cut as early as July \u2013 despite a solid jobs report this month \u2013 if the Fed chooses to undertake insurance cuts, particularly in light of rising levels of negative-yielding debt globally and the ongoing inversion of the US yield curve.1 Additionally, while we see the Fed most likely moving in 25 basis point increments, a 50 basis point rate cut during this cycle is not out of the question, depending on whether data deteriorate swiftly. Not all easing cycles are created equal: \u201cinsurance\u201d vs. \u201cpre-recession\u201d easing What would a Fed easing cycle mean for risk assets broadly? We observed data around the past eight Fed rate-cutting cycles \u2013 from 1981 to 2007\u2013 and highlight several key takeaways. Two types of Fed easing cycles We categorise Fed easing cycles into two broad groups: insurance cycles or pre-recession cycles. Insurance cycles are those where the Fed eases while the economy is not in a recession, but economic headwinds loom. Pre-recession cycles are when the Fed eases as the economy is entering \u2013 or already in \u2013 a recession. Of the last eight easing cycles since 1981, the split between insurance and pre-recession cycles was even, with four in each camp (Exhibit 2). Exhibit 2: Insurance and pre-recession Fed easing cycles since 1981 Fed Funds target rate % Start End Days Start End Change Type of cut 6/1/1981 12/15/1982 562 20.00 8.50 -11.50 Pre-recession 10/2/1984 8/19/1986 686 11.75 5.88 -5.88 Insurance 10/19/1987 2/10/1988 114 7.25 6.50 -0.75 Insurance 6/5/1989 9/4/1992 1187 9.75 3.00 -6.75 Pre-recession 7/6/1995 1/31/1996 209 6.00 5.25 -0.75 Insurance 9/29/1998 11/17/1998 49 5.50 4.75 -0.75 Insurance 1/3/2001 6/25/2003 903 6.50 1.00 -5.50 Pre-recession 9/18/2007 12/16/2008 455 5.25 0.25 -5.00 Pre-recession Average 521 -4.61 Source: Allianz Global Investors Global Economics & Strategy, June 2019. Risk returns in insurance vs. pre-recession cycles Historically, market performance has varied significantly between insurance and pre-recession cycles. One year into an easing cycle, the S&P 500 generated a 20.4% average return during insurance cycles compared with a -10.2% average return during pre-recession cycles (Exhibit 3). This divergence suggests that where we are in the US economic cycle may dictate how risk assets respond to the next round of Fed easing. Exhibit 3: S&P 500 performance one year before and after initial rate cut Source: Factset, June 2019. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.It is not possible to invest directly in an index. The reason for this divergence between easing cycles lies primarily with equities: the US, global and emerging market equities all performed substantially better in insurance cycles than in pre-recession cycles (Exhibit 4). Certain asset classes performed similarly regardless of cycle type. Fixed-income assets generally performed well in both insurance and pre-recession cycles, while real assets, such as gold and commodities, tended to underperform regardless of the cycle type. Exhibit 4: Excess return vs cash during Fed rate cut cycles Source: Allianz Global Investors Global Economics & Strategy, Bloomberg, Datastream, June 2019 From a sector perspective, we find that cyclical sectors \u2013 such as technology, industrials and consumer discretionary \u2013 tend to perform well in insurance cycles, while more defensive areas like healthcare and consumer staples lag. The reverse is generally true during pre-recession easing cycles: cyclical sectors tend to underperform, although we also see more defensive sectors like utilities lag materially (Exhibit 5).

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.It is not possible to invest directly in an index. An \u201cinsurance\u201d Fed easing cycle could be likely this time The US economy \u2013 alongside the global economy \u2013 is certainly decelerating, but growth isn\u2019t expected to turn negative. While we believe fragility in the economy has increased, and tail risks from areas like trade and geopolitics remain, we do not yet see an imminent recession risk over the next six months, when the Fed is expected to begin its easing cycle. Real growth forecasts in the US are expected to slow \u2013 from 3% in 2018 to just above 2% this year, and to below 2% in 2020. Indicators such as manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs) and OECD leading indicators are also weakening, while the S&P 500\u2019s earnings growth is likely to slow to the low single-digits this year, down from 20% last year. However, we continue to see one key area of overall strength in the economy: the US consumer, which is critical, considering domestic consumption comprises nearly 70% of US GDP. Unemployment remains at near historic lows, at 3.7%, while consumer confidence remains near its multi-year high, despite recent volatility. We have also seen a recent rising trend in consumer spending, particularly among discretionary categories; lower rates may also provide support to critical areas like housing and auto sales. The recent tariff truce between President Trump and China\u2019s President Xi at the G20 meeting in Japan was incrementally positive, particularly for the US consumer, as both sides agreed to resume trade discussions \u201con the basis of equality and mutual respect.\u201d Importantly, the US also decided to postpone tariffs indefinitely on the final USD 300 billion of Chinese imports, which mainly targeted consumer goods, such as textiles, apparel and footwear. While global trade tensions continue to remain an overhang, the immediate threat of another round of consumer-focused tariffs is off the table for now. The 1990s case study: similarities to today As the Fed likely embarks on rate cuts later this year, we see somewhat similar economic conditions to those that previously resulted in two insurance easing cycles during the 1990s. In 1995, the Fed trimmed rates as an insurance measure when inflationary pressures eased; inflation (core CPI) fell from 5% the previous year to the 2%\u20133% range, while unemployment fell from 5.6% to 4.0%. Today, the US economy has a similar inflationary and unemployment profile, with core CPI stagnating in the 2% range and unemployment falling to multi-decade lows. In 1998, the Fed enacted another insurance cut on the economy, reducing rates pre-emptively to cushion the effects of an external shock \u2013 namely the Asian financial crisis \u2013 which could have potentially hindered US growth. Today, concerns about worsening US-China trade relations and escalating tariffs could be considered a similar external threat, acting as a potential catalyst for a slowdown; the Fed could respond to these potential shocks with insurance cuts. Portfolio positioning: remain defensive and up-in-quality While the Fed may be embarking on the start of an insurance easing cycle, which has historically been favourable for risk assets, it is worth noting that market returns in the first half of the year were already remarkably strong \u2013 with the S&P 500 up nearly 18%. Given that insurance easing cycles historically result in positive returns, we believe active exposure is still necessary, with a focus on defensive and up-in-quality assets across risk markets. We continue to favour a barbell approach in both domestic and global equities. In the US, we like select cyclical sectors that have done well historically in insurance easing cycles, including areas of technology with secular growth themes, such as mobile payments, cloud, and cybersecurity. On the other side of the barbell, we favour more defensive sectors like aerospace/defence, REITs2 and staples, which have all lagged technology this year but tend to perform well in a decelerating growth environment. Globally, we continue to prefer US equities from a developed market perspective, and also favour select Asian and emerging market equities. In fixed income, we continue to prefer an \u201cup-in-quality\u201d positioning in both US investment grade and high yield. Given the ongoing \u201chunt for income\u201d that investors face in today\u2019s low-rate environment, we also see select opportunities in European and Asian high yield, especially for US-dollar-denominated investors. In addition, we continue to favour convertible bonds, which also offer the potential for equity upside. We remain overweight alternatives, both liquid and illiquid, which tend to be less correlated to both equities and fixed income, providing an appealing source of diversification. We believe areas like absolute return and long/short strategies, as well as private credit or infrastructure debt and equity, remain favourable at this stage of the cycle. 1) Source: Bloomberg, July 2019.

What should be the priorities for the incoming administration? Key takeaways There has been limited progress made in resolving Europe\u2019s old challenges, and new ones have emerged, including how to respond competitively to large US corporate disruptors Nevertheless, Europe has tremendous inherent strengths, notably across the energy, industrial and consumer services sectors The EU should avoid the US model of \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d by reinvigorating its scientific and engineering skills to \u201cmove slow and make things\u201d Europe can offer an alternative model, which values individual freedom, tolerance, open trade and political and social freedom European Union (EU) President Jean-Claude Juncker leaves his post in October, after five years in the role. At the start of his term, we wrote about Mr Juncker\u2019s key priorities in his first 100 days, encouraging him to be bold on political, economic and social issues. Five years later\u2026 well, not much has been done to address the malaises that afflict the world\u2019s largest trading bloc. There has been little boldness over the past half-decade. Much, of course, has changed in those five years, not least Brexit and the rise of right-wing populist movements and governments, which threaten the cohesiveness of the EU and reflects new fundamental fault lines that have been opening up in the past decade. Box 1 outlines the challenges highlighted five years ago and how each area has developed during Mr Juncker\u2019s term. While the EU President\u2019s scorecard shows little success or progress, it is worth re-addressing the challenges that Europe now faces and offering another \u201cManifesto for Europe\u201d to the incoming president. Box 1: Challenges facing the incoming EU President in 2014 in 2019 POLITICAL EU austerity against Italy and its banks Unchanged, Italy still weak and struggling Tension with the UK to avoid Brexit Brexit - and a no-deal - may happen this year Rising tensions with the US over spying Russia, US tech firm regulation and taxation, and threats to NATO loom ECONOMIC EU growth dependent on global demand EU slowing as China stalls and trade wars grow Brussel\u2019s bureaucracy to deliver a new EU vision Muddling through still seems likely SOCIAL Youth unemployment nearing a social crisis A lost generation is now emerging Ageing and immigration causing social concerns Rising immigration contributing to political fragmentation FINANCIAL ECB policy has weakened the euro Further weakness may anger the US ECB QE has not solved the banking doom loop Banks remain a weak link for investors Zero interest rates have not boosted activity In Germany, negative rates have actually seen an increase in saving, not spending The evolution over the past few years has produced many new challenges: Europe\u2019s divided approach to investment and taxation has seen both internal competition and a failure to compete collectively with the US and China. Strong cultural and regional differences have meant Europe has been unable to respond competitively to large US corporate disruptors, except through regulation such as GDPR. Europe has also struggled to make the most of its innovation. A lack of entrepreneurial flair and risk-taking venture capital has seen young European talent relocate to the US, where start-up failures are more tolerated and risk capital is easier to access. Regulation in Europe has often stymied home-grown innovation and invention, even though many European corporates are in fact global leaders in their industries. Established corporates have been hindered as structural and industry reforms have been repressed, such that the EU has not benefited from the economies of scale of its US and Chinese competitors. Capital markets are fragmented and unsympathetically regulated, raising capital costs and lessening potential returns. Further, political and policy uncertainty undermines corporate and investor confidence, as market-based solutions are often ignored. So, as Europe faces a world that may soon encompass Brexit and widening trade tension between the EU, the US and China \u2013 as well as growing political strains centred around Iran, Russia, Ukraine, NATO, Nordstream II and climate change, the next EU President faces an even more complex yet pressing array of challenges. Today, five years on from our first, we offer a second \u201cManifesto for Europe\u201d, which may help the new president prioritise and focus on the key challenges over the next five years. Europe has tremendous inherent strengths, particularly across the energy, industrial and consumer service sectors, which can offer global solutions to pollution, energy efficiency and climate change, creating an Industriewende 4.0 (\u201cindustrial shift\u201d) and a second Wirtschaftswunder (\u201ceconomic miracle\u201d). This will dovetail well with heightened environmental awareness, as indicated by the increased Green party vote in the recent EU elections. Europe should continue to avoid the US model of \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d, instead reinvigorating its scientific and engineering skills to \u201cmove slow and make things\u201d. It could increase and incentivise more research and development into sustainable real-world and future-world solutions, such as hydrogen power, nuclear fusion and low-carbon and biodegradable plastics. The EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 programme is already ploughing more than \u20ac24bn into research, technology, infrastructure, and higher education. Europe must return to the importance of education and youth engagement so that the generation most impacted by the recent crisis is not lost from making an economic contribution in the future. This should also ensure that academic mobility and access to opportunity increase. Taken as a whole, Europe has strong sovereign balance sheets and good savings ratios, which can be put to better use addressing the challenges of ageing demographics, the affordability of welfare and healthcare, and tensions around immigration into the EU from Africa and the Middle East, which is likely to continue to grow as desertification around the Sahara continues. Europe needs its leaders to see it as a single market \u2013 which recent M&A (mergers & aquisitions) refusals suggest is not currently the case \u2013 as its larger, more global competitors will offer greater scale and resources in the future. In addition, Europe should be encouraging the greater efficiency of its broad corporate environment, as it will deliver a payback of more investment, better services and lower prices to consumers, as well as a more competitive and productive economy. Europe can continue to take the lead in creating and regulating a digital single market, which will be increasingly demanded by its millennials (those born between 1981 \u20131986) and centennials (born between 1997 \u2013 2017). This should ease the pressure to develop rivals to the US\u2019s tech giants, but prioritising the creation of wealth and economic benefit to European standards, unlike the profiteering US equivalents. Europe has the size and opportunity to stand against the growing friction between the US and China by offering a third way to other nations who value individual freedom, tolerance, open trade and political and social freedom, underpinned by a fair social contract to protect the weak and ill. Such a manifesto has the potential to align and unite those many Europeans concerned by rising political tensions. It could create the momentum needed to conclude the last essential steps on the way to the \u201cUnited States of Europe\u201d.

        "content": " Active is: Adapting to shifts in global trade Do US-China trade tensions signal an end to globalisation? by Neil Dwane | 25/06/2019 Summary It looks increasingly unlikely that the US and China will reach an amicable agreement to end their ongoing trade conflict. If tensions between the two countries continue to escalate, we could witness the end of a decades-long period of globalisation \u2013 with several major implications for investors. Key takeaways It seems there are good reasons for the leaders of both the US and China to avoid backing down in their ongoing trade dispute Higher US tariffs on imports may drive up inflation, which might compel the Fed to hike rates, boosting the US dollar but hitting US growth expectations and emerging-market assets The use of the dollar as an economic weapon may see the currency strengthen in the short term; this could undermine its appeal as the world\u2019s reserve currency over a longer horizon China might retaliate with a \u201cdon\u2019t buy America\u201d policy, hitting US corporate profits for decades to come, and by denying US companies access to critical China-based supply chains Countries around the globe are likely to come under pressure to choose sides in the dispute, resulting in an increasingly polarised world We\u2019ve written extensively about the \u201ctech cold war\u201d that has developed between the US and China in the past year. We think it\u2019s likely to have some wider consequences for the global economy over the coming years, possibly creating two rival tech ecosystems. While there could be upside for some sectors \u2013 such as defence and cyber-security \u2013 major disruption may ensue for many of the world\u2019s largest tech and consumer company supply chains. Like many, we expected that the more basic trade war between the US and China would be resolved by China agreeing to buy more from the US and being less aggressive in its acquisition of intellectual property (IP) and technology. Neither country would benefit from a full-blown trade war. But now we need to consider why negotiations have so far failed and what might come next. There is little reason to think that either side will back down. In the run-up to the November 2020 presidential elections, it\u2019s clear that President Trump views the US-China trade relationship as a political opportunity at home; he considers a firm stance \u2013 against China as well as other countries \u2013 as an effective way of appealing to his voters and differentiating himself from his Democratic rivals. Despite the apparent power that President Xi holds, it may be that he is simply unable to meet US demands regarding the legal implementation of patents and IP. Or he may face strong domestic pressure to discontinue current negotiations with the US \u2013 despite the threat of economic war. For its part, the Chinese Communist Party will be reluctant to lose face in a year when it celebrates seven decades in government. President Xi may be keen to \u201cpretend and extend\u201d negotiations with the US in the hope of a change of US president. If there\u2019s no deal...? Any failure to reach a trade agreement could have a significant impact on the global economy into 2020 \u2013 so, what ramifications can investors expect? Pain for US consumers \u2013 Given that the US economy is 70% consumption-based, the country\u2019s consumers will be sensitive to rising import prices, in the event that the US increases or extends tariffs. The US Federal Reserve will be vigilant on US domestic inflation, although analysis suggests that inflation linked to trade war is transitory. A defensive, less dovish Fed may undermine hopes for rate cuts that would support growth, lessen the valuation support for US equities, and support the US dollar. This could also impact sentiment towards emerging markets and Asia. Tensions over US dollar funding \u2013 Taking advantage of the \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d of the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency, the US could be tempted to use this as an economic weapon. The US dollar might strengthen in the short term, impacting both emerging-market economies and US corporate profitability. Longer-term, this course of action could undermine its appeal as the world\u2019s reserve currency, and countries may accelerate plans to reduce exposure to the US dollar \u2013 at a time when the US is issuing large amounts of Treasuries to fund its deficits. Moreover, recent political tensions in Hong Kong and the rising criticism of the treatment of the Uighur Muslims could also cause further financial friction, potentially jeopardising the US Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 \u2013 which allows the US to treat Hong Kong separately from China in trade matters. Pressure to choose sides \u2013 Trade conflict could see both the US and China exert influence on their trading partners and allies, forcing them to take sides and increasing global tensions in the process. A recent flashpoint has been the arrest in Canada of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, who has fought extradition to the US. Additionally, the US has exerted pressure across Europe. The swift, critical response from President Trump to the recent dovish comments by European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi may inflame tensions, not only across the auto and agricultural sectors but also towards the euro and ECB policies. This potentially widens the gap between historic allies and further undermines NATO. \u201cDon\u2019t buy America\u201d \u2013 For its part, China may enact a \u201cdon\u2019t buy America\u201d campaign, which could seriously affect US corporations operating in the country and related markets, not just in the short term but for decades to come. China implemented similar \u2013 and highly effective \u2013 campaigns against Japanese and South Korean companies in 2013 in 2015 respectively, with serious implications for their Chinese operations. Such a policy could affect US companies\u2019 earnings and ultimately hit the S&P 500 index, especially given that its biggest sector \u2013 technology \u2013 is highly exposed to China, as an important end-market and as an intrinsic part of the US tech sector\u2019s low-cost supply chain. Furthermore, the US services surplus with China of around USD 50 billion could be vulnerable, since the role of US companies in China\u2019s banking, insurance and asset management industries is likely to be challenged. Denial of access to critical supply chains \u2013 China may retaliate by denying access to certain key areas of industrial and technology value chains, where it holds a dominant position as a supplier. This could severely disrupt the global supply chains of many industries, resulting in higher production costs and even preventing the production of some goods. One example is rare-earth metals, which are vital raw materials in almost all high-tech products \u2013 from mobile phones and computers to military and scientific equipment. With few alternative suppliers, and limited scope to stockpile, this arguably shows up the West\u2019s short-term attitude and lack of strategic planning. Repatriation of Chinese companies \u2013 China is keen to diversify and deepen its financial markets, broadening their appeal to domestic and foreign investors. This may be an incentive for Chinese companies currently listed in the US to return home to Shanghai or Hong Kong. US investors would become forced sellers and would be denied access to some of the fastest-growing companies in Asia. In another twist, US senator Marco Rubio has written to index provider MSCI expressing concern over the inclusion of Chinese stocks in its emerging-market index. Mr Rubio argues that this may expose US investors to companies with poor corporate governance. His letter is part of a wider campaign to crack down on Chinese companies operating in US equity markets, which could accelerate their return to domestic exchanges. Fewer buyers of US Treasuries \u2013 China is likely to continue to press on with its strategic policy of internationalising the renminbi, reducing its need for US dollar balances. Combined with geopolitical tensions elsewhere, the US may find there are few US bond investors to hold its booming US Treasuries issuance. China is unlikely to sell its existing US Treasury holdings as there is no other market deep or liquid enough in which to invest the proceeds. China to become a better diplomatic partner \u2013 China continues to advance its Belt and Road Initiative, offering strategic investment and market access to many emerging-market and other countries that are otherwise struggling to find growth and investment in this sluggish global economy. By filling a void left by the retreating and increasingly isolationist US, China is offering an alternative diplomatic route forward while increasing its presence and geopolitical status. Geopolitics \u2013 a key risk factor After a sustained period of globalisation, we are now seeing the world\u2019s two largest economies seeking to internalise more of their economic growth. They are also looking to bring other countries within their economic and political orbits. These trends could be highly disruptive to the multinational corporates that have prospered during a long period of relative international harmony, when the opening up of markets has allowed them to attract new customers around the world. Geopolitics may play a greater role in investor decision-making from now on, as US-China trade tensions highlight visible differences in policy towards countries such as Iran, Taiwan and Venezuela. Such inconsistencies were sustainable in a growing, globalising world but will become harder to accept in a more competitive, polarised environment. Even key trading hubs like Hong Kong and Singapore might find that they are no longer able to appease both sides. With those far-reaching implications in mind, we hope the G20 in Japan at the end of June will provide a platform for a reset in relations between the US and China and an agreement to start \u201ctalks about talks\u201d. 884065 Want to view more?

Given the increased uncertainty about the second half of the year, investors should stay active, defensive and diversified. Key takeaways In recent weeks, the US-China trade relationship has notably deteriorated, and US consumers are in the crosshairs; tariffs may be a long-term theme There are still pockets of bright spots in the US \u2013 notably a resilient US consumer, low rates and low inflation \u2013 but we see growing downside risks to economic growth We expect to see positive returns for the year, but we don\u2019t expect the pace of the first four months to continue In both equities and fixed income, we suggest moving up in quality, favouring more defensive investments with stronger balance sheets and free-cash-flow metrics After a strong start to the year, US-China trade wars hit the markets On the heels of a near-20% decline in the S&P 500 Index at the end of 2018, the first four months of this year were met with market optimism. Investors took the opportunity to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d amid an improving outlook on multiple fronts \u2013 in particular, the Federal Reserve\u2019s pause in short-term rate hikes. Many global risk assets showed strong returns in early 2019 Year-to-date total returns at the end of April Source: FactSet. Data as at 30 April 2019. But market performance and sentiment took a negative turn in early May, following escalating trade tensions between the US and China. President Donald Trump announced that the existing tariffs on USD 200 billion of Chinese goods would escalate from 10% to 25%, and the remaining USD 300 billion of Chinese imports not currently hit with tariffs could experience a 25% levy in the coming months. Since this shift, the US-China trade relationship has notably deteriorated, with China indicating it is prepared for a long road ahead \u2013 and perhaps willing to start negotiations over again. A few key points are worth highlighting: US consumers are in the crosshairs. So far, consumer products have accounted for only 22% of the Chinese goods targeted by tariffs, but 60% of products targeted in the next wave of tariffs might be consumer goods. US consumers could feel an outsize impact, which may hurt confidence and potential growth. China only imports USD 125 billion of US goods, so they cannot retaliate in kind. Instead, China may utilize \u201cnon-tariff barriers\u201d \u2013 including limiting US investments, adding additional regulatory hurdles, banning US products or brands, and ratcheting up geopolitical pressure where possible (eg, North Korea and Iran). Tariffs could be a long-term theme. Even if a trade deal is reached, the overhang of tariffs will likely remain \u2013 both as an enforcement mechanism and as part of President Trump\u2019s trade strategy. In addition, given the recent hardening of rhetoric from China, the possibility of the US and China not reaching a deal has increased, in our view. Trade war with Mexico averted \u2013 for now In late May, President Trump threatened tariffs on Mexico, which could have escalated up to a 25% levy on all Mexican imports if the country didn\u2019t comply with Mr Trump\u2019s demands to enhance border security. But by early June, the US and Mexico reached an agreement, avoiding a major trade dispute. Why did Mexico react so swiftly to the threat of tariffs? Relative to its economy, the US is a dominant trading partner, accounting for nearly 80% of all Mexican exports \u2013 or about 30% of its total GDP. By comparison, the US only accounts for 19% of Chinese exports, or 4% of its GDP. Mexico clearly had a bigger incentive than China to avoid tariffs with its largest trading partner. Although the US seems to have achieved its goals in getting Mexico to enact changes, there may be repercussions for using tariffs to address non-trade issues. Mexico is a vital trading partner for the US, and this relationship has been strained. The potential passage of the new, post-NAFTA United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has also grown less certain. In addition, China may be less inclined to strike a deal if it believes the US will implement new tariffs down the road based on non-trade-related policies. Our outlook for growth and leading economic indicators If trade tensions escalate into a full-blown trade war, we see a downside to US and global real GDP growth. According to Bloomberg, an escalating trade war could shave 0.7 percentage points off of US GDP and 0.9 percentage points from China\u2019s GDP, lowering global growth by 0.6 percentage points over the next two years. Given the trajectory of decelerating growth in the US, there is a growing risk that a trade shock could tip the economy into a downturn. While there are still pockets of bright spots in the US \u2013 notably a resilient US consumer supported by relatively low rates and low inflation \u2013 we see growing downside risks to economic growth, particularly if tariffs hurt consumer-goods pricing. Globally, we\u2019ve seen substantial drops in key indicators such as purchasing managers index (PMI) data, which show economic trends in manufacturing. Together with declines in OECD leading indicators, this suggests potential softness in the global economy. Our view on the second half is getting murkier While the markets began the year with growing optimism for a second-half recovery, tensions between the US, China and Mexico have created concern \u2013 as has the decelerating momentum in leading economic indicators such as PMIs. In the US, we think earnings expectations remain relatively elevated for the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. Consensus estimates call for a 7% year-over-year growth in S&P earnings. But if the US dollar continues to strengthen, US exporters could feel more pressure \u2013 a de-facto additional tariff as US companies try to sell their goods and services abroad. With the growth outlook now deteriorating, markets have priced in two or three Fed rate cuts by year-end. In our view, the possibility of a rate cut has grown more likely to become reality given the potential for slowing economic fundamentals. However, we think the Fed will continue to be patient and data-dependent, and it won\u2019t act unless data or expectations have meaningfully changed. Overall, while we expect to see positive returns for the year, we don\u2019t expect the pace of the first four months to continue. Geopolitical shifts could also increase volatility. A mixed outlook for the remainder of 2019 Indicator 2017 2018 2019 expectation US equities (S&P 500) +19% -6.2% High single-digit to low double-digit US rates (10-year yield %) 2.41 (2.04 - 2.63 range) 2.68 (2.41 - 3.24 range) 2.25 - 2.75 US real GDP growth 2.2% 2.9% 2.4% (lower in full trade war) US inflation (core PCE) 1.6% 2.0% 2.0% - 2.2% Fed rate hikes 3 hikes 4 hikes 0 hikes (data dependent, rate cut probability higher) Volatility All-time lows Increases in spurts Increases in spurts Source: Allianz Global Investors. Data as at May 2019. Strategies for positioning portfolios Given the increased uncertainty in the second half of this year, we advise investors to stay active, defensive and diversified. In both equities and fixed income, we suggest moving up in quality, favouring more defensive investments with stronger balance sheets and free-cash-flow metrics. In equities, consider a \u201cbarbell\u201d approach: on one end could be tech firms specialising in mobile payments, cloud computing and cyber-security; on the other, defensive sectors such as health care, staples and defence/military positions. In terms of regions, we remain neutral on China, but favour parts of Asia that may benefit from supply chain disruptions (Thailand and Vietnam) or that recently completed positive election cycles (India and Indonesia). We are cautious on Europe, which has seen deteriorating growth and is more exposed to global trade declines. In fixed income, we are neutral on duration and favour higher-quality US investment-grade and high-yield issues. Parts of the securitised fixed-income segment could complement corporate bonds. We also see pockets of value in areas like European and Asian high yield. Additional alpha potential may be found in investments focused on ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues, infrastructure debt/equity strategies and absolute-return strategies. These asset classes could benefit as we head into the second half of 2019 and position for a maturing economic cycle. Further reading For a deeper dive into our global view, read: In our mid-year outlook, trade and politics are top challenges Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. Equities have tended to be volatile, and do not offer a fixed rate of return. Bond prices will normally decline as interest rates rise. The impact may be greater with longer-duration bonds. Foreign markets may be more volatile, less liquid, less transparent, and subject to less oversight, and values may fluctuate with currency exchange rates; these risks may be greater in emerging markets.

        "content": " Active is: Anticipating what\u2019s ahead Balancing exercise mandatory for the Fed by Franck Dixmier | 17/06/2019 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Markets are keenly awaiting the next monetary policy meeting of the US Federal Reserve, which will take place on 18 and 19 June. Key takeaways The Federal Open Market Committee meeting comes as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) is under constant pressure from the markets and the White House Even if the Fed's next move should be a rate cut, at this stage it seems unlikely that this decision will be announced as early as 19 June Market disappointment could lead to a rate correction, which should encourage investors to take longer duration exposure in their US bond portfolios The escalation of trade tensions between the United States and China has caused investors to fear a sharp slowdown in global growth; equity market volatility has risen again; while inflation expectations have continued to fall, with the 5-year/5-year inflation swap rate falling to 2.03% in early June - despite a slight rebound in core inflation in April - and the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures rising from 1.5% in March to 1.6% in April. As a result, markets are now anticipating just over three 0.25% or 25bps rate cuts over the next 12 months, including a little more than two by the end of the year. In addition, political pressure is increasing, as President Trump wants to maintain economic activity at all costs. Jerome Powell, the Fed President, will therefore have to engage in a balancing act: if the resilience of the US economy, which remains robust, does not provide him with an argument justifying a change in monetary policy, he should nevertheless indicate that the central bank is ready for a \u201cFed Put\u201d if necessary to offset the negative effects of trade tensions. This would prove it is listening to the message sent by the markets not to tighten financial conditions. In a speech delivered in Chicago on 4 June, Jerome Powell said he was closely monitoring the impact of the tensions and stood ready to act appropriately if necessary, thus opening the door to a rate cut without explicitly mentioning it. It now seems very likely to us that the Fed's next move will be a rate cut, not an increase. However, we believe that the Fed will not take a decision at the 19 June meeting. There are several reasons for this: The US economy is resilient, supported by household consumption, and the full employment target has been exceeded. The Fed needs more time and real data to adjust its forward guidance downwards, and this would need to include converging indicators confirming a real deterioration in activity. The normalisation of monetary policy was put on hold after nine rate hikes, with Fed Fund rates fluctuating between 2.25% and 2.50%, from historically low levels. The central bank's room for manoeuvre is therefore limited: rate cuts will be a scarce resource, the timing of which must be particularly well gauged in order to guarantee maximum efficiency. US Equity markets, despite volatility, are close to historical highs, and continue to experience one of the longest upward cycles in history. Finally, Jerome Powell must avoid a monetary policy error at all costs: even if it is unlikely, the possibility that a favourable trade agreement between the United States and China will be reached cannot be excluded. This could revive the American economy and lead to increased inflation, and inflation anticipations. Given high market expectations, a speech that is less dovish than expected should temporarily disappoint investors in both equities and bonds. We believe that any correction in US rates would provide an opportunity to take some duration in US bond portfolios. 874804 Want to view more?

We expect the central bank to reaffirm that it has the will to support growth and manage inflation, and the tools needed to take action. Key takeaways At the ECB\u2019s next meeting, we expect confirmation of the statements Mario Draghi made in Sintra on 18 June: the central bank is ready to take all measures to support growth and move closer to its inflation target, and will likely provide new forward guidance We do not expect any concrete action until the ECB\u2019s September meeting, which should open a sequence of lower deposit rates followed by the launch of an asset-purchase programme at the end of the year The official confirmation of this new forward guidance should be welcomed by the markets, and should help anchor rates at extremely low levels We have entered an undeclared currency war Mario Draghi\u2019s speech at the European Central Bank Forum in Sintra, Portugal, on 18 June was a major turning point in euro-zone monetary policy. The ECB\u2019s president clearly stated that the bank is willing to take all necessary measures to preserve growth and move closer to its inflation target of 2%. These statements led to a rally in all markets, a flattening of the yield curve, and a tightening of peripheral and credit spreads. Since then, the underlying context for Mr Draghi\u2019s statements has changed little: Commercial tensions are stronger than ever. The risk of a hard Brexit is still likely. Inflation remains anaemic. Despite a slight rebound in core inflation in June \u2013 to 1.1% year over year, up from a low point in May \u2013 it is expected to move around 1% in the coming months. Growth slowed in the second quarter. Inflation expectations remain low. In addition, Olli Rehn, a member of the governing council of the ECB and governor of the Bank of Finland, has since reaffirmed Mr Draghi\u2019s positions, confirming the need to respond to a macroeconomic slowdown in the euro area. He has also mentioned the tools available to the ECB, namely a lower deposit rate and a new asset-purchase programme. The ECB\u2019s next meeting on 25 July is therefore of major importance. By validating the previous announcements, now endorsed by the governing council, the ECB should confirm the modification of its forward guidance. The bank should therefore prepare the ground for its next concrete measures: in our scenario, a 10-basis-point drop in the deposit rate in September and a restart of the securities-purchase programme at the end of the year. The introduction of a multi-tier deposit facility, which was mentioned at the beginning of the year, could come back to the discussions. With the profitability of euro-zone banks being eroded by what is effectively a tax on their excess reserves, a multi-tier deposit facility similar to the one set up by central banks in Switzerland, Japan, Denmark and Sweden could be a viable option. Under this scheme, the taxation of banks\u2019 excess reserves would be triggered above a threshold that is specific to each institution. On 25 July, it will also be interesting to observe whether the new measures envisaged are unanimously agreed within the governing council: possible dissension within could weaken the scope of the message. However, the recent announcement of the change in leadership at the ECB \u2013 the expected appointment of Christine Lagarde as the ECB\u2019s next president \u2013 should not affect the strategy the central bank follows. For investors, the 25 July meeting is expected to have little impact. Even if nearly half of market participants expect a reduction of 10 basis points in July and 15 basis points by the end of the year \u2013 and therefore might be disappointed by the ECB maintaining the status quo \u2013 the official confirmation of even more accommodative monetary policy should be well-received, and should anchor rates at extremely low levels. It should be noted, however, that we have entered a phase of an undeclared currency war. Despite Mr Draghi\u2019s denials in Sintra, it is clear that the impact of expected US rate cuts on the US dollar is an element the ECB should take into account, despite the fact that the ECB has no exchange-rate target. As the European economy slows and inflation falls, an appreciation of the euro would not be appropriate, in our view. Undoubtedly, the evolution of the ECB\u2019s monetary policy will fuel accusations by US President Donald Trump that the euro is being manipulated to support growth in the euro zone; this will likely fuel disputes between the euro zone and the United States. 906594 Want to view more?

        "content": " Active is: Anticipating what\u2019s ahead EMU reform must go further to be effective 12/06/2019 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary A stronger monetary union is essential to guard Europe against future financial crises, but to achieve it, countries will have to work much closer together. Key takeaways The strength of an economy is not in its economic growth during the good times, but in its resilience during a recession The EU needs a consistent strategic vision and consolidated approach to fiscal discipline, and a way to enforce it, but too-strict control could reduce trust in EU institutions and increase nationalism Financial integration is key to making EU economies more resilient; better integration could dissipate shocks through the financial markets The EU has implemented some reforms that will prepare it for the next crisis, but more must be done Without reform, the euro may weaken and the EU stay at the periphery of the global economy \u2013 but the EMU will be blamed before the politicians Following the 2008 financial crisis, the European Union (EU) resolved to further strengthen the economic and monetary union (EMU). It implemented a number of reforms with an aim to reinforce macroeconomic and structural policies, including a banking union and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which acts as a lender of last resort. However, by 2010 economic growth in the region was recovering and discussions regarding euro-zone budgeting, further fiscal integration and approaches for cushioning asymmetric shock all fell by the wayside as political will gave way to division, tension and political mistrust. As the global economy moves late cycle and is increasingly threatened by trade rifts, Europe is likely to face recession, the depth and severity of which is unknown. With public debt at high levels and euro-zone banks owning large amounts of sovereign debt, the EU needs to continue evolving the EMU in order to safeguard its member countries and avoid the banking and sovereign doom-loop of previous crises, where national banks were laden with debt from sovereigns facing distressed financial outlooks. A number of reforms were suggested after the height of the European sovereign debt crisis with the aim of protecting the EMU against future crises: The banking union ensures that EU banks are better supervised and more transparent. It is comprised of three main elements: the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) and the controversial European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS). The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is aimed at facilitating dialogue between private and public investors to act as a lender of last resort for distressed member states. However, for the ESM to be successful and credible, it needs a Europe-wide treasury to work alongside. The capital markets union (CMU) is an initiative to unite the capital markets of the 28 EU member states with regulation affecting business interests in Europe, from banks and pension funds, to SMEs and credit rating agencies. European safe bonds (ESBs) are an instrument designed to pool national debt. They could allow financial institutions to diversify their bond holdings and break the \u201cdoom loop\u201d. However, ESBs remain a sensitive political topic which would split member states into those which are considered safe havens and those which are economically vulnerable. Target2 is a cross border payment system created to minimise systemic risk in the payments market and maintain the stability of the euro-zone money market. Since 2011 Target2 has been criticised as acting like a bailout system enabling indebted euro-zone economies the ability to borrow financial assets. Yet European capital markets remain incomplete and fiscal regulation limits government ability to respond to idiosyncratic shocks. To strengthen, the EU needs to progress further towards a capital markets union (CMU) which means first creating a functioning fiscal union. A CMU would complement the banking union and create diversification within funding sources while removing cross-country barriers, making it easier for investors to access capital markets. No longer can the EMU remain a source of division and tension and no longer can there be separation between trade and monetary arrangements. A true political union, such as that in the US, has a centralised institution to provide fiscal relief to member states in economic or financial shock. But in Europe, negative attitudes towards further integration remain; topics like a shared instrument to pool national debt remain contentious. The EU is supposed to be primarily a political union, but has been criticised for instead behaving like the sum of national egos. The proposition that European safe bonds (ESBs) may increase the stability of the banking union has also caused tension. ESBs would split member states between those that are fiscally responsible and those that are less so, essentially penalising fiscal discipline with higher interest rate costs. Yet arguably ESBs could strengthen the EMU by preventing capital flight, and helping break the loop between national banks and sovereign states. Implementation would likely mean a treaty change and, as national identity within Europe is generally stronger than any pan-European identity, any change to the treaty would likely involve years of negotiation, ratification by national parliaments, and possibly even referenda in several countries. Treaty amendments may also create ramifications for Target2 balances, which since 2012 have been used to help prop up the euro-zone banking system, and some sovereigns\u2019 ability to borrow. If one of the prerequisites for a successful EMU is a need for shared objectives, the fundamental issue in the euro zone is a lack of a consistent and consolidated approach. In the US the President and the Federal Reserve Board meet regularly and, when faced with a crisis, come together to find a resolution. In Europe, 19 different governments meet ad hoc with no framework and no regulation on how to tackle an issue, and each has a different perspective of the crisis. This in itself causes issues as, if Europe\u2019s system is to dissipate shocks, policymakers need to focus on becoming one economic and politically homogenous region. This could mean establishing a common framework on national budgets in an attempt to harmonise taxation across the region. For example, certain EU member states currently offer accommodative tax structures, resulting in accusations of behaving like tax havens. As all tax measures must be agreed unanimously by all 28 members of the EU Council member states are able to protect this status by blocking any meaningful tax reforms. Member states argue that they should be free to determine their own taxes according to national priorities. However, to create economic stability politicians need to implement European \u2013 not national \u2013 solutions. This is one of many issues against a backdrop of the recent European parliamentary elections, which show ever greater fragmentation of political parties and a rise in nationalist rhetoric. Although many euro-zone countries have similar priorities, they do not hold shared interests and this failure is the key issue underlying the argument for fiscal discipline. Ultimately, the resilience of the EMU is currently achieved through the fiscal discipline of each individual country. Stricter enforcement of this could lead to further political mistrust of central institutions, already at an all-time high due to the perceived uneven imposition of both monetary policy and fiscal austerity. This is reflected in growing budget tensions between Italy and the EU. The growth of Eurosceptic sentiment will cause yet greater divergence between political states and economic outcomes. Deeper integration and strengthened institutions could foster trust within the EU, but the current bitterness between countries has focused the debate on risk-reduction and risk-sharing. The great sadness is that the lack of political will to implement European reform will likely result in the EMU remaining ineffective and its shortcomings still present. The EU will continue to face existential risks if it is unable to secure the necessary tools to protect itself from future crises and provide an efficient monetary union. Ultimately the euro may remain weaker and at the periphery of the global economy as it will be vulnerable whenever economic difficulties emerge in the region. In the end it will be the EMU that is blamed and not the politicians. 870541 Want to view more?

Any rate hikes remain a long way off, but the 6 June meeting will see the Bank present revised economic forecasts in light of the current low inflation environment. Key takeaways The European Central Bank (ECB) has entered a pause in its monetary policy normalisation, prompted by the uncertain economic outlook, a high-risk environment and a sharp fall in inflation expectations. In this context, we do not expect any rate increases in 2019 or 2020. The ECB must provide answers regarding the drop in inflation expectations, which have fallen to historically low levels. The ECB remains unable to normalise its monetary policy following a deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. The balance of risks remains tilted to the downside, and those risks \u2013 in particular persistent uncertainties relating to Brexit, Italy and, above all, global trade tensions \u2013 are difficult to quantify. Recent months have also seen a historic fall in inflation expectations . In this context, ECB president Mario Draghi cannot hike rates. Ultimately, he is unable to do anything to normalise monetary policy beyond ending the Bank\u2019s bond-buying programme, as he did last December. And in reality, the impact of that move is limited as the Bank has undertaken to reinvest the interest and amounts corresponding to the repayment of the securities in its maturing portfolio (some \u20ac17 billion per month to maintain its stock at almost \u20ac2.6 trillion) \"over an extended period of time\". We do not expect a rate hike until 2021. Even so, the 6 June meeting could be interesting for several reasons: The ECB will update its economic forecasts. It will be difficult for it to draw a clear picture amid inconclusive data. There is an apparent disconnect as surveys and market indicators show worsening sentiment, while hard numbers such as gross domestic product and household consumption suggest resilience. It is likely that, following its first revision in March, the ECB will continue to revise its growth and inflation prospects downwards. We expect the Bank to address its failure to meet its price stability objective of 2% inflation in the medium term. Its analysis of the causes of this low inflation, and any plans as to how it will achieve the target will be keenly scrutinised by the markets. Inflation expectations have never been so low, reflecting investors' scepticism about the Bank's ability to meet its price stability objective, so the ECB will need to answer the perception that inflation remains the weak link in Mario Draghi's mandate. The Bank is also expected to provide details of the terms of the third round of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO 3) planned for September, including the borrowing rate that will be applied. The ECB has two options: to use the borrowing rate as a monetary tool, for example by matching it to the deposit rate - a way of relieving banks whose profitability is being eroded by what is effectively a 40-basis-point tax on their excess reserves; or to stick to a more restrictive acceptance of pure cash reserves in the face of uncertainty, and set a rate equal to the refinancing rate.. Finally, Mario Draghi may comment on policies that might strengthen the eurozone, in particular deepening the union of capital markets and improving budgetary coordination. Overall, this ECB meeting should have little impact on the markets, as the meeting should endorse well anchored short-term rates, paving the way for lower rates throughout the curve. Investors are currently much more sensitive to developments concerning the hot topics such as Brexit, Italy or trade tensions. 863338 Want to view more?

Most challenging for European leaders could be the signs of increasingly polarised electorates. Key takeaways Support for mainstream pro-European parties has held up, with a significant overall surge in support for populist and Eurosceptic parties failing to materialise. The European Parliament will likely end up more fragmented, with the smaller parties \u2013 of whatever political persuasion \u2013 having a greater influence in alliance-forming. Most challenging for European leaders could be the signs that their national electorates are growing increasingly polarised. A strong showing by Green parties reflects citizens\u2019 increasing focus on climate-related issues and policy \u2013 providing a key pointer for ESG investors. Looking ahead, sovereign spreads are likely to be the most sensitive to increased political uncertainty and event risk, including snap elections. Early results from the European parliament elections suggest that mainstream pro-European parties have largely held their ground, as a significant overall surge in support for populist and Eurosceptic parties failed to materialise. The major centrist parties have, however, seen big losses as the liberals, Greens and populists gain ground. The substantial increase in the Green vote in a number of countries \u2013 reflecting the progress that Green parties have made in national and local government across Northern Europe \u2013 chimes with the greater importance placed on environmental issues. The results come against the backdrop of the highest voter turnout since 1994, expected to exceed 50% \u2013 the first time that turnout has increased since European elections were first held in 1979. This outcome underscores the importance of the results and augurs well for the democratic strength and legitimacy of the European Parliament. While mainstream parties remain the strongest force, the result could make for a more fragmented European Parliament where the smaller parties \u2013 of whatever political persuasion \u2013have a greater influence. The traditional blocs, while likely still in the majority, will need to seek new alliances, and the smaller parties may play a critical role in this alliance-forming. Increasing polarisation of view The European Parliament, as co-legislator alongside the European Council \u2013 comprising heads of state or government of member states \u2013 has a decisive vote in around 90% of legislative proposals, including on single market issues and trade deals. It also formally elects the next EU Commission\u2019s President, who will be nominated by the Council. A more fragmented Parliament could make majority-based EU-level policymaking more complicated and less predictable, at a time when a strong and consistent stance is needed from the EU in areas such as trade. This more complicated parliamentary dynamic will, however, be familiar to many European leaders who are experiencing greater polarisation among their own national electorates. Indeed, the European elections confirm the trend we have seen in recent general elections in countries such as France, Italy and Germany, with an added element of the politics of protest that the European elections can engender. Political uncertainty not going away The major takeaway? These results reflect the trend seen in recent national polls, underscoring that European electorates remain divided at a critical time for the region. After six years of continuing growth, the eurozone economy has shifted into a lower gear on account of softer external demand and some country- and sector-specific factors \u2013 including disruptions in the German car industry, the \u201cgilets jaunes\u201d protests in France and rising political uncertainty in Italy. While GDP growth will come to rely almost entirely on domestic demand, the fundamental backdrop for private consumption and investment remains solid for the time being, with favourable labour market dynamics and financing conditions. That said, future progress is also reliant on a more stable political environment that is conducive to growth. Many European leaders will be relieved that populist parties did not make deeper inroads; the anti-EU movement has not yet achieved the critical mass to cause real trouble. The results don\u2019t, however, dispel the political uncertainty that has become pronounced in Europe. Country-specific political risks in member states such as Italy are already well flagged. Shaping the future of Brexit In the UK, the results came against the backdrop of the resignation of Prime Minister Theresa May and the imminent race to replace her as Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister. The new Brexit Party \u2013which campaigned for a \u201chard\u201d exit from the EU on World Trade Organisation terms \u2013 scored a notable victory, winning 32% of the vote and pushing the Conservatives into fifth place on just 9%. The results may increase the calls by Conservative Party leadership candidates to adopt a \u201cno deal\u201d stance on Brexit. That said, and underscoring the polarisation evident in the election results, the Liberal Democrats were the night\u2019s other big winner, coming second with 20%. They campaigned unequivocally on a \u201cstop Brexit\u201d ticket; anti-Brexit parties polled a combined 40% of the vote. More countries, including Greece, Austria, Portugal and Poland, will go to the polls in the coming weeks and months in what has already been a busy year for national elections. The warnings are clear: unless there is clear progress towards positive outcomes, the politics could sour towards more populist politicians in the years to come as the next election cycle approaches. The shrinking of traditional platforms (centre-left and right) and the shift to both \u201cEuropean reformist\u201d parties and populists shows that voters are urging a change of policy priorities at the EU level. First, political resistance against EU fiscal rules is growing, with populists calling for austerity policies to be abandoned. Some fiscal loosening in Europe is already underway and more should not be ruled out. Second, a focus on climate protection has been shown to mobilise young voters in particular. Investment implications The fact that pro-European parties remain the strongest force in the European Parliament should be a relief for financial markets. While EU policy-making doesn\u2019t face quite the hurdles that a bigger populist insurgency would have created, political uncertainty hasn\u2019t gone away. These polls will help shape Brussels\u2019 policy agenda for the next five years, including on EU budget and taxation, climate policy, migration policy and further moves towards European integration. They also pave the way for a changeover in top EU posts, such as Commission President, EU Council President and ECB President. The elections for these posts will be an early litmus test for whether we see functioning, cooperative institutions at an EU level. The biggest immediate implications from the European elections could be for national politics, including the future Brexit process in the UK, and government formations in Spain and possibly Italy. For the latter, there is the risk of an early election and renewed budget clash with Brussels, with the EU Commission potentially sending a warning on the Italian budget as soon as 4 June 2019. While country-specific risks are already well flagged, sovereign spreads are likely to be the most sensitive to increased political uncertainty and event risk, including snap elections. With the Green vote showing that climate change and climate protection are firmly on the agenda, environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing may become a European brand for businesses globally. 855261 Want to view more?

The stock market\u2019s Cinderella story 08/04/2019 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Much like last year's underdog, the stock markets faced some obstacles going into 2019\u2014plenty that would give them reason to extend their end-of-2018 slide. But also like the Cinderella team, stock markets overcame adversity and rallied last month, continuing to build on their impressive gains since the start of the year. With US men\u2019s basketball NCAA March Madness underway, I\u2019m reminded of an historic moment from last year\u2019s tournament, where the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) pulled off a stunning upset victory over the University of Virginia (UVA). It was the very first time in tournament history that a team with the lowest-ranking seed (no. 16) beat a highest-ranking seed (no. 1)\u2014a true Cinderella story by all accounts. Going into the historic game, it was clear UMBC had the odds stacked against them. UVA was a better team on all measurable fronts, boasting a nearly undefeated record and a notably strong defense. UMBC was a little-known school that had only made the tournament by the skin of their teeth, ranked 63 out of a field of 68 teams. But in a situation where defeat was all but a foregone conclusion, UMBC emerged from the game victorious by a wide margin, out-strategizing UVA\u2019s defense with speed and agility. Much like UMBC last year, the stock markets faced some obstacles going into 2019\u2014plenty that would give them reason to extend their end-of-2018 slide. But also like the Cinderella team, stock markets overcame adversity and rallied last month, continuing to build on their impressive gains since the start of the year. If the face of adversity for UMBC was a stronger, more accomplished team, what did the face of adversity for the stock markets look like? If I had to put it in one word, it would be this: earnings. A company\u2019s earnings don\u2019t necessarily tell the whole story of financial health (or lack thereof), but they give the market something to react to\u2014and the recent news hasn\u2019t been encouraging. Earnings surprises\u2014the degree by which earnings beat estimates\u2014came in considerably lower than the last two years, and also below the historical median. And that\u2019s just a look in the rearview\u2014the look ahead also painted a dreary picture. Analyst expectations for earnings growth have more than halved since September, and less-than-stellar sales are at least in part to blame. Increased risk of earnings recession in the US In the last four months, earnings growth estimates have precipitously declined. Source: Bloomberg. Data as at March 2019. You might be thinking this gloomy news can\u2019t possibly bode well for the stock markets, and if earnings were the only factor in play you\u2019d be right. But we\u2019ve watched two other trends unfold over the past couple of months, both of which you might have heard a few things about. First, as tensions over the US/China trade deal continued to ease, renewed investor optimism gave stocks a boost. And the second boon for the stock market came from the Federal Reserve (the \u201cFed\u201d)\u2014that entity holding the reigns of monetary policy\u2014which had previously been on a (potentially stock market-crushing) track to continue its interest rate hikes. The Fed instead declared a more patient stance on raising rates, bolstering overall confidence in markets. If we again reflect on UMBC\u2019s tournament run, we can try to glean some future learning. Just two days after their historic first round victory, UMBC lost steam and fell to Kansas State, putting an end to their historic March Madness run. If this turn of events tells us anything, it\u2019s that past performance is truly not indicative of future results, and there\u2019s a chance the same could also ring true for stock markets\u2014particularly if earnings headwinds persist. While consensus among analysts implies that we\u2019ll see earnings growth pick up again in the second half of the year, we think this may still be lofty and maintain a neutral view on US stocks. We\u2019ll continue to keep an eye on earnings expectations for later in the year, and see whether stocks can again make like UMBC\u2014prevailing in the face of earnings adversity. 806112 Want to view more?

The European Parliament will likely end up more fragmented, with the smaller parties \u2013 of whatever political persuasion \u2013 having a greater influence in alliance-forming. Most challenging for European leaders could be the signs that their national electorates are growing increasingly polarised. A strong showing by Green parties reflects citizens\u2019 increasing focus on climate-related issues and policy \u2013 providing a key pointer for ESG investors.

The ECB is also keen to preserve banks\u2019 ability to lend to the euro-zone economy. Key takeaways We expect the ECB to confirm its extremely accommodative monetary policy stance at its next meeting; the pause in normalisation could last, and short-term rates are well anchored The ECB is likely to emphasise its uncertain outlook for growth and concerns about weak inflation expectations as justification for its ultra-accommodative policy Look for the ECB to highlight that it still has room for further monetary easing, although this could fuel market uncertainty When the ECB\u2019s monetary policy committee next meets, on 10 April, we expect it to confirm its extremely dovish stance. Mario Draghi implied as much after the ECB\u2019s March meeting, when he announced the bank\u2019s intention to leave the deposit rate unchanged, at -0.40%, until at least 2020. Mr Draghi went even further during a 27 March conference, where he stated that he was reflecting on ways to preserve the benefit of negative rates for the euro-zone economy while mitigating their side effects on banks. This suggests that the horizon for a rate hike is moving further away \u2013 or even that the -0.40% deposit rate could fall further in the event of a crisis. The profitability of euro-zone banks is being eroded by what is effectively a 40-basis-point tax on their excess reserves, and the ECB is keen to preserve banks\u2019 ability to lend to the economy. This raises the possibility that the ECB might announce the implementation of a multi-tier deposit facility, similar to the one set up by central banks in Switzerland, Japan, Denmark and Sweden. Under this scheme, the taxation of banks' excess reserves would be triggered above a threshold that is specific to each institution. These new concerns could also be reflected in the terms for the third round of targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTRO 3) \u2013 cheap loans from the ECB to banks \u2013 that are planned for September. Details are not yet available, but we would not be surprised if the ECB\u2019s new TLTRO 3 facility allows participants to borrow at a rate lower than the refinancing rate (ie, a negative rate similar to TLTRO 2). The ECB used its recent statements to demonstrate that it still has room to manoeuvre \u2013 beyond the quantitative easing that is already part of its toolbox \u2013 and that its monetary policy has not reached its limits. At the same time, Europe\u2019s central bank is operating within a framework constrained by the US Federal Reserve\u2019s new \"behind the curve\" positioning, which investors perceive as a lasting pause in rate hikes. Yet we wonder about the timing and content of the ECB\u2019s new forward guidance. The ECB insists on freeing up room to manoeuvre, but that raises questions about whether it has a worse-than-expected outlook for euro-zone growth and inflation. By highlighting economic risks and emergency measures that do not seem necessary today, the ECB could be adding fuel to the uncertainty that still weighs on the markets. Never in recent times have short-term rates in the euro zone been so well anchored, which paves the way for lower rates throughout the curve \u2013 and for longer than investors expected. We think it is likely that the German yield curve will settle into negative territory for a prolonged time. In the event of a future euro-zone recession \u2013 which is not our base-case scenario \u2013 the prospect of an even more negative deposit rate could lift long-term rates into unknown territory. In this context, one thing is certain: more than ever, the motto \"never short the Bund\" seems valid. 806163 Want to view more?

        "content": " Inflation expectations support holding rates steady \u2013 for now by Franck Dixmier | 18/03/2019 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary With the Fed having largely achieved its objectives of full employment and price stability, we expect short-term rates to stay unchanged at the FOMC\u2019s next meeting. This should be good for investors, but don\u2019t rule out a rate hike by the end of the year if inflation surges, or if tariff- or Brexit-related risks recede. Key takeaways Expect the FOMC to confirm its prudent approach at its March 20 meeting: it has achieved full employment and price stability, and inflation expectations remain moderate We believe the Fed\u2019s interest-rate policy is appropriate and rates should remain unchanged for now; in our view, this provides a strong anchor for the US yield curve Still, a rate hike at the end of the year cannot be ruled out, given the US economy\u2019s resilient growth and the potential for higher inflation The Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s March 20 meeting and communications are not likely to result in any surprises; rather, we expect the Fed to confirm its new, prudent monetary-policy strategy. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell largely lifted the veil on this approach during a recent interview on \"60 Minutes\" \u2013 a widely viewed news program on US television. During the interview, Mr. Powell clearly indicated that he finds the Fed\u2019s current interest-rate policy to be appropriate given today\u2019s low US inflation levels, and that he saw no urgency to adjust interest rates. Indeed, the US central bank has largely achieved its objectives of full employment and price stability: The Fed\u2019s inflation target of around 2% has essentially been reached, with PCE (personal consumption expenditures) at 1.94%, core PCE (the Fed's preferred indicator) at 1.9% and CPI (the consumer price index) at 2.2%. Inflation expectations remain moderate, as confirmed by newly published three-year household inflation expectations. These fell from 3% to 2.8% \u2013 their lowest level in 18 months. Inflation expectations priced into two-year TIPS (Treasury inflation-protected securities) are at 1.90% \u2013 below the Fed's inflation target. Collectively, these indicators fully support a pause in the Fed\u2019s rate-hike strategy despite year-over-year wage growth of 3.4% \u2013 the highest level since 2009. Yet the Fed has been debating a new inflation approach for some time. This would entail managing its monetary policy according to an average inflation rate, tolerating the times when it temporarily overshoots its 2% target as a way to compensate for the times it undershoots that target. This potential change, which has yet to be confirmed by Mr. Powell, would allow the Fed to be more flexible and pragmatic, and it would likely create fewer surprises for the markets. It would also reinforce the Fed's desire to abandon automatic steering to stay \"behind the curve\" \u2013 an approach that entails not raising rates at a pace that keeps up with inflation. The FOMC\u2019s upcoming meeting will also be interesting in other ways: The Fed will present its forecasts for growth, inflation and short-term rates, as anticipated by the members of the FOMC. The upcoming \u201cdot plot\u201d \u2013 a chart that indicates the rate-path estimates of FOMC members \u2013 should provide information on the Fed\u2019s future monetary-policy stance. We think it is likely that the Fed expects to hike rates just one or two times by 2021 \u2013 down from previous expectations for three hikes. In its post-meeting communications, we expect the Fed to highlight several important risks to the US economy \u2013 namely tariffs with China and Europe, and political risks such as Brexit. We believe the Fed will also focus on further reducing its balance sheet \u2013 a process that started in 2017, going from a peak of USD 4.5 trillion in 2015 to USD 4 trillion today. To this last point, the minutes of the January meeting show that FOMC members unanimously supported ceasing balance-sheet reductions in 2019 to avoid making monetary conditions tighter. Mr. Powell confirmed as much in his February speech to the US House Committee on Financial Services. By not further reducing its balance sheet, the Fed will likely find it easier to manage banks' reserves to maintain short-term rates in a predefined range. However, the contents of this balance sheet remain to be seen \u2013 particularly with regard to mortgage-backed securities and bond maturities. Investors should expect the Fed to keep short-term rates at current, neutral levels for now \u2013 levels that we believe provide a strong anchor for the US yield curve, and that reinforce longer-term rates. But investors should also expect the Fed to keep all options open in the medium term as it continues watching the economic data. Growth remains resilient and above its potential, despite the fact that the latest growth statistics are difficult to decipher because of the US government's partial shutdown. Moreover, the recently released average three-month job creation rate was 180,000. Even if this figure disappointed some market-watchers, it is compatible with continued wage growth. Further, the global economy continues to slow, particularly in China and Europe. The Fed has previously noted these \u201ccross currents\u201d as a contributory factor to its current policy and will be watching global growth trends closely. While the Fed is seeking to be more flexible than ever in how it conducts monetary policy, we cannot rule out the possibility of an interest-rate hike at the end of 2019 if inflation surges or risks recede. This is our base-case scenario. It is also a source of fragility for the US bond market, which continues to anticipate that the Fed will actually cut rates in 2020, rather than hike them. 782114 Want to view more?

        "content": " Given economic uncertainty, ECB may stay accommodative by Franck Dixmier | 04/03/2019 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Changes in the euro zone\u2019s economy have raised expectations that the central bank will be more precise at its next meeting about what\u2019s causing the slowdown. We think the ECB will continue delaying rate hikes while also announcing a new liquidity program for banks. Key takeaways Amid deteriorating economic conditions and falling inflation expectations in the euro zone, the ECB\u2019s 7 March meeting is highly anticipated by the markets Investors will be awaiting news on three elements: updated prospects for euro-zone growth, an analysis of the downturn\u2019s causes and duration, and possible news of another TLTRO-style liquidity facility Fixed-income spreads in peripheral countries (especially Italy and Spain) stand to benefit from news of another liquidity program, and from renewed expectations of a first rate hike being delayed until 2020 Against the backdrop of the euro zone\u2019s deteriorating economic outlook and falling inflation expectations, the markets are highly focused on the 7 March meeting of the European Central Bank. We expect the ECB to update its growth and inflation forecasts, given that at its January meeting, ECB members noted the slowdown while questioning its duration and medium-term impacts. Moreover, the minutes of this meeting showed that the ECB found it difficult to arrive at even this uncertain conclusion. This time, we expect the central bank will provide a more precise analysis of the slowdown\u2019s impact on the euro zone\u2019s medium-term outlook and the likelihood of a rebound in the second half of the year. It will also be interesting to observe the ECB\u2019s analysis of the causes of the slowdown: are they specific to certain European sectors or countries, or are they more generally linked to global uncertainty? The other main topic of the 7 March meeting will likely be the idea of a new liquidity program. Approximately EUR 380 billion in targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) \u2013 cheap loans that the ECB provided to banks \u2013 are set to mature in June 2020. The ECB did not seem to be in a hurry to discuss a possible new liquidity plan back in January, but recent statements by Benoit Coeur\u00e9 and Peter Praet \u2013 both members of the ECB\u2019s Executive Board \u2013 are a good sign that further developments are likely. Without a new liquidity program in place, the TLTRO repayments in 2020 would have a negative impact on the ECB\u2019s balance sheet and lead to a significant tightening of monetary conditions. This would not be appropriate in the current context of an economic slowdown. We therefore think that on 7 March, the ECB will announce the launch of a new program, while waiting until a future meeting to spell out the technical details. Investors should have increased confidence that a first rate hike will occur in 2020, given the recent downward revisions to the euro-zone\u2019s growth outlook. The markets are counting on this timing, and the minutes of the January meeting show that the ECB seems quite comfortable with these expectations. The communication of a new liquidity facility should also have a positive impact on fixed-income spreads in peripheral countries, notably Italy and Spain. 759333 Want to view more?

        "content": " Caution and flexibility: a new \u201cbehind the curve\u201d strategy for the Fed by Franck Dixmier | 24/01/2019 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary In hitting pause on monetary tightening, the Fed is clearly planning to remain cautious and flexible while staying behind the curve. This offers a favourable context for risk assets in the short term. Key takeaways Fed Chair Powell's recent statements confirm a change of tone and strategy: the Fed will adopt a cautious and flexible approach to stay \u201cbehind the curve\u201d The Fed clearly wants to hit pause on monetary tightening and not increase rates in March \u2013 but it is unclear whether this is just temporary or an announced end to rate hikes For investors, this pause from the Fed is an opportunity that offers a favourable context for risk assets in the short term In the medium term, rate hikes cannot be ruled out if inflation overshoots the Fed\u2019s 2% target Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made public statements that were quite different from his comments after the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s December meeting. But it was not just the tone of his speech that had changed; its content was different as well. In his latest comments, Mr Powell made it clear that the time is over for raising rates twice in 2019 \u2013 a departure from the Fed\u2019s December message. Moreover, Mr Powell had already stated that he does not want the fed funds rate to go past neutral. Clearly, the Fed has adjusted its monetary-policy strategy and, in a cautious and flexible approach, is now remaining \u201cbehind the curve\u201d \u2013 meaning it is deliberately not raising rates to keep up with inflation. To arrive at these conclusions, the Fed has taken note of the new reality. On the one hand, inflation remains moderate and stable at 2%, despite a dynamic labour market and wage pressures. On the other hand, risks continue to increase: Economic indicators have deteriorated, with decelerating global growth and a marked slowdown occurring in China and Europe. In the United States, an extension of the partial government shutdown \u2013 the longest in history \u2013 could affect consumption now that US growth has clearly passed its peak. Political unease has not subsided. The US and China are engaged in a trade war, and US-German trade tensions could rise in February. There is also uncertainty about Brexit and European elections over the coming months. The markets have been tense. Financial conditions tightened with the sharp fourth-quarter fall in equities, and credit spreads and volatility also rose. It is worth noting that financial stability remains an implicit goal of central banks. We don\u2019t expect the Fed to hike rates at its January or March meetings. The question then becomes, will this just be a pause, or will it effectively be an announced end to the Fed\u2019s rate hikes? The markets have made their predictions clear. Fed funds futures indicate that the markets see only a 30% probability of a rate hike in 2019, and rates are even expected to go down in 2020. Yet for its part, the Fed will maintain leeway in its decision-making, meaning a rate increase in 2019 cannot be dismissed. With an unemployment rate below 4%, US growth remains above its potential, and rising wages in the face of labour-market pressures could fuel inflation. Moreover, it is interesting to note that the real fed funds rate \u2013 which accounts for the effects of inflation \u2013 is in positive territory for the first time since the financial crisis. The divergence between the message of the markets and that of the central bank has therefore diminished, but it has not disappeared. For investors, this pause from the Fed is good news in the short term, and it creates a favourable context for risk assets. In the medium term, a hike in interest rates cannot be ruled out if inflation exceeds its target. 724312 Want to view more?

Key takeaways Amid deteriorating economic conditions and falling inflation expectations in the euro zone, the ECB\u2019s 7 March meeting is highly anticipated by the markets Investors will be awaiting news on three elements: updated prospects for euro-zone growth, an analysis of the downturn\u2019s causes and duration, and possible news of another TLTRO-style liquidity facility Fixed-income spreads in peripheral countries (especially Italy and Spain) stand to benefit from news of another liquidity program, and from renewed expectations of a first rate hike being delayed until 2020 Load More "

        "content": " Europe\u2019s economic slowdown makes the proposed normalisation of ECB monetary policy harder by Franck Dixmier | 23/01/2019 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary The European Central Bank\u2019s gradual normalisation of its monetary policy should continue, but the economic slowdown in the euro-zone will likely delay any rate increases, and the window of opportunity is becoming increasingly narrow. Key takeaways At its meeting on 24 January, the ECB should consider the economic slowdown seen in the euro-zone\u2019s four largest economies during the fourth quarter of 2018 To avoid a sharp slowdown in financial conditions, the ECB should discuss the possibility of new liquidity programmes targeted to meet the needs of banks In the context of economic slowdown and a possible pause in rate hikes by the Fed, the normalisation of the ECB's monetary policy is becoming more complex The latest economic developments in the euro-zone make it harder for the European Central Bank (ECB) to continue the gradual normalisation of its monetary policy. The slowdown has impacted each of the region\u2019s four main economies: Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Each is facing specific difficulties, but all four have seen a synchronised fall in activity indicators, including purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) data. In addition, core inflation, a key indicator for the ECB, is stagnating at around 1% \u2013 far from the central bank\u2019s target of below, but close to, 2%. The ECB will have to take note of these developments. Admittedly, there is no economic forecast due at the 24 January meeting, as the next update is scheduled for March. However, ECB president Mario Draghi should recognise that the slowdown in euro-zone growth, which was seen as temporary in December, will likely last longer than expected. This should be acknowledged even if he remains confident that a recession should be avoided, as he asserted in his speech to the European Parliament in December. No one doubts the ECB will continue to act to avoid a sharper slowdown in financial conditions. Beyond the horizon of reinvestments announced in December \u2013 which could continue after the first rate hike \u2013 the central bank could also announce the possibility of new liquidity programmes in 2020. This would calm fears of markets drying up, especially in view of the targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) repayments. By maintaining its very large balance sheet (42% of the euro-zone\u2019s GDP), the ECB retains the ability to adopt an accommodative policy despite stopping its asset purchases. But will the ECB be able to raise rates in the near future? Investors are doubtful, and have pushed their expectations of a first hike in the deposit rate to the second half of 2020. The window of opportunity is becoming increasingly narrow: the ECB can hardly act in a context of economic slowdown, but by waiting too long, it could face other headwinds \u2013 the Fed may well lower its rates in 2020, as anticipated by the markets a few days ago. We are not expecting any significant impact on the market as a result of this ECB meeting, which should only confirm the expectations investors already largely hold. 720536 Want to view more?

        "content": " Outlook & commentary Brexit - going through the motions by Neil Dwane | 16/01/2019 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary On 15 January, UK prime minister Theresa May suffered a resounding parliamentary defeat on her EU withdrawal bill. An unsettled couple of weeks now lie ahead. On 15 January, UK prime minister Theresa May suffered a resounding parliamentary defeat on her EU withdrawal bill, with 432 MPs voting against the bill (including 118 of her own MPs) versus 202 in favour. The bill set out the terms of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU on 29 March, beginning a 21-month transition period during which a trade deal could be agreed. An unsettled couple of weeks now lie ahead. In response to the vote, the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, tabled a vote of no confidence, potentially triggering a general election. We think it unlikely that this motion will succeed. Per the amendment tabled by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, Mrs May has until 21 January to return to parliament with a \u201cPlan B\u201d. The sheer scale of Mrs May\u2019s defeat underlines once more the deep divide among MPs and suggests that achieving a majority for a deal in a potential second vote will remain very challenging \u2013 unless we see material concessions by the EU or changes in the government\u2019s position. Realistically, there\u2019s limited scope for substantive concessions from the EU, aside from cosmetic tweaks to the non-legally binding declaration on the future partnership. For example, the EU could come up with further non-binding \u201cclarifications\u201d on how to work on customs processing systems for Ireland within a given time frame. Meanwhile, the Brexit clock is ticking fast, with little more than 70 days until the UK is due to leave the EU. It is hard to see what can be achieved within the current Brexit timetable. As such, the prospect of an extension of the 29 March deadline has risen. The Commons defeat suffered by Mrs. May could give her an opportunity to change tack, and she has pledged cross-party talks ahead of a second parliamentary vote. Similarly, the likely defeat of Mr Corbyn\u2019s no confidence motion may cause him to move to a new position. Whether he would push for a second referendum thereafter remains a point of speculation. Against this backdrop, we think an extension to the March 29 deadline is the more likely of potential outcomes. The main question is the basis on which the EU agrees to this extension. While a \u201cno-deal Brexit\u201d remains a potential outcome, the operational hurdles for a \u201ccrashing out\u201d on 29 March have risen following (i) the European Court of Justice ruling that the UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50 and (ii) a parliamentary vote giving MPs more control over negotiations. Looking ahead: Uncertainty persists. Even if a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d scenario is avoided, uncertainty will persist given that any agreed withdrawal deal will merely set the scene for the future trade relationship. Therefore, investors and companies need to prepare for a wide range of scenarios. The impact of Brexit will be uneven. Whatever the ultimate Brexit \u201cend state\u201d, more frictions in trade with Europe seem unavoidable. This will affect EU member states, the UK and its various sectors differently. For the UK, time and active trade policies are necessary to mitigate some losses from higher restrictions to EU trade, but this may not offset them completely. Brexit entails a bumpy ride for UK assets. But the UK stock market is not the UK economy. Seventy percent of FTSE 100 revenues are generated overseas. The dichotomy between internationally and domestically oriented UK stocks might well continue. 738905 Want to view more?

        "content": " Fed is set to hold steady, which could surprise markets by Franck Dixmier | 17/12/2018 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary A host of US economic issues \u2013 from trade tensions to a flattened yield curve \u2013 has drastically reduced expectations of rate hikes after the FOMC\u2019s December meeting. Yet the Fed sees a healthy US economy and may announce it is forging ahead, which could catch investors off guard and trigger volatility. Key takeaways Ahead of the FOMC\u2019s December meeting, fed funds rate forecasts moved sharply lower \u2013 showing a 70% probability of an increase in December, virtually no expectation of a hike in 2019 and a rate decrease in 2020 Yet we believe signs of a strong US economy mean the Fed will likely confirm its monetary-tightening strategy at its 18-19 December meeting Still, the Fed has consistently demonstrated that it is not on autopilot and will make decisions based on the latest macroeconomic developments; that could mean more unpredictability and more market volatility The next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee will be an important one, given the major differences between the markets' expectations and the Federal Reserve\u2019s own analysis of the US economy. If the Fed surprises investors by pledging to forge ahead with its monetary-tightening policy, it could result in higher volatility and a steeper US yield curve. The FOMC\u2019s 18-19 December meeting will be held against a tense backdrop, consisting of many issues that have come to the fore in recent weeks: Trade tension between China and the United States. Concerns about US economic growth. High volatility and sharp corrections in the US equity market. Scepticism over the Fed's ability to pursue its monetary-tightening policy. Lower inflation expectations. A drastic flattening of the US yield curve. These developments can be seen in downward revisions to the fed funds rate forecasts, which reflect a 70% probability of a rate increase in December, likely no expectation of a hike in 2019 and a rate decrease in 2020. Yet we believe the markets may need to change this view, since a number of the indicators on which the central bank bases its analysis show a healthy \u2013 even robust \u2013 US economy: The purchasing managers\u2019 index reached 54.7% at the end of November, indicating an expansion in manufacturing activity. Consumer confidence moved higher. o Industrial orders rebounded, hitting 3.4% at the end of October vs 1.5% in September. The unemployment rate is at its lowest level (3.7%) in nearly 50 years. Wages grew at 3.1% year-on-year through the end of November. Purchasing power appears set to benefit from the drop in oil prices. Given the strength of these figures \u2013 visible in the Fed\u2019s forecasts from September and recent comments from FOMC members \u2013 we believe the central bank is likely to forge ahead with its monetary-tightening plans and confirm its rate-hiking strategy. Admittedly, the Fed could trim its 2019 rate-increase forecasts from three to two, but we believe it won\u2019t project anything less. As such, there is probably an element of surprise attached to the December FOMC meeting: investors could be caught off guard and be forced to adjust their expectations, fuelling volatility and causing the US yield curve to steepen again. Whatever happens, the Fed has demonstrated that it is moving towards a neutral monetary policy \u2013 a fed funds rate of around 3% \u2013 and that it is no longer on autopilot. Every future decision on interest rates will likely be judged against the latest macroeconomic developments. That could make the Fed\u2019s decision-making process more unpredictable, which we believe would mean more volatility ahead. All data from Bloomberg as at 12 December 2018. Investing involves risk.

        "content": " ECB likely to stay the course, despite uncertainties by Franck Dixmier | 10/12/2018 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary As the European Central Bank continues the very gradual normalisation of its monetary policy, we expect it will soon announce the wrap-up of its bond-buying programme. But this won\u2019t signal the end of its accommodation: the central bank has multiple tools at its disposal to carry out its duties. Key takeaways Despite disappointing numbers about euro-zone growth and inflation, we believe the ECB will stay the course and announce its final bond-buying wind-down at its 13 December meeting Even as its asset-purchase programme ends, the central bank will still be accommodative: it can be flexible with its reinvestment policy, the timing of rate hikes and the availability of long-term loans for euro-zone banks The continuation of the ECB\u2019s accommodative policy will likely be good news for investors, some of whom fear premature monetary tightening There is little doubt that the European Central Bank will announce the wrap-up of its asset-purchase programme at its next meeting on 13 December, but recently announced data make the timing of this meeting awkward. The euro-zone growth rate has slowed, reaching only 0.2% in the third quarter, according to Bloomberg \u2013 the worst performance in four years. Inflation has also grown weaker: overall inflation was 2% in November against 2.2% in October, and core inflation was 1% against 1.1%. Despite these disappointing numbers, we believe the ECB will stay the course for its final bond-buying wind-down. ECB President Mario Draghi suggested as much in his recent comments to the European Parliament, as did the minutes of the ECB\u2019s last meeting in October. The central bank likely views the recent data slowdown as the result of temporary headwinds rather than a permanent shift. In addition, the euro-zone\u2019s peak growth in 2017 makes the latest data appear worse in comparison. Even though we do not expect a surprise announcement on 13 December, it will still be interesting to take note of the ECB\u2019s updated economic forecasts \u2013 which will incorporate 2021 for the first time. We expect the central bank\u2019s projected growth rate to be revised down only slightly despite the recent drop in oil prices, since cheaper oil should re-inject purchasing power and consequently boost core inflation. This is all supportive of the ECB\u2019s very gradual normalisation of monetary policy, in our view. It would be wrong to think that the end of the central bank\u2019s asset-purchase programme will signal the end of its accommodation. The ECB is clearly in control and has important policy tools at its disposal to carry out its duties. Three tools in particular will be key in 2019: The terms of the ECB\u2019s reinvestment policy. While EUR 212 billion in maturing debt is expected to be reinvested in 2019, many unknowns remain. To date, the ECB has not indicated the reinvestment horizon, nor the duration of the new bonds purchased, nor the allocation of the purchases between public and private debt. The timing of the first interest-rate hike. While earlier ECB guidance may have prompted the markets to anticipate a rate hike in the autumn of next year, the latest expectations are for the first rate increase to occur in the spring of 2020. The ability to offer new long-term loans to meet banks\u2019 needs. The ECB would use this tool if a liquidity squeeze hit the markets, particularly given that many banks are due to repay existing cheap loans known as targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). We don\u2019t expect the ECB to give much detail, if any, on these three points at its next meeting. This is to ensure it maintains the ability to react to changes in the economy. However, the continuation of the ECB\u2019s accommodative policy will likely be good news for investors, some of whom fear premature monetary tightening. The next meeting should also not change the perspective of euro-zone bond markets, which are currently more influenced by strong risk aversion than by fundamentals. Investing involves risk.

        "content": " Outlook & commentary Are trade headlines hiding a \u2018tech cold war\u2019? by Neil Dwane | 23/11/2018 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary If trade tensions continue, the US and China could lock each other out and create their own tech ecosystems, forcing the rest of the world to choose one over the other. With the global economy already becoming less synchronised, investors will need to use greater skill and agility to navigate the markets successfully. Key takeaways A new tech cold war may be building, with mutual distrust leading the US and China to reduce their reliance on one other\u2019s technology The global supply chain of technology and its components could be materially disrupted, creating new winners and losers Index weightings would be slow to reflect changes from a fast-moving tech cold war, which provides opportunities that active asset management and fundamental research can aim to capture One of President Donald Trump\u2019s policy priorities has been to implement wide-ranging trade reforms \u2013 with a particular focus on China. In an attempt to pressure China into changing perceived unfair trade practices, the US has levied USD 50 billion in tariffs on imported goods \u2013 from auto parts to medical devices \u2013 and proposed another USD 200 billion. China, in turn, has retaliated with its own dollar-for-dollar counter-tariffs on airplanes, automobiles, farm products and more. Yet while the increasing trade tensions between the US and the rest of the world are understandably worrying the markets, we believe the more important story is the potential for a \u201ctech cold war\u201d. The Trump administration has made it clear that it views China as a strategic technological competitor, and it may be aiming to stop China\u2019s access to cutting-edge US technologies completely. This could transform the economic and investment landscape \u2013 lowering profit margins, inhibiting innovation and disrupting everything from mega-cap tech firms to small-scale suppliers. In times like these, an active investment strategy based on fundamental research can help investors select where to put their money to work, rather than passively accept market returns. Opening salvos in a tech cold war To the Trump administration, one of China\u2019s most unfair trade practices is its alleged theft of US patents and intellectual property over multiple years. This is not a new view: other US administrations and intelligence agencies have drawn similar conclusions and attempted to secure their technology from theft and hacking. In addition to using tariffs to combat this problem, the US is also implementing export controls, pursuing indictments and proposing sanctions. Another issue that makes the US nervous is China\u2019s strategy for competing with the US and other developed nations in advanced manufacturing \u2013 its so-called \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d programme. By shifting China\u2019s industrial capabilities into high-tech areas such as aerospace and robotics \u2013 and away from apparel, consumer electronics and other lower-value products \u2013 China hopes to avoid the \u201cmiddle-income trap\u201d to which so many emerging economies have succumbed. China\u2019s economy is increasingly dependent on high-tech industries Importance of high-tech industries vs dependence on manufacturing Source: Allianz Global Investors Economics & Strategy; European Chamber, China Manufacturing 2025. Data as at March 2017. Casualties on both sides In a tech cold war, the US and China could lock each other out of access to one another\u2019s supply chains and develop their own discrete tech ecosystems \u2013 forcing the rest of the world to choose one over the other. This would disrupt many of the world's most important supply chains, which are often long and complicated and can frequently cross back and forth between multiple countries and regions. Taking out even one link could cause cascading effects both up and down the line, impacting investors in unforeseen ways. The prospect of serious supply-chain disruption would likely force countries around the world to make delicate and difficult decisions. The US high-tech ecosystem may be favoured by Europe because of the existing ties between the two regions \u2013 security, trade and existing infrastructure all play a role. Yet Japan, South Korea and Taiwan may struggle harder with their choices. China could win out over the longer term, thanks to its growth potential and access to peripheral Asia-Pacific markets. If a tech cold war persists, it could be so damaging to the existing world order that it prevents a return to globalisation \u2013 even if today\u2019s populist, anti-globalisation mood eventually dissipates. Perhaps most significantly, a tech cold war could revive the \"us versus them\" environment that existed during the US-Russia cold war, particularly amid fears over US-China cyberspace conflicts and China\u2019s growing military presence in the South China Sea. How China could retaliate Although China has already implemented counter-tariffs, it has so far held off on further significant actions \u2013 possibly in the hopes that Mr Trump will be a one-term president. But if China decides to retaliate further, it could take multiple approaches: Devaluing the renminbi, which is sitting close to an important 7:1 level with the US dollar. Selling its USD 3 trillion in US Treasury holdings, though completely divesting would be very difficult. Reducing the amount of rare earth elements China makes available to the global tech supply chain. REEs are crucial to the manufacturing of batteries, mobile phones, fibre optics and more \u2013 and China controls 95% of the world\u2019s REE supply, according to the US Geological Survey. Increasing its retaliatory tariffs on US goods; this could have spillover effects, including on German car companies that produce autos in the US. Targeting American brands in China \u2013 from smartphone manufacturers to car companies to fast-food chains. Economic and investment implications The global economy is already becoming less synchronised and more divergent \u2013 and investors need to use greater skill and agility to navigate the markets successfully. A tech cold war would only exacerbate this shift. Global growth could suffer from worker displacement and less innovation. If high-tech advances are no longer shared and economies of scale no longer globalised, growth could shrink even more. If forced to choose between two competing eco-systems, the Asian economies that form the bedrock of the global manufacturing system could be hurt disproportionately. It would be extremely difficult for the US to moving offshore manufacturing and assembly to onshore US locations \u2013 or to re-offshore them to other countries. Both moves could result in lower profit margins and higher prices for US companies, which in turn could lower demand for their goods and services. The tech sector is the largest single component of major US and Asian indices; any disruptions could push down valuations and earnings. In times like these, a passive, index-based approach may not be the best way to manage risk and capture opportunities. Because index weightings can lag market movements, index investors could be forced to hold companies that are losing out in a high-tech reshuffling while missing out on the firms that are positioned well for the future. Focusing on a limited number of issuers, sectors (such as the technology sectors), industries or geographic regions increases risk and volatility. Investing involves risk.

But this won\u2019t signal the end of its accommodation: the central bank has multiple tools at its disposal to carry out its duties. Key takeaways Despite disappointing numbers about euro-zone growth and inflation, we believe the ECB will stay the course and announce its final bond-buying wind-down at its 13 December meeting Even as its asset-purchase programme ends, the central bank will still be accommodative: it can be flexible with its reinvestment policy, the timing of rate hikes and the availability of long-term loans for euro-zone banks The continuation of the ECB\u2019s accommodative policy will likely be good news for investors, some of whom fear premature monetary tightening Load More "

        "content": " With mid-terms over, markets may feel relief 07/11/2018 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Although the Democrats now control half of the US Congress, we believe President Trump\u2019s economic agenda is unlikely to be significantly altered. A divided government could also give equities a bounce, particularly now that election-related uncertainty has been removed. Key takeaways With a divided Congress, President Trump's economic agenda will likely not be altered much, but we believe a second tax-reform bill is unlikely to pass Democrats may push back harder on the president's trade agenda, but there likely won\u2019t be bipartisan support to alter his approach There may be bipartisan legislative support for more infrastructure projects, lower drug prices and higher overall government spending Equities have historically done well after mid-terms, and after the S&P 500\u2019s 7% correction in October, the markets may be well-positioned for a bounce Sectors that may fare well under a divided Congress include industrials, materials, technology and health care; sectors that may feel pressure include financials and defence The US mid-term elections on 6 November resulted in a divided Congress \u2013 commonly referred to as \u201cgridlock\u201d \u2013 that has several economic implications: President Donald Trump\u2019s economic agenda \u2013 centred around tax reform, de-regulation and renegotiated trade deals \u2013 will likely not be altered materially. However, we now see the passing of a second tax reform bill as unlikely. Governing via executive orders and executive branch actions will likely continue. This implies that while we may see Democrats become more vocal in pushing back on over-reach in the President\u2019s trade agenda, it is unlikely that Congress will achieve the bipartisan support needed to alter his approach officially. As 2020 draws closer, the work of Congress will shift gears increasingly toward the presidential, House and Senate elections, putting major legislative initiatives closer and closer to the back burner. As a result, we may not see much progress on either party\u2019s agenda, as they will not want to give the other a \u201cwin\u201d prior to presidential elections. Some expected results, some surprises At the time of this writing, the Democratic Party has won a majority in the House of Representatives, though some elections are unresolved. Democrats won 221 of the 435 seats up for election, flipping 27 seats from Republican to Democrat (with 16 races still undecided). Meanwhile, the Republican Party maintained control of the Senate, winning 10 of the 35 seats up for election (with 4 left undecided) and bringing the total number of Republican seats to 51 out of 100 (likely extending to 53 seats). While the overall result of a split Congress was not surprising, what was perhaps somewhat unexpected was the extent to which the Democrats won in the House \u2013 extending their majority well beyond the 23 seats required. Also unexpected was the Republicans extending their majority in the Senate, moving from a simple 51-seat majority to a likely 53 seats. Other notable aspects of the 2018 mid-term election race include: Record numbers of women and minorities were elected. In the House, women won 96 seats and counting, surpassing the prior record of 85 seats, and Congress saw the election of its first Native American and Muslim representatives. Voter turnout was high. It is estimated that 114 million votes were cast in the 2018 mid-term elections, compared to 83 million four years ago. A record amount of money was spent. The total amount spent on mid-term election campaigns is estimated at a record USD 5.2 billion, a 35% increase from four years ago. Policy impact One of the biggest takeaways from the elections is that a Democratic House now provides some checks and balances to a Republican president and Republican Congress \u2013 or at least more vocal opposing views. While the Democrat-controlled House could also increase its focus on legal proceedings related to President Trump \u2013 notably ahead of the 2020 presidential elections \u2013 we do not ultimately believe Democrats will push for impeachment. Impeachment would require support from two-thirds of the Senate, which is highly unlikely. There may be certain policy areas that may see a modicum of progress: Infrastructure. Both parties had indicated they wanted to put an infrastructure package in place. The total will likely now be less than the USD 1 trillion proposed by the Democrats, and there may be debate on how to fund such a bill. However, this could be one of the few areas that appeals to both parties and their constituents. Drug pricing. Health care is an issue on which many Democrats based their elections, and both President Trump and Democrats generally favour lower drug prices. Implementing this policy would not only support the lower- and middle-income US consumer, but appeal to President Trump\u2019s base as well; it would however negatively impact certain pharmaceutical and drug companies. Government spending. We may see less defence spending under a mixed Congress, as President Trump may have to compromise to get a spending bill in place in 2019. However, the Democrats may favour higher spending in general, which seems in line with the President\u2019s overall philosophy as well. Social issues. Legislators may focus more on key social issues, including gun control, addressing the opioid crisis and immigration reform. Of these, the President has expressed interest in managing the opioid epidemic and has shown some, albeit wavering, support for incremental gun control legislation. Market impact Generally, we believe that the markets \u2013 particularly US equities \u2013 were well-positioned heading into the mid-term elections, given that the S&P 500 Index had already experienced a 7% correction in October. This is in line with the historical narrative that the markets tend to be volatile prior to mid-term elections, and then outperform in the 6-12 months after elections. Outlook for equities Gridlock could be positive for equities. The fiscal stimulus of tax reform and much of the deregulation agenda is already \u201clocked in\u201d and the Democrats may push back on some of President Trump\u2019s trade policy proposals that have weighed on markets. As noted in the accompanying chart, markets historically moved upwards by an average of 12% in the 12 months after elections resulted in a split Congress and a Republican president. Stocks have historically gained 12% per year under a Republican president and divided Congress Average annual S&P 500 total returns based on control of White House and Congress (1928-present) Source: Bank of America Merrill Lynch Research, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at 2017. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The above graph is illustrative in nature and should not be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell a specific security, strategy or product. Among the sectors that may fare well: Industrials and materials, if infrastructure reform is enacted Technology, if trade tensions dissipate Health care, since gridlock reduces the risk of major policy overhauls (excluding pharmaceutical/drug companies if reduced drug pricing is enacted) Among the sectors that may feel pressure: Financials, if rates soften and Democrats push back on deregulation The defence sector, if Congress reaches a compromise to restrain spending (although we may get some compromise here as well, if Democrats favour overall increased spending) Effect on rates/currencies We believe increased gridlock in Washington will likely dampen investors\u2019 appetite for risk, putting downward pressure on rates. It essentially eliminates the chances of additional tax cuts, and could also portend higher spending and a regulatory environment that is less favourable for business. This would likely reduce the long-term growth outlook and create downward pressure on the US dollar. Impact on emerging markets Gridlock could give a small boost to developing markets, since the US dollar could soften or stabilise under the policy uncertainty created by a split Congress. The rhetoric from the Democrats may not be as protectionist in nature, particularly with regard to US allies. What\u2019s next after the elections? Now that the uncertainty around mid-term elections has been resolved, we believe investors will refocus on the key issues at hand for 2019. Chief among them are the Federal Reserve\u2019s normalisation path, the potential escalation in tariffs in January (or perhaps a positive resolution at the G20 meeting in November), and whether the US decoupling from a softening global economy is sustainable. These may be the primary market drivers in the near future. Investment implications Equities have historically done well after mid-term election uncertainty has been resolved, and markets may be set up well for solid year-end performance \u2013 albeit with ongoing volatility Markets tend to like gridlock, which generally means the status quo will be maintained Sectors that may fare well: industrials, materials, technology, health care Sectors that may feel pressure: financials and possibly defence Emerging markets could get a modest boost from a softer US dollar Investors will soon refocus on broader economic issues: the Fed, trade and global growth Investing involves risk.

        "content": " Outlook & commentary The unintended consequences of saving the world from the financial crisis by Neil Dwane | 02/11/2018 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary The response of central banks to the financial crisis 10 years ago may have saved the world from a devastating depression, but it also created a host of unforeseen effects \u2013 from more indebtedness to more economic inequality. Looking back at what we got right \u2013 and what went wrong \u2013 what lessons can we take away for the future? Key takeaways 10 years after the financial crisis, the global economy arguably solved a debt crisis with more debt, made affordable by low interest rates and quantitative easing Low yields have made safe returns hard to find \u2013 yet strict investment guidelines and risk-aversion have left many investors unable to escape the effects of financial repression Fundamental and structural reforms remain elusive for many economies, as Japan has shown over the last 30 years Political uncertainty and populist politics could continue to rise as each economy comes under pressure to grow and deleverage simultaneously Inflation remains the enemy for investors: it is the \u201cstealth default\u201d solution for a world with too much debt In 10 years, central banks changed the world The global economy suffered a financial heart attack 10 years ago, when Lehman Brothers collapsed and a credit crunch roiled the financial markets. The economy was revived by aggressive intervention from major central banks, which reduced interest rates to low or sub-zero levels and use quantitative easing (QE) to grow their balance sheets to more than USD 15 trillion, according to the Financial Times. This has created a wealth effect across equity, bond and property markets \u2013 a \u201crising tide\u201d that helped the financial industry and affluent investors. Yet it has not, in fact, helped the global economy fully recover. Instead, we solved a debt crisis by creating more debt \u2013 which made economic inequality worse, encouraged populist politics and strengthened anti-globalisation sentiment. One decade after the financial crisis, perhaps it\u2019s too early to celebrate victory. Instead, it may be time to consider all the other ways in which the world was altered by the actions of central banks. Central banks are normalising monetary policy, but slowly Source: Allianz Global Investors Global Economics & Strategy, Bloomberg, Datastream, World Bank, Eurostat. Data as at 30 September 2018. Ultra-loose monetary policy had a range of unintended consequences... ...for savers Post-financial crisis, central banks globally pursued a policy of financial repression \u2013 a series of actions designed to stimulate the economy and reduce debt while maintaining inflation. Yet with interest rates cut to ultra-low or even sub-zero levels, savers lost the ability to earn a return without taking risk while those who over-borrowed or over-spent escaped mostly unscathed. Older generations in or near retirement were particularly hurt, unable to earn even a modest return on savings they were unwilling to risk. ... for investors QE and zero-interest-rate policies deliberately drove investors to take more risk to earn a return, and created a remorseless \u201chunt for income\u201d. By driving bond yields ever lower, central banks interfered with the allocation of capital and encouraged the use of leverage. This \u201ccentral bank put\u201d \u2013 which lowered interest rates and provided liquidity to calm markets \u2013 managed to lower financial-market volatility, but it had several significant downsides. One was that low rates encouraged procyclical flows into passive investments as investors stopped looking for value and instead focused on riding yesterday\u2019s winners. Over time, stocks and sectors became increasingly correlated as their performance moved almost in lockstep. In fact, according to Bloomberg, 10 stocks accounted for 50% of the S&P 500\u2019s size in the first half of 2018 \u2013 including the \u201cFANGs\u201d (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google). As central bank liquidity flowed in and the wealth effect spread, equity and real estate valuations accelerated. This further exacerbated economic inequality and forced some investors to re-evaluate long-standing valuation tools such as price-to-earnings ratios, which sometimes were so high as to be almost meaningless. As equity owners enjoyed a steady upwards march, fixed-income investors hunted for income, pushing the yields of some USD 10 trillion in bonds into negative territory, according to the Financial Times. This left the investors who owned them all but certain of a financial loss. Monetary policy helped push home and equity prices back near pre-crisis levels Source: Thomson Reuters Datastream, AllianzGI Economics & Strategy. Data as at 13 August 2018. Chart shows prices indexed to 100 in 1985. ... for shareholders and corporations Some elements of traditional equity ownership have been upended in the wake of the financial crisis \u2013 at times even the idea of buying shares in profitable businesses. With debt readily available from the credit markets, some corporations have created disruptive new business models that de-emphasised real profits. Instead, they began focusing on making their share prices more attractive by adjusting their debt-to-equity balances, undermining competitors who actually needed to make money. Low interest rates have also prompted many companies to take on increasing levels of debt that they used to buy back shares. Some estimates show that annual share buybacks in the US have reached 3%-5% of US GDP. In recent years, corporate board remuneration has also become a concern. The practice of aligning board-member compensation with share prices has \u2013 thanks to the long-term run-up in equities \u2013 has ensured ever-higher levels of compensation for board members. The same holds true with executive pay, which ballooned at a time when wages for much of the rest of society stagnated. When boards and management teams spend more time managing their company\u2019s share price than the business itself, it can easily lead to less investment and more risky financial engineering. ... for governments Low interest rates have raised the cost of funding corporate and government pensions and other long-term liabilities, and many pension funds and insurance companies have been forced by regulation to own unattractive sovereign bonds that are set to lose value as interest rates rise. Worse still, poor accounting by some states has hidden the real cost of some of these liabilities. Populations around the world are also ageing, placing a greater burden of care on governments that are already over-borrowing and making unaffordable welfare promises. These obligations will likely be met only through a combination of inflation, which destroys the value of those debts, and default, as some of these obligations are likely to be abrogated by future generations. Because most governments did not use the time bought by central banks to restructure and reenergise their economies, they may well face the next crisis in a weaker state and with no new reforms in place. Banks have also been forced to hold more capital and will likely not be in a position \u2013 for good or for ill \u2013 to provide enough liquidity to the markets when the next crisis comes. Post-crisis, global consumer inflation has re-accelerated Source: Allianz Global Investors Global Economics & Strategy, OECD, Bloomberg, Datastream, World Bank. Data as at 30 September 2018. ... for economies The past 10 years of low rates and central-bank liquidity injections have helped create a collection of \u201czombie\u201d companies \u2013 generally older and weaker firms with interest expenses that exceed their operating profits. Because banks have an incentive to minimise write-downs in order to limit losses and avoid expensive recapitalisations, they frequently extend the loan-payoff period for weak borrowers \u2013 a process known as \u201cevergreening\u201d. Japan has suffered from these zombies for 30 years, and the US and Europe seem to be heading down a similar path. Ideally, a market-based economy should seek to allocate capital to opportunities most likely to generate a profitable return. But by not allowing economies to \u201cclear\u201d, central banks have invited all the consequent effects of low innovation and productivity. Moreover, perpetuating zombies both undermines good companies and creates the stagnancy that leads to social and political frictions. Also importantly, low interest rates produce two different reactions to investing and saving. In Germany, for example, savers tend to save more when rates are low to keep their plans on target. Meanwhile, in the UK or US, savers tend to spend their windfalls \u2013 thinking that with returns so low, their savings wouldn\u2019t earn enough anyway, so why not get something they can use? The net result at a global level is that consumption has been advanced by the lack of saving while leverage has grown rapidly. Indeed, in the global economy, growth is increasingly hard to come by: economies must now use 7 units of debt-to-GDP to create 1 unit of that GDP, leaving many economies and consumers living for today and trying not to think about tomorrow. The importance of learning from history As we note the 100-year anniversary of the end of the first world war on 11 November, now is an appropriate time for sober reflection. History has shown us time and again that peace and prosperity must be earned, and a number of factors must all align to maintain this delicate equilibrium \u2013 from geopolitical accord and international cooperation to sustainable fiscal and monetary policies. Ten years after the financial crisis, the consequences of our collective response to save the world from a second Great Depression are still working their way through the system. But there may be signs that the social and political \u201cpact\u201d that we have relied on for peace is beginning to fray. As the American philosopher Georges Santayana once said, \u201cthose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\u201d. It is an important reminder for all of us to continue trying to learn from our successes \u2013 and our mistakes.

A divided government could also give equities a bounce, particularly now that election-related uncertainty has been removed. Key takeaways With a divided Congress, President Trump's economic agenda will likely not be altered much, but we believe a second tax-reform bill is unlikely to pass Democrats may push back harder on the president's trade agenda, but there likely won\u2019t be bipartisan support to alter his approach There may be bipartisan legislative support for more infrastructure projects, lower drug prices and higher overall government spending Equities have historically done well after mid-terms, and after the S&P 500\u2019s 7% correction in October, the markets may be well-positioned for a bounce Sectors that may fare well under a divided Congress include industrials, materials, technology and health care; sectors that may feel pressure include financials and defence Load More "

        "content": " Volatile markets and politics won\u2019t change the Fed\u2019s path by Franck Dixmier | 02/11/2018 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary The strong economic foundation in the US continues to validate the Fed\u2019s trajectory, despite the increased risk-aversion recently seen in the markets. As a result, we expect the FOMC to stay on its path, free from political pressure, and continue monetary-policy normalisation. Key takeaways The latest economic data continue to give the Fed confidence about the growth prospects for the US economy The Fed is willing to stop its monetary stimulus and raise rates beyond the neutral rate \u2013 but it will be pragmatic and keep an eye on the economic data We expect a rate hike to be announced at the Fed\u2019s December meeting, for a total of four rate hikes in 2018 At this stage, we do not expect the recent increase in risk-aversion and stockmarket volatility to deflect the US Federal Reserve from its path. The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s 25-26 September meeting are particularly enlightening on this point. The Fed remains confident and optimistic about the growth prospects for the US economy \u2013 particularly the ability of most of the firms affected by tariffs to transfer those price increases to households. The minutes also show that the last rate hike was unanimously passed, and that the majority of the committee members favoured going beyond the neutral rate \u2013 the interest-rate level that neither stimulates nor restrains economic growth. Estimates for the neutral rate currently range from 2.5% to 3%. As a result, the message from the Fed is clear and the markets have understood it. As proof, the markets have not revised their rate-hike expectations and still anticipate three increases by the end of 2019. This view has taken root despite an increase in risk-aversion in the face of slower growth in China, fears about Brexit and Italy\u2019s fiscal trajectory, geopolitical tensions and the rise of protectionism \u2013 all of which have contributed to high volatility in equity markets. The Fed\u2019s confidence is based on economic data that demonstrate the strength of economic activity in the United States. In the third quarter, the US economy grew at a 3.5% annual growth rate \u2013 a dip from the second quarter\u2019s 4.2% rate, but still well above its potential. This growth was driven by consumer spending, which rose for the seventh consecutive month (at a 4% annualized rate) and was a direct consequence of President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts. Core PCE \u2013 the inflation indicator favoured by the Fed, which measures personal consumption expenditures \u2013 remained stable at 2% for the fifth consecutive month. An increase in prices and wages are being offset by a slowdown in real-estate prices. This convergence of economic activity clearly indicates a US economy that is rolling along and validates the Fed\u2019s willingness to stop the monetary stimulus and go beyond the neutral rate. As a result, we expect the FOMC to stay on its path, free from political pressure, and continue monetary-policy normalisation. We therefore expect a rate hike to be announced at the Fed's 18-19 December meeting, for a total of four increases in 2018. We also expect two further hikes in 2019. It is important to note, however, that the Fed will not put its rate-hike plans on autopilot. The central bank wants to find room to manoeuvre in case the US economy reaches its inflexion point. But the FOMC will be pragmatic and keep an eye on the evolution of economic data, in total independence from political pressure. Investing involves risk.

Looking back at what we got right \u2013 and what went wrong \u2013 what lessons can we take away for the future? Key takeaways 10 years after the financial crisis, the global economy arguably solved a debt crisis with more debt, made affordable by low interest rates and quantitative easing Low yields have made safe returns hard to find \u2013 yet strict investment guidelines and risk-aversion have left many investors unable to escape the effects of financial repression Fundamental and structural reforms remain elusive for many economies, as Japan has shown over the last 30 years Political uncertainty and populist politics could continue to rise as each economy comes under pressure to grow and deleverage simultaneously Inflation remains the enemy for investors: it is the \u201cstealth default\u201d solution for a world with too much debt Load More "

        "content": " Politics are driving the BoE's decisions by Mike Riddell | 25/10/2018 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Brexit negotiations will be the biggest factor in whether the Bank of England changes its monetary policy \u2013 which means the BoE will likely be driven by politics for the next few months. Don\u2019t expect a rate hike at the central bank\u2019s November meeting, but inflation, the labour market and the UK budget could all affect the BoE\u2019s future decisions. Key takeaways The market has already priced in a 25bps rate hike, but we don\u2019t expect the BoE to raise rates at its next meeting Brexit will be the biggest factor in what the BoE does: the UK economy could get a boost if pent-up demand resurfaces, but a hard Brexit could force the BoE to be more accommodative We don\u2019t expect major market moves from BoE\u2019s next quarterly inflation report, but we believe inflation will move steadily downwards in the coming months Any revisions to the BoE\u2019s labour-market outlook will likely happen next February, rather than in November In the last few months, the market concluded that the Bank of England will raise rates by 25 basis points by August 2019, and this rate rise was fully priced in. But we believe it\u2019s highly unlikely that it will happen at the BoE\u2019s next meeting on 1 November. The Brexit deal is the single most powerful determining factor for the Bank of England in whether or not it will change its monetary policy. Brexit may result in a boost to the UK economy if any pent-up investment demand resurfaces in 2019. However, a hard Brexit could prompt the BoE to cut interest rates and possibly even restart quantitative easing. Either way, the UK\u2019s central bank appears likely to remain a hostage to politics over the next few months. Inflation could be heading down The market is always on the alert when the BoE is set to release its quarterly inflation report, and the next one is timed for publication on 1 November. Investors will be watching for any revisions to the bank\u2019s inflation and growth outlook, but we don\u2019t expect significant market movements. For the last 10 to 15 years, UK inflation has been almost entirely driven by the British pound sterling\u2019s movements in the prior nine months. For example, inflation saw a huge jump in 2017 because sterling fell sharply after the June 2016 Brexit referendum. It takes a surprisingly long time for the inflationary effects of currency devaluation to come out of the year-on-year inflation numbers, but most of the 2016 declines in sterling have now disappeared from the inflation numbers. However, the pound actually appreciated in the last year, which means that inflation is likely to move steadily downwards over the coming months. After that, where inflation goes will depend on what Brexit deal is reached. Inflation should keep falling, although its future path depends upon sterling Source: Bloomberg and AllianzGI calculations. Data as at 30 Sept 2018. GBP NEER = British pound sterling calculated at the nominal effective exchange rate, year-on-year change, 6-month moving average, 9-months advanced. Watching the labour market Other factors are at play in the UK economy: wage growth is picking up, but the unemployment rate hasn\u2019t moved much lower. In addition, the Bank of England\u2019s annual productivity study surprised the markets in February because it suggested there was even less spare capacity in the labour market than previously thought. This is an added complication and reason to believe that inflation may trend slightly higher. Yet any major revisions to the BoE\u2019s outlook for the labour market will likely happen next February, rather than in November. An October budget deadline The UK\u2019s annual budget will also be presented to Parliament at the end of October, but it is unlikely that there will be a major increase in the projected deficit \u2013 at least not under this government. In fact, the government is projected to be a few billion pounds ahead of the budget it set out for this fiscal year. So if we were to see a slight increase in borrowing, it would be warranted by the better-than-expected revenues this year. Investing involves risk.

        "content": " For the ECB, a fine line between transparency and flexibility by Franck Dixmier | 19/10/2018 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Due to weak euro-zone inflation, we don\u2019t expect the ECB to change its monetary policy roadmap at its next meeting. Instead, the ECB is likely to keep its options open regarding its first rate hike by keeping its forward guidance vague, though its communications should become precise as we approach the summer of 2019. Key takeaways We don\u2019t expect any significant announcement at the ECB\u2019s 25 October meeting, but we do expect confirmation that the central bank\u2019s asset-purchase programme will wrap up by year-end September\u2019s one-year core inflation number was only 0.9%; this is reason enough for the ECB not to change its monetary policy roadmap Italy is certain to be discussed at the ECB\u2019s next meeting, because Italy\u2019s actions are bringing into question the rules that underpin the euro\u2019s credibility We do not expect the European Central Bank to take any decisions, or give further indications about its forward guidance, at its meeting on 25 October. The minutes of the ECB\u2019s last meeting, which were released on 11 October, reported that ECB members had discussed \u2013 for the first time \u2013 domestic cost pressures as a result of the euro-zone\u2019s high production capacity utilization rate, and the trend towards higher wages. However, we believe the weakness and stability of underlying inflation \u2013 which was 0.9% in September over one year \u2013 are reason enough for the ECB not to change its monetary policy roadmap. What we do expect is that the central bank will confirm the wrap-up of its asset-purchase programme by year-end. The ECB is also likely to remain vague on when it will raise interest rates, which would be the first hike since 2011. Faced with high expectations from the market, the central bank must arbitrate between transparency and flexibility. It is essential for the ECB to maintain enough leeway in today\u2019s environment, which is complicated by both diverging economic cycles and multiple risks to global growth and financial stability. So far, the ECB's diagnosis has been that the balance of risk in the euro zone remains neutral because growth is operating at a level beyond its potential, and is robust enough to offset the negative elements at work in the region. But it will be interesting to observe whether this view evolves during the ECB\u2019s 25 October meeting \u2013 especially given the risks posed by, among other issues, Italy\u2019s growing crisis. Italy presents a particularly crucial problem because its actions are bringing into question the rules underpinning the credibility of the euro itself. In this environment, we believe that the ECB's forward guidance regarding rate hikes will evolve pragmatically over the next few months, and will become more precise as we approach the summer of 2019.

        "content": " Outlook & commentary Equity market setbacks are normal by Neil Dwane | 17/10/2018 Summary The recent US equity market setback seems to be little more than a wobble. The global economy is not in recession, although it is slowing down, and monetary policy is still accommodative across the board. Nevertheless, this is cold comfort to investors who have become sensitive to even smallish corrections. Key takeaways Neither the US nor the global economy are close to recession: the Fed and other central banks are still accommodative, and financial conditions are still loose Longer-term Treasury yields are not at levels that should force asset allocation changes out of equities and into bonds Trade wars are painful, but they should not have a huge negative economic cost Quantitative tightening and rising US rates are supporting the US dollar, but it has risen only 7% this year Equity valuations are high, but shorter-term earnings growth is still strong A bullish stance would be supported by US Treasury yields stabilising at current levels (around 3.15%) A bearish view would see high-yield credit spreads start to widen from current levels Global equities in general \u2013 and US equities specifically \u2013 have been tearing upwards for the past decade with few serious setbacks. Cushioned by the super-palliative combination of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing (QE), investors moved away en masse from sovereign and investment-grade bonds towards high-yield bonds and equities. Yet recently, the global equity markets have experienced a series of stumbles that have unnerved investors a bit too much. Setbacks like these are arguably part of the normal process of markets \u2013 a way of clearing market excesses \u2013 but since the financial crisis, central banks have been loath to tolerate any loss of confidence in policy or in markets. Their supportive monetary policy has fostered a low-volatility, high-leverage, buy-the-dip mindset among investors, and a sense that central bankers have their backs. The upshot is a widespread sensitivity to even smallish corrections of 5% \u2013 such as the kind we\u2019ve recently seen. Admittedly, this jumpiness is mostly a US response; years ago, Europe endured its own euro-zone crisis while emerging markets were roiled with political and local issues. Nevertheless, the old adage still holds true: when the New York market sneezes, the world catches a cold. Significant market corrections in US history The brief list of equity market setbacks outlined in the accompanying table reveals a range of events, durations and magnitudes. It is also worth noting that the US fixed-income market hasn\u2019t had a proper setback since the savings-and-loan crisis of the early 1990s, and the debt and loan carnage of 2008-2009. As the same time, it is notable that nearly all of the triggers seen in the more substantial setbacks are in place today: fears abound over China, excessive fiscal stimulus, high oil prices, political uncertainty and overvaluations.

In reality, however, growth in US equities has been almost entirely driven by the tech, consumer discretionary and health-care sectors; most other US sectors were down by between 5% and 25% as at mid-October. The volatility shock of February unsettled investors around the world, yet a number of factors point to this recent bout of nerves as one that is \"made in America\u201d: A hawkish Fed. The US Federal Reserve remains increasingly hawkish on its interest-rate projections, with the economy at full employment, significant fiscal stimulus at work and consumer inflation emerging. Less liquidity. Accelerating quantitative tightening, combined with the new cash repatriation policy in the US, is beginning to impinge on global liquidity conditions for the US dollar. This, in turn, is placing pressure on weaker banking systems, overleveraged emerging-market borrowers and economies that are sensitive to high oil prices \u2013 including India and Indonesia. Peak earnings. Today\u2019s high earnings are matched by 2019 expectations for the US equity market, supported by President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts. Yet this may in fact herald \u201cpeak earnings\u201d for this cycle. Peak buy-backs. Uncertainty is being fuelled by the quarterly cessation of US corporate share buy-backs. These will reach a record level in 2018, totalling nearly USD 1 trillion this year \u2013 5% of US GDP \u2013 and nearly USD 5 trillion over the past five years. Buybacks on this scale have not been a factor in any other market. Trade troubles. An increasingly aggressive US trade policy is also redrawing the globalisation consensus of old. The US is looking to corral China and its economic policy as it begins to acknowledge China as a strategic competitor in tech and intellectual property. A late-cycle economy. We are late in what is already close to the longest economic cycle on record. The US economy may be burning bright thanks to President Trump\u2019s fiscal stimulus, but it could come down to earth with a bump at some point in the next year or so. All of these factors have been building for some time, affecting global investor sentiment while US investors have focused on the booming domestic situation. As such, it is possible that the latest market drop is simply the US catching up with global assets that already fell in 2018. Where do we go from here? It is worth remembering that the world is not in a recession, yet a host of factors point to a global economy that is going through some notable changes. China is slowing as it rebalances, and it is hoping to avoid a trade war \u2013 hence its conciliatory responses to President Trump so far. If China doesn\u2019t stay strong, Germany, Japan and others could see a slowdown in capital expenditures and investment, which is already coming under pressure from higher oil prices. Inflation is beginning to brew globally as output gaps close and consumer prices rise. This will be exacerbated by tariffs and the challenging global weather conditions of this past summer, which affected harvests and are likely to drive food-price inflation. During 2019, the European Central Bank will follow the path out of QE set by the Fed and the Bank of England, although this will be tempered by rates remaining super-stimulative. Despite all these factors, politics and policy will have the biggest impact on international investor confidence; Brexit, Italy, India and the Middle East are all capable of providing shocks. And depending upon what happens in November\u2019s US mid-term elections, investors will feel assuaged or need more clarity. For now, however, this US equity market setback seems to be little more than a wobble. Europe and China are at or near critical support levels, as the accompanying table shows, but we have not yet reached levels that should cause major technical concern for US investors. Overall, valuations will remain crucial to identifying attractive long-term returns. US equities do seem to be expensive, while Asian and European equities (politics notwithstanding) appear to offer better value, higher dividends and similar long-term growth prospects. As we get later in the economic cycle, particularly in the US, we expect equity volatility to remain elevated; in this environment, we prefer an active approach, which can help identify winners and losers and provide an extra layer of risk mitigation for portfolios.

Instead, the ECB is likely to keep its options open regarding its first rate hike by keeping its forward guidance vague, though its communications should become precise as we approach the summer of 2019. Key takeaways We don\u2019t expect any significant announcement at the ECB\u2019s 25 October meeting, but we do expect confirmation that the central bank\u2019s asset-purchase programme will wrap up by year-end September\u2019s one-year core inflation number was only 0.9%; this is reason enough for the ECB not to change its monetary policy roadmap Italy is certain to be discussed at the ECB\u2019s next meeting, because Italy\u2019s actions are bringing into question the rules that underpin the euro\u2019s credibility Load More "

        "content": " Booming US economy provides support for the Fed\u2019s approach by Franck Dixmier | 19/09/2018 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Each new report of strong US economic growth, as well as rising but under-control inflation, seems to validate the Fed\u2019s approach to normalising US monetary policy. But the central bank won\u2019t put rate hikes on autopilot next year; rather, it will keep monitoring inflation and risks from trade wars, Brexit and emerging markets. Key takeaways The Fed\u2019s gradual withdrawal of accommodation was once again supported by the latest US jobs data: strong payrolls, healthy wage growth and low unemployment Inflation moved higher in August, reaching 2.7%, but it hasn\u2019t spiked in a way that should affect the Fed\u2019s tightening plans We expect a 25 bps hike at the FOMC\u2019s next meeting, and one more after that before the end of the year \u2013 but it won\u2019t put rate hikes on autopilot in 2019 As the Fed inches closer to the neutral rate, it will keep monitoring risks to the US economy, including trade wars, Brexit, Italian politics and contagion in emerging markets Economic activity is booming in the US, and the Federal Reserve appears to be doing a continued good job of normalising monetary policy while keeping an eye on inflation. Although the August CPI report was slightly below expectations, the August employment report delivered a robust set of data points. US payrolls have been strong, wage growth is healthy at 2.9% and unemployment is at 3.9%. Even the U-6 report \u2013 the broadest measure of unemployment \u2013 fell in August to an impressive 17-year low. This convergence of economic activity clearly indicates a US economy that is rolling along. But while inflation is trending higher \u2013 reaching 2.7% in August \u2013 it is not spiking in a way that should send a warning signal to the Fed. As a result, we expect the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to announce a rate hike of 25 basis points after its 25-26 September meeting, while emphasising that continued monetary-policy normalisation is required. We anticipate one additional rate rise at the November or December meeting \u2013 for a total of four increases in 2018 \u2013 and two more in the first half of next year. But it is important to emphasize that the Fed won\u2019t put its rate-hike plans on autopilot. The FOMC will be pragmatic as it moves closer to the neutral rate \u2013 a rate that neither stimulates nor restrains economic growth. Estimates vary about what the right neutral rate is, but the president of the Dallas Fed, Robert Kaplan, says it is around 2.5%; other estimates place it around 3%. (The target range for the fed funds rate is currently 1.75%-2.00%.) Regardless, as the Fed inches closer to the neutral rate, we expect it to stay immune to political pressure as it assesses the path of inflation and its risks to US economic activity. At the same time, the Fed is well aware of the risks on the horizon \u2013 including escalating trade wars, a hard Brexit, contentious politics in Italy, contagion in emerging markets and deceleration in China. Overall, Fed policy is still accommodative while clearly not behind the curve, and the Fed appears to be raising rates at the appropriate rate to keep up with inflation. Keep in mind that the FOMC started to hike at the beginning of the current economic cycle, when we had no inflation, because it was confident that inflation would return. And the Fed was right.

The global economy is not in recession, although it is slowing down, and monetary policy is still accommodative across the board. Nevertheless, this is cold comfort to investors who have become sensitive to even smallish corrections. Key takeaways Neither the US nor the global economy are close to recession: the Fed and other central banks are still accommodative, and financial conditions are still loose Longer-term Treasury yields are not at levels that should force asset allocation changes out of equities and into bonds Trade wars are painful, but they should not have a huge negative economic cost Quantitative tightening and rising US rates are supporting the US dollar, but it has risen only 7% this year Equity valuations are high, but shorter-term earnings growth is still strong A bullish stance would be supported by US Treasury yields stabilising at current levels (around 3.15%) A bearish view would see high-yield credit spreads start to widen from current levels Load More "

        "content": " A confident ECB wants to keep its options open by Franck Dixmier | 11/09/2018 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary We don\u2019t expect much news from the communications surrounding the European Central Bank\u2019s next meeting. But we do expect them to balance expressions of confidence in the euro-zone economy with a cautious approach to rate hikes. Key takeaways The euro zone\u2019s economic environment is still robust and its growth outlook still strong \u2013 which should give the ECB confidence to end QE this year At its next meeting, the ECB probably won\u2019t commit to raising rates before summer 2019; policymakers want to keep an eye on upcoming data \u2013 particularly inflation Don\u2019t expect the ECB to discuss Italy or reinvesting QE proceeds; officials would rather keep their options open in today\u2019s tense geopolitical environment We don\u2019t anticipate any surprises from the European Central Bank\u2019s next meeting, on 13 September. The latest euro-zone figures are likely to support the central bank\u2019s view that the economic environment is still robust and that the region\u2019s growth outlook, while below its 2017 peak, is still strong. We therefore expect to hear an expression of renewed confidence from the ECB that it will end its asset-purchase programme by year-end. The ECB wants to establish a sure footing before entering the next phase of its monetary policy, which will be less accommodative. The ECB is also likely to confirm its cautious stance on raising interest rates by reiterating that its first key rate hike is unlikely to take place before summer 2019. This will give the ECB enough leeway to factor in upcoming economic data, including whether the euro-zone\u2019s inflation trajectory is converging towards the central bank\u2019s target of about 2%. With this in mind, Luis de Guindos, the ECB\u2019s vice-president, recalled during a recent speech that the central bank\u2019s governing council uses three criteria to assess inflation in the euro zone: convergence to 2%, confidence in the inflation trajectory and resilience in a post-quantitative-easing environment. This message is unlikely to be affected by recent developments, including headline inflation of 2% and core inflation of 1% in August. At the press conference after the ECB\u2019s meeting, we expect to hear questions about how the central bank intends to reinvest the proceeds from its maturing securities. Yet we would be surprised if officials provided any clarification at this stage, since it is in the ECB\u2019s best interest to keep all its options open in today\u2019s tense geopolitical environment. We would also be surprised if the ECB mentioned Italy in its communications, particularly the risks to euro-zone financial stability from a face-off on fiscal issues between Italian authorities and the European Commission. The draft Italian budget will not be released until late September, and it\u2019s hard to see how the ECB would comment on rumours, rather than awaiting the facts. Investing involves risk.

        "content": " Are European equities overlooked? by J\u00f6rg De Vries-Hippen | 06/09/2018 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Europe can\u2019t compete with the high-flying US tech sector, but perhaps that isn\u2019t a bad thing. Europe is a region with decent growth, strong macroeconomic data and many healthy companies trading at a discount \u2013 which makes the market\u2019s worries appear overdone. Key takeaways Unlike the US market, which is dominated by tech, Europe has more \u201cold\u201d businesses such as industrials or financials \u2013 and Europe is attractively priced What\u2019s to love about Europe? GDP growth remains above-potential at 2%, and unemployment keeps declining: the latest euro-zone numbers are the lowest since December 2008 As an active asset manager, we\u2019ve uncovered many European firms that are financially sound, have full order books and even complain about a lack of capacity Consider a dividend-focused, value-based approach to Europe: financials and energy look attractive European equity indices once again started to lag their US counterparts over the course of the summer, and investors have been steadily moving away from Europe for most of the year. Yet Europe is a region with solid growth, strong macroeconomic data and many healthy companies trading at a discount \u2013 which, in our view, makes worries about Europe appear overdone. Recently, investors have preferred the US over Europe in large part because of the high-flying dominance of the US tech sector. Tech constituted more than 25% of the overall US market on 12 June, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, while the euro-zone market had a tech component of just under 10%. Europe has more balanced sector exposure, with the largest representation by \u201cold\u201d business such as industrials or financials. But this is not necessarily a bad thing, particularly considering what happened during periods of excess sector concentration in the past \u2013 including the tech sector during the dot-com bubble, financials during the 2006 housing bubble and energy back in the 1970s. Moreover, some portfolio manager surveys show that the most overbought area of the market is US tech, while European financials are among the most oversold. So while Brexit continues to weigh on investors\u2019 minds, it may be time to take another look at Europe. Europe shouldn\u2019t be so unloved Investors generally have an extremely poor view of Europe. Its equity markets recently registered their 24th consecutive week of outflows, effectively removing all inflows seen over the course of 2017. However, although second-quarter economic growth hit a soft patch, primarily due to France and Italy, euro-zone GDP growth is expected to remain above-potential at around 2% this year. This should support local stock markets. In addition, the latest batch of macroeconomic data out of Europe contains many highlights: Industrial production and export activity have recovered from temporary low points. GDP growth in the UK recovered in the second quarter, supported by construction and industrial production. Unemployment continues to decline in the euro zone; the latest numbers are the lowest since December 2008. Overall employment is at a record high and wage growth has picked up notably; labour shortages can even be felt in the more buoyant countries, such as Germany. Despite a temporary GDP slowdown, unemployment is falling Source: Eurostat, AllianzGI Global Economics & Strategy. Data as at 31/7/2018. As a result, household consumption in the euro zone \u2013 which accounts for well above 50% of GDP \u2013 is set to remain a key driver of Europe\u2019s ongoing solid economic performance. Strong domestic demand has also shielded Europe from the impact of trade tensions so far. An active approach to investing in Europe Because Europe is a very open economy, the region and its stock markets get hit hard when investors worry about global trade or emerging-market issues. Yet some of the concerns around these issues appear overdone, with the market frequently deciding to shoot first and ask questions later. The Brexit vote on 23 June 2016 was a good example of this. After the initial panic and strong volatility, markets returned to focusing on the fundamentals, which were supportive. In fact, European markets have moved up more than 25% since the initial post-vote turmoil. As an active asset manager, we focus on the fundamental facts. Panic moments often lead to mistakes, costing real money. We take a more considered approach, starting with frequent interactions with European companies. We\u2019ve discovered numerous firms that are financially sound, have full order books and have even started to complain about a lack of capacity. This leads us to emphasise a dividend-focused, value-based approach to European equities. Yields in Europe are high, confirming the discount applied to European stocks. In our view, there is an undue neglect of companies with well-supported dividend payments. Moreover, modestly rising interest rates and a continued, gentle economic expansion make the value side of Europe appealing. Such an environment typically translates into better earnings \u2013 for example, for financials, many of which are strong dividend-payers. In addition, ongoing restructuring efforts by European energy companies can translate into strong cash generation and dividends. While large parts of the global stock markets trade on elevated valuations despite recent volatility, we believe Europe remains attractively priced. Investors should of course be prepared for even more noise and volatility in the run-up to the mid-term elections in the US. But buying good European companies at good prices may be able to shield investors from some of this impact. In a world driven by high-tech flash, consider using Europe's \u201csubstance and value\u201d to balance an otherwise growth- and tech-biased portfolio. Investing involves risk.

        "content": " Outlook & commentary Beware inflation, which lurks before it spikes by Neil Dwane | 05/09/2018 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Investors shouldn\u2019t get complacent about inflation: we may not see an early return to historic levels, but conditions are ripe for an unexpected rise. To fight the erosion of their purchasing power, investors should consider real assets \u2013 such as commodities and real estate \u2013 as well as equities and inflation-linked bonds. Key takeaways Inflation may be temporarily gone, but it should not be forgotten: oil prices, currency volatility and trade wars could force up inflation unexpectedly The combination of inflationary factors and disinflationary structural forces \u2013 ageing demographics, a shrinking workforce \u2013 raises the risk of a policy error by central banks When central banks see inflation, they will likely celebrate it rather than try to quash it like they did decades ago Rather than debate what inflation\u2019s true level is, or why it hasn\u2019t reverted to historical norms, investors should question their own inflation complacency Investors once knew to fear inflation, but it hasn\u2019t been much of a factor for almost four decades \u2013 neither in the global economy nor in many investors\u2019 strategies. This has led to a degree of happy complacency for consumers, who don\u2019t like inflation because it means higher prices, and for investors, who haven\u2019t felt the pressure to strive for higher real returns. At the same time, central banks generally seek to maintain a certain level of inflation to keep their economies growing; recently, 2% per year has been their target rate. Yet in the post-financial-crisis era, central bankers have essentially printed money through policies of low rates and quantitative easing, and inflation has barely budged. Working against inflation are certain disinflationary structural forces \u2013 such as ageing demographics and a shrinking global workforce \u2013 that show no signs of abating. Increased competition and the rise of the digital economy are also making it more difficult for companies to raise prices. These are worrisome developments that raise the risk of a policy error by central banks as they attempt to meet their inflation mandates. Why inflation could move higher Even though inflation may be temporarily gone, it should not be forgotten. We believe there are a range of reasons to expect that inflation could move higher unexpectedly: The price of oil appears likely to continue hovering near USD 75 per barrel, which could be inflationary. An oil shock from the Middle East could drive prices up even more. Diverging monetary policy among major central banks is causing currency-market volatility. For trade-reliant countries, weaker currencies mean import inflation, which can undermine real consumer spending and investment. As China reforms its state-owned enterprises and the country begins exporting for profit rather than employment, higher traded-goods prices could help exporters but hurt consumers. Trade wars will hopefully be short-lived, but friction between the US and China or others is likely to deliver a small increase to global inflation. Asset prices have been boosted by \u201ccheap\u201d money and plenty of leverage, but the real-estate market could also cause problems if purchase and rental prices keep rising, consumer spending falls and economic inequality grows worse. Businesses are faced with rising input costs from higher wages and increasingly expensive raw materials. Eventually, they may be forced to choose between lifting prices and reducing their margins. Central banks are taking different approaches to inflation The global economy made its way out of the 2007-2008 financial crisis by using record-low interest rates to pile on debt. A great deleveraging is overdue, yet much of the world\u2019s debt may not be reduced by the usual measures \u2013 repayment or default \u2013 but instead repaid with \u201cdefault by inflation\u201d. In this sense, central banks will likely celebrate inflation rather than try to quash it like they did decades ago. But since each economy faces a different set of threats and opportunities, investors should expect a variety of approaches from central banks managing diverging economies: United States. The already strong economy could get even hotter thanks to aggressive fiscal stimulus in the form of President Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms. This could overly tighten labour markets and cause a boom-then-bust cycle, revealing a Federal Reserve that hasn\u2019t raised rates quickly enough to keep up with inflation. Watch for the US dollar to move higher, and for a greater risk of higher wages, falling corporate margins and supply bottlenecks. United Kingdom. With the UK mired in Brexit, the weakness of the British pound has pushed up domestic inflation \u2013 and with 60% of consumption coming from imports, the UK is vulnerable to more inflation shocks as Brexit unfolds. This could squeeze real consumer spending and GDP growth. Europe. Excess production capacity, high unemployment and a strong euro have kept inflationary pressures low, and we don\u2019t expect this to change even if Italy and France kick-start their economies. China. Inflationary pressures have been modest as commodity prices stabilise and reforms in coal, power and steel work their way through the economy. Food prices are a political concern but have been contained for now, while a higher producer price index is supporting corporate profitability. Japan. Japan remains mired in a modestly deflationary environment as the ageing of its society continues. Any changes to the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy could leave the yen stronger and further contain inflation, even with higher oil and power prices. Emerging markets. The inflationary outlook for Asia and other emerging-market nations is benign. However, a rising US dollar and higher oil prices may again constrain consumer spending and some corporate pricing power.

What investors can do to fight inflation Given the relative lack of inflation in recent years, too many investors may be neglecting to protect their portfolios. This is a mistake, given that even relatively low levels of inflation can significantly erode purchasing power over time. To combat inflation, consider real assets like commodities and real estate, which have traditionally held their real value better than financial assets like bonds and cash: While property has always been a good hedge, it is expensive in many regions, reducing its usefulness unless held for many years. Infrastructure assets often provide the potential for attractive long-term returns, and they help institutional investors match long-term liabilities with long-term liabilities \u2013 albeit with now lower levels of yield. Gold can be a hedge against both inflation and policy errors by central banks. Aside from real assets, the two most common hedges against inflation are inflation-linked bonds (ILBs) and equities \u2013 though equities, like property, can be too volatile to be an effective inflation hedge in the short term.: ILBs are markedly less liquid than many other fixed-income securities, and they can be expensive because large institutional investors buy and hold them to match their long-term liabilities. What makes ILBs attractive is that they adjust for changing levels of inflation, offer much lower volatility and can provide a well-diversified global opportunity set \u2013 qualities that are particularly useful given the inability of many traditional fixed-income investments today to offer significant real returns. Protecting purchasing power is paramount Despite the debate about what inflation\u2019s true level is, or why it hasn\u2019t reverted to its historical norms, we believe the more important issue is investors who suffer from inflation complacency. Investors should aim to grow their wealth with the appropriate level of risk in a manner that protects their purchasing power against the longer-term threat of inflation \u2013 even at 2% levels. Sir John Templeton, one of history\u2019s best-known investors, said it best: \u201cInvest for maximum total real return. This means the return on invested dollars after taxes and after inflation. This is the only rational objective for most long-term investors. Any investment strategy that fails to recognize the insidious effect of taxes and inflation fails to recognize the true nature of the investment environment and thus is severely handicapped.\u201d Investments in commodities may be affected by overall market movements, changes in interest rates, and other factors such as weather, disease, embargoes and international economic and political developments. Inflation-linked bonds (ILBs) issued by a government are fixed-income securities whose principal value is periodically adjusted according to the rate of inflation; ILBs decline in value when real interest rates rise.

        "content": " Outlook & commentary To reduce inequality, focus on inclusive growth by Neil Dwane | 13/08/2018 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Burdened by too much debt and growing societal frustration, the global economy is faced with stark choices, including fiscal austerity and rising defaults. But what if we took a page out of Henry Ford\u2019s playbook, creating a highly paid, highly trained workforce to help usher in a new era of inclusive growth? Key takeaways Today\u2019s slow-growth environment is creating social problems, including resurgent populism and rising economic inequality An \u201cinclusive growth\u201d approach \u2013 which includes higher pay for workers \u2013 might turn around the global economy while reducing inequality As Henry Ford proved, higher pay can result in greater productivity, reduced turnover and higher profits \u2013 and it can help the middle class grow A better-trained, better-paid workforce can make business models more profitable and sustainable \u2013 and could usher in a longer-term return to widespread growth The global economy has been stuck in second gear since the financial crisis. Historically low interest rates and seemingly free-flowing credit have kept the economy from backsliding \u2013 and boosted corporate profits \u2013 but they have failed to reignite growth. Beyond the economic toll, we are seeing a host of social and political problems come to the fore, including a resurgence of populism and rising economic inequality. There are no easy solutions to these problems; multiple approaches will be needed to truly fix the global economy and address growing levels of societal frustration. But one such approach may be encouraging governments and corporations to deliver \u201cinclusive growth\u201d \u2013 growth that is shared throughout society in a way that reduces economic inequality. For an example of how this might work, consider the American automobile magnate Henry Ford. Although he is primarily remembered for his transformative success at using the assembly line to mass-produce the Model T, what is less widely known is how he used high wages to stabilise his workforce and improve productivity. As the Model T\u2019s popularity grew, Ford realised that chronic employee absenteeism and high turnover were hurting his bottom line, so he decided to pay his workers a wage so competitive that they would be unwilling to risk leaving or losing their jobs. Ford\u2019s strategy worked, and the payoff was significant: employee turnover decreased, workers became more skilled, production lines became increasingly efficient and profits soared. Beyond his factory walls, Ford\u2019s approach helped develop America\u2019s middle class, and helped create an economy that was increasingly driven by consumer demand. In contrast to Ford\u2019s approach, what seems to drive many corporate management teams today is the pursuit of short-term profits by cutting costs \u2013 particularly the cost of labour. And instead of making wise capital expenditures, many companies conduct share buybacks that inflate their stock options, even though buybacks can actually diminish medium-term returns by starving investments that boost competitiveness. All too often, these boosts to profits and stock prices come at the expense of employees, the environment and sometimes the quality of a company\u2019s products. To be sure, most companies exist to generate profits. But companies form part of the social and ethical structures of their societies, and the pursuit of profit should not be their only goal. Companies could be better off trying to make their business models more sustainable by managing long-term risks to their businesses, by focusing on productivity and innovation, and by finding ways to contribute to the societies they depend on for their prosperity. Learn more: read How to repair economic inequality and Let's resolve to build a new business model Higher wages are part of the inclusive growth approach that society needs, but simply boosting payrolls will not instantly repair decades of increasing inequality and failing economic growth. There are too many other economic pressures at work, including the rise of artificial intelligence and robotics; according to a survey by Oxford University, 47% of US jobs could soon be lost to computerisation. So if corporations want to make their business models profitable and sustainable, they should focus on raising the skill levels of their employees, not just pay levels. And if governments truly want to reduce some of the longer-lasting effects of inequality, they should implement policies that help workers evolve into new roles. There may be downsides to this inclusive-growth approach \u2013profits and investment performance may take a short-term hit \u2013 but the medium- to longer-term payoff could be a widespread return to growth. This is surely more in line with what society needs: a rising tide of economic prosperity that lifts all boats and carries us towards a more sustainable future. Paying down debt in a low-growth world Inclusive growth could be a more palatable solution to the slow-growth environment that is preventing economies from reducing their debt levels, especially since some of the alternatives are a lot less appetising: Enforced austerity. This approach would require economies to go on a severe diet by becoming more efficient and repaying excessive debts, without counting on debt forgiveness. This could foster more economic inequality and add to the appeal of populist politics. Debt default. This could deliver a devastating blow to the financial system and impose severe economic conditions for years to come, and it might transform the political system in untold ways. Just look at Argentina, which has yet to recover from a century of defaults. Default through inflation. This solution is arguably just as pernicious as direct default, since inflation hurts society\u2019s poorest citizens more than its richest. Many central banks have a target inflation rate of around 2% per year, but even relatively low levels of inflation can significantly erode purchasing power over time. Default through hyperinflation. History shows that this option causes not only economic collapse but also social collapse, as seen in the Weimar Republic of Germany in the 1920s and in Zimbabwe and Venezuela today.

In a late-cycle environment marked by the potential for tail risks, investors should take a closer look at small caps, energy, high yield and alternatives. Key takeaways Equities aren\u2019t the only US asset class performing well in 2018: the dollar, high-yield bonds, Treasuries and small caps have also been positive Trade tensions have increased global uncertainty, but we believe China isn\u2019t inclined to escalate matters or retaliate much further We see the potential for a strong year-end in the US; historically, the period after mid-term elections has been robust for the markets as uncertainty is lifted Looking ahead to 2019, tail risks could emerge; we encourage investors to remain diversified and active, and to consider increasing exposure to uncorrelated assets While volatility and global uncertainty were hallmarks of the first half of this year, we see three themes that could drive the last half of the year: trade tensions, mid-term elections and the Federal Reserve's ongoing normalisation. US markets set a steady pace Starting the second half of 2018, US risk assets, despite facing mediocre returns on an absolute basis, have demonstrated robust relative performance. The S&P 500 Index, one of the few global equity markets with returns in the green, was up 1.7% after the second quarter of 2018. (See Exhibit 1.) Exhibit 1. There\u2019s plenty of good in seeing green US equity market returns (year to date) have been robust relative to their global peers. Source: Bloomberg. As at 30 June 2018. And this resilience runs beyond equity markets: the US dollar has strengthened, US high-yield bonds have moved upward, US Treasuries are starting to reverse higher and, notably, US small caps, as represented by the Russell 2000 Index, are outperforming the S&P 500 by nearly 6% for the year. The positivity around US risk assets began as the global growth story faded somewhat earlier this year, particularly as economic momentum stalled in Europe and for some emerging-market countries. While economic momentum now seems to have stabilised abroad, escalating trade tensions have once again increased global uncertainty as markets in Asia decline on tariff and inflation fears. However, the US economy remains relatively closed, with 70% of GDP coming from consumption (and only 12% of GDP from exports), which continues to be a boon for US small-cap companies. In addition, as the Federal Reserve (Fed) confirmed its normalisation course, indicating four potential rate hikes in 20182 compared to a more gradual path reaffirmed by global central banks, risk assets like the US dollar continued to strengthen. (See Exhibit 2.) Exhibit 2. The greenback continues to build muscle The US dollar has been outperforming developed-market currencies, including the Chinese renminbi. Source: Bloomberg. As at 30 June 2018. As we enter the second half of 2018, we are now watching several key markets and events, and are particularly focused on three areas: Trade tensions remain a critical tail risk Trade tensions with China have escalated and continue to be a source of uncertainty for markets. While the implemented tariffs are, thus far, not economically significant (the USD 34 billion implemented on both sides as at 6 July amounts to less than 0.5% of either economy), the risk of escalation remains a looming unknown. If the US administration pursues close to USD 400 billion in tariffs, for example, China could retaliate, and perhaps use strategies beyond tariffs on US imports, which only amounted to USD 130 billion in 2017. While this is certainly a risk, we see the sell-off in Chinese equities, combined with recent statements from the Chinese government around intending to keep its currency stable, as indications that China does not prefer a trade escalation or other retaliatory measures. Mid-term elections could provide an inflection point As we continue through 2018, we see the US mid-term elections on 6 November as critical to the market path. Historically, the period before mid-term elections has been volatile for markets, and the period afterward has been robust, regardless of party winners, as marketplace uncertainty is lifted. We see the potential for a strong year-end in the markets as well, particularly as we would continue to gain clarity around policy and the current administration. Furthermore, sidelined bipartisan issues such as infrastructure reform could re-emerge as a focus area as we get closer to mid-term elections, which may also boost market sentiment. The Federal Reserve is on a normalisation path Even if we remove trade tensions and politics, one key driver of the US economy over the next 1-3 years remains: the Fed. The Federal Open Market Committee has been clear that it intends to continue its normalisation path, with its median \u201cdots\u201d now indicating four rate hikes in 2018, pushing the US economy toward a later-cycle stage. With the fed funds rate moving higher and the Fed balance sheet shrinking, the Fed is removing liquidity from the financial system; the implications for this include elevated volatility and limited multiple expansion in equity markets. In addition, we have seen the yield curve continue to flatten, approaching multi-year lows. (See Exhibit 3.) (Although our analysis shows that a flat or even inverted yield curve is not uncommon towards the end of a Fed tightening cycle.) And while the inversion of the yield curve is historically a recession indicator, we typically do not enter a recession until 6-18 months after inversion has occurred. Nonetheless we continue to monitor Fed movements and the downward trajectory of the yield curve as part of our in-house late cycle monitor. Exhibit 3. Is the yield curve riding down a one-way street? The yield-curve has moved in one direction over the past five years: down. Source: Bloomberg. As at July 2018. How the rest of the year may unfold Overall, we believe that the S&P 500 Index should offer positive returns for the year, albeit with more volatility and below the 20% return we saw in 2017. We continue to see this as a peak year in terms of the economy and earnings, with US GDP approaching 2.9% and S&P 500 earnings topping 20% in 2018. As a result, certain themes that have been working this year \u2013 small-cap stocks, energy and high yield \u2013 all could have legs, particularly as we approach a potentially robust year-end period. However, we remain more cautious as we head into 2019 and beyond, as we are clearly approaching a more late-cycle environment that is driven by the Fed and fraught with new and emerging tail risks. We encourage investors to remain diversified, active and consider increasing exposure to uncorrelated assets where possible. Four to watch Looking ahead, these opportunities could help power portfolios: US small caps may have legs This area of the market has had strong first-half performance, and we believe it continues to have potential as we round out the year, particularly if trade rhetoric remains ongoing, which seems likely over the near term. In addition, tax reform benefits should also lift small caps over the next several quarters. Energy can pick up late-cycle steam Historically, commodities tend to perform well in a late-cycle, above-potential growth environment. Given the positive supply-demand fundamentals of the energy sector, combined with the notable underperformance of energy stocks versus actual oil prices, investors could see continued outperformance in the sector. US high yield could offer more alpha The high-yield market, particularly lower-rated segments, has performed well during the first half of the year. Given that we do not see a recession or substantial default cycle on the horizon, higher-quality high yield could remain attractive this year considering the relative carry and still favourable technical outlook. High yield is also an area where investors may benefit from active management, given the idiosyncratic nature of the bonds and the attractive opportunity for out-of-index positions. Consider increased exposure to alternatives As we approach a late-cycle environment in the US, we continue to feel that investors could benefit from gradually increasing exposure to alternative assets, including private credit, infrastructure debt and equity, and absolute-return opportunities. These types of investments tend to be less correlated to equities over time, and thus provide an additional source of diversification and potential protection for a portfolio. Investing involves risk. The value of an investment and the income from it will fluctuate and investors may not get back the principal invested. Bond prices will normally decline as interest rates rise. The impact may be greater with longer-duration bonds. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.

But what if we took a page out of Henry Ford\u2019s playbook, creating a highly paid, highly trained workforce to help usher in a new era of inclusive growth? Key takeaways Today\u2019s slow-growth environment is creating social problems, including resurgent populism and rising economic inequality An \u201cinclusive growth\u201d approach \u2013 which includes higher pay for workers \u2013 might turn around the global economy while reducing inequality As Henry Ford proved, higher pay can result in greater productivity, reduced turnover and higher profits \u2013 and it can help the middle class grow A better-trained, better-paid workforce can make business models more profitable and sustainable \u2013 and could usher in a longer-term return to widespread growth Load More "

        "content": " Outlook & commentary Trump turns the tables on trade by Neil Dwane | 18/07/2018 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary As President Donald Trump ramps up the trade wars and retaliatory measures spread, investors are entering an unknown landscape \u2013 and no one knows what the US will do next. Yet given that trade makes up more than one-third of global GDP, it\u2019s critical to assess what we do and don\u2019t know about how the status quo could change. Key takeaways Trade is a winning political issue for President Trump; expect to see a steady flow of headlines in the run-up to the November mid-term elections China\u2019s newly restricted access to US technology has been a wake-up call, but it could also cause Asian nations to forge closer trading ties with China The trade wars could continue to spread: President Trump could direct his ire towards Germany, and negotiations between the UK and EU will likely not go smoothly With so much uncertainty around global trade, investors shouldn\u2019t be complacent: watch for currency volatility and keep an eye on shrinking corporate margins What will President Trump do next? In his words and deeds, President Donald Trump has been busy transforming the terms and tone of global trade. While he has been careful not to flout WTO rules too flagrantly, he has used the issue of national security to target what he considers the unfair trade practices of others. One of the reasons President Trump is focusing so intently on trade is that it appears to be a winning political issue. Trade-related issues poll well and the November US mid-term elections are approaching, so we expect to see a steady flow of trade-related headlines. That said, one challenge for the US president is that he may not be able to show enough progress on trade in time for the 2020 elections, particularly given that it has taken decades to build the status quo. When his administration renegotiates trade agreements, we expect them to be more often bilateral rather than multilateral. President Trump believes that by keeping trade agreements between two countries, he can win the largest discounts and most favourable terms for the US. He has also brought forth a new and rather extraordinary trade weapon: focusing on companies rather than just individuals or states. Given the potentially profound market implications, many corporations will be keen to avoid catching his attention. How will the US vs China battle shape up? We expect President Trump and his administration will continue concentrating their attention on China \u2013 in particular, the sharing of and access to US technology \u2013 as the trade war between the two countries continues to grow. Markets are laser-focused on the tension between the two largest economies in the world, particularly given the fact that they are led by two men who aren\u2019t known for backing down. This raises the risk of one or both sides making a serious error \u2013 with a USD 1 trillion trade relationship at stake. China will have a hard time addressing the enormous trade imbalance it has with the US. The US does not make much that it can sell to China \u2013 which is precisely the point President Trump is making about his country\u2019s large trade deficit. At the same time, the US\u2019s tough negotiating stance is hamstrung by the fact that China is fully integrated into the global supply chain of consumer and manufactured goods, of which the US consumer is the largest purchaser. As a result, President Trump will have to balance being aggressive towards China while not hurting the consumers who vote for him. For China \u2013 as well as Russia and a few others \u2013 President Trump\u2019s new focus on restricting access to US technology has been a wake-up call. Chinese firms may now need to develop their own operating systems and source code to reduce further risk to their businesses. With the tech sector representing over 30% of US and Asian benchmarks, this could be seriously disruptive. Suppliers in Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea could even need to choose which nation they will supply: the US or China. Could the trade war spread to the rest of the world? President Trump is of the view that the world has taken advantage of the US for many years. With China and Russia under fire, could he next train his crosshairs on Germany, another major exporter? Or could China, the European Union (EU), Canada and others band together, using the Trans-Pacific Partnership or another preferential trade agreement to lower tariffs for each other while excluding the US? These scenarios may sound far-fetched, but they are worth preparing for given their serious implications for investors. At the same time, Europe and the UK face their own trade war in Brexit, with no guarantee that negotiations will end smoothly. Brexit has the potential to disrupt the EU\u2019s economic engine, which would hurt Germany, as the world\u2019s largest exporter, as well as the UK, Europe's largest consumer. If the trade wars heat up, and retaliation rather than reciprocity becomes the order of the day, investors could face a host of new challenges. Retaliatory measures could be subject to the whims of politics, since industries, supply chains and consumers can be specifically targeted. Retaliation can also be difficult to price in and it can have the opposite effect. Consider autos and auto parts \u2013 the largest traded-goods sector, worth USD 1.3 trillion. Interference in the auto-supply chain may raise prices and reduce consumer demand, but it could also open up competitive opportunities along the supply chain. China could retaliate by selling some of its USD 3 trillion worth of US Treasuries or by steeply devaluing its currency. We consider both scenarios to be unlikely, since China's clear economic goal is to open up its markets and gain international credibility \u2013 plus where else could the country park 3 trillion US dollars? However, China is not without weapons: it could target large US corporations that do business in China, as it did with South Korea a few years ago. What should investors watch out for? 1. Prepare for the end of NAFTA President Trump has been ramping up tensions with Mexico, and it is entirely possible that the US could pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, particularly given the United States\u2019 push for new bilateral agreements that bring greater benefits to the US. An end to NAFTA would affect not just goods but services: financials, tech, banks and insurance companies could all be hurt. 2. Keep an eye on non-tariff barriers While news headlines are all about tariffs, the US and many other countries use other, non-tariff trade barriers to control foreign competition. For example, \u201crules of origin\u201d have become more elaborate to seek to address the effects of unfair trade competition. In fact, when subsidies and state aid are included alongside tax relief and industry bailouts over recent years, more than 55% of trade interventions are not tariff-related*. Investors should focus on these more granular details, which will affect corporate prospects. 3. Watch for currency volatility For decades, the US dollar has been the world\u2019s reserve currency, but a growing number of countries have sought to diversify away from the dollar standard \u2013 and this may accelerate as trade wars evolve through retaliation. This process would create currency volatility in countries moving away from the dollar, and it would also pressure the US to fund its own deficits though higher savings and investments. 4. Mind the margins Corporations around the world have been caught up in the trade-war maelstrom, and politics are winning over economic common sense. Margins could be affected as production is relocated away from the outsourcing partners that once made production cheaper and more efficient. Consider the global tech titans of the US: if they are no longer able to rely on labour and equipment from Asia, they may be forced to rebuild their manufacturing capabilities in the US or select from a dwindling list of allies. 5. Guard against complacency For some time, US enthusiasm about President Trump\u2019s tax cuts and deregulatory efforts has made markets complacent. So while the markets are nervous of the changes in trade, they seem to be counting on common sense to prevail, which is making them relaxed about the eventual outcome. This is already undermining corporations and investment. * Source: Global trade alert database, ifo Institute, AllianzGI Global Economics & Strategy. As of December 2017. Investing involves risk.

In a late-cycle environment marked by the potential for tail risks, investors should take a closer look at small caps, energy, high yield and alternatives. Key takeaways Equities aren\u2019t the only US asset class performing well in 2018: the dollar, high-yield bonds, Treasuries and small caps have also been positive Trade tensions have increased global uncertainty, but we believe China isn\u2019t inclined to escalate matters or retaliate much further We see the potential for a strong year-end in the US; historically, the period after mid-term elections has been robust for the markets as uncertainty is lifted Looking ahead to 2019, tail risks could emerge; we encourage investors to remain diversified and active, and to consider increasing exposure to uncorrelated assets Load More "

Take a closer look at this \u201cGoldilocks moment\u201d for insights into the cast of characters at play \u2013 and the surprises that may be in store. Key takeaways Goldilocks would find this global economy \u201cjust right\u201d for supporting today\u2019s equity valuations, credit spreads and volatility levels In our modern twist on the classic fairy tale, the Goldilocks economy has enjoyed a good post-crisis run in the Three Bears\u2019 house \u2013 but it\u2019s \u201cBaby Bear\u201d (Asia) who has the most attractive vision for the future No one knows how the global economy\u2019s Goldilocks story will end, but central banks\u2019 successful post-crisis policies have caused enough large-scale dissonance that this \u201cjust right\u201d moment probably won\u2019t last forever Our global economy is having a \u201cGoldilocks moment\u201d of sustained growth and low inflation: like the perfectly done porridge in the famous fairy tale, it\u2019s not too hot and not too cold. In fact, today\u2019s environment is \u201cjust right\u201d for supporting high equity valuations, tight credit spreads and generally low levels of volatility. But like many cautionary tales, this Goldilocks story may not end happily ever after. A modern cast of characters Thanks to the strong performance of financial markets since the financial crisis, our economic Goldilocks story features a family of Three Bears who have had quite a bullish run. Goldilocks. For years, the global economy benefited from the free-spirited monetary policy of central banks around the world, which have created a \u201cjust right\u201d environment. Financial repression has kept interest rates artificially low and asset classes artificially high. Papa Bear. The United States has the biggest, strongest economy around, but it may be top-heavy: for years, the US economy has been pumped up by low interest rates, excessive fiscal stimulus and unfunded borrowing. Mama Bear. The European Union\u2019s economy is closely tied to the United States\u2019, but it has its own personality and bad habits: negative interest rates and bank subsidies have kept zombie companies alive, and the EU has little appetite for real economic or fiscal reforms. Baby Bear. Asia\u2019s economy has long been the heir apparent to its Western relatives. Although Asia\u2019s markets aren\u2019t as mature, they are growing \u2013 and the region\u2019s work ethic is strong. With the right state reforms and long-term policies, she\u2019ll have a bright future. An uncertain setting In our adapted fairy tale, the economic Goldilocks has been enjoying a good run in the Three Bears' house since the financial crisis, living off their resources and enjoying their services. Yet eventually, she finds that the world she\u2019s thriving in isn\u2019t quite as warm and welcoming as she once thought. Goldilocks discovers that Papa Bear (the US) has grown a protectionist streak and is threatening to seal up his house \u2013 limiting the global trade that has been keeping everyone warm and well-fed. Mama Bear (the EU) is having an internal battle; parts of her want to stay, others want to leave and outsiders want to move in. Much of her time is spent trying to quiet her internal voices \u2013 Italy is currently expressing the loudest discontent \u2013 while getting along with her increasingly cross spouse. Baby Bear (Asia) has an attractive vision for the future \u2013 one built on nourishing growth, hard work and reform. Although she\u2019s still young, she hasn\u2019t yet inherited her parents\u2019 fondness for excessive consumption and borrowing. An unknown ending At some point, depending on the telling, the classic Goldilocks fairy tale ends up taking different turns: some versions show her getting frightened and running off into the woods; others find her being eaten by the Three Bears. Our global economy\u2019s fairy-tale moment is similarly uncertain \u2013 we don\u2019t know how, if or when this story will end. But we do know that central banks globally have abused the hospitality of economies and savers instead of forcing proper capital and market reallocations. This has caused dissonance and misallocations on a scale not seen since the global financial crisis. So while it\u2019s possible this Goldilocks moment will continue happily ever after, it\u2019s more likely the global economy won\u2019t stay \u201cjust right\u201d forever. Investing involves risk.

        "content": " Outlook & commentary How to repair economic inequality by Neil Dwane | 03/07/2018 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Wealth and income inequality are pressing global issues, affecting the quality of life for countless people, suppressing economic growth, stretching governments\u2019 capabilities and destabilising social systems. The good news? Politicians, corporations and investors can all do their part to enact change. Key takeaways Economic inequality may be at its highest level since the Industrial Revolution; in the US alone, the top 1% owned more than 38% of total wealth in 2016 The social safety net is weakening as more people can\u2019t afford basic living expenses, quality health care or retirement savings Those who invested in the financial markets in the last 10-40 years have done extremely well, but the many people who don\u2019t \u2013 or can\u2019t \u2013 invest in risk assets have fallen further behind Governments, corporations and investors all have roles to play in fixing the inequality problem. Allianz Global Investors constantly strives to add value beyond pure economic gain by aligning our interests with those of our clients and our communities. Even though extreme poverty has fallen in recent years, economic inequality has grown more pervasive. In addition to having a human cost, it drags down economic growth and destabilises social systems, and it stresses government spending and revenue streams. Yet while there\u2019s no easy fix, there are ways to narrow the inequality gap. Policy makers can focus on social safety nets, taxation structures and educational systems; corporations can boost training, compensation and sustainability efforts; and investors can promote responsible corporate governance. And we must make this a high-priority global effort: inequality is one of the most pressing social and economic issues the world faces today. How pervasive is economic inequality? While society has always had its share of haves and have nots, economic inequality \u2013 the uneven distribution of income and wealth \u2013 is arguably more widespread now than at any point since the Industrial Revolution. According to the United Nations, the top 1% of the US population owned more than 38% of the country\u2019s total wealth in 2016. But as the accompanying charts show, this is not just a US problem: economic inequality is rising worldwide, and the top 10% of populations are benefiting disproportionately. Income inequality is rising almost everywhere Income shares of the top 10% of populations (1980-2016) Source: World Inequality Database, World Inequality Report 2018. Data as at 2016. Wealth inequality is highest in the US Wealth shares of the top 10% of populations (2010) Source: OECD Wealth Distribution Database, Allianz Global Capital Markets & Thematic Research. Data as at 2010, except Chile (2011); Australia, Canada, UK (2012); Korea (2013). Multiple factors are driving inequality higher In recent years, globalisation has given rise to global manufacturing, enabling goods to be produced in low-cost centres and increasing the affordability of consumer products, including high-tech goods. But this shift of activities to developing nations has hollowed out industries in developed countries, including traditional big employers such as mining and steel. The rise of robotics, automation and artificial intelligence will also threaten conventional jobs in the future. Together, these and other developments have reduced the traditional work opportunities that once supported large segments of the population. This has made income and wealth inequality worse and created a growing opportunity gap \u2013 particularly for the next generation. Financial globalisation via the deregulation of financial markets has also played a role in making inequality worse by helping those who have wealth to increase it. Those who were able to invest in the financial markets since the 1980s have done extremely well \u2013 particularly in the last 10 years, thanks to central banks\u2019 extremely accommodative monetary policy pushing up asset prices across the board. By contrast, the large number of people who don\u2019t invest in risk assets have found themselves left increasingly farther behind. Enabling more people to participate in the \u201crisk premium\u201d of financial assets is clearly part of the solution. A clear and present danger While economic inequality may be rising, extreme poverty has dropped around the world. And it is fair to say that income inequality as a measurement tool doesn\u2019t always paint a full picture: a struggling nation can suffer from crippling poverty while being low on the income-inequality scale. In most countries, however, governments are paying close attention to economic inequality \u2013 just for different reasons: In the emerging world, where most wages are low, wealth inequality is the bigger issue. Not enough people own their own homes or have sufficient savings or pensions. In developed markets, a decreasing number of wealthy individuals shoulder more of the tax burden. Moreover, the social safety net is growing strained as ever-larger portions of the population are unable to afford basic living expenses, quality medical care and retirement savings \u2013 exacerbated by the rising, inflationary costs of health care. Worldwide, economic inequality is a destabilising force: it creates distrust and undermines cohesion, increasing the appeal of factional politics. Moreover, in a world of ultimate openness \u2013 aided by social media \u2013 people today are more aware of what they are \u201cmissing\u201d than were previous generations. This not only boosts populist politics, but it has a social cost: when people perceive they have fallen behind, they can be more stressed, grow less healthy and make riskier decisions as they try to catch up. How to repair economic inequality At Allianz Global Investors, we believe that all societal stakeholders \u2013 citizens and governments, investors and corporations \u2013 can play a role in addressing rising inequality even as we ensure that poverty levels continue to fall. To raise the level of personal savings and investment, governments should expand policies that educate their citizens about financial markets and encourage investment. The financial industry can improve financial inclusion by promoting wider access to financial services in a sustainable, responsible way. Financial literacy must be enhanced to enable larger portions of the population \u2013 particularly younger generations \u2013 to raise their economic standing. Regulation and tax reform need to become more fair and less politicized \u2013 and central banks must be allowed to focus on the longer-term interests of their economies, free of short-term political considerations. More-progressive tax policies can redistribute wealth in helpful ways, since lower-paid workers spend a greater proportion of their earnings than their higher-paid counterparts. Governments must improve the social safety net, using ubiquitous new technologies to make it more efficient, less prone to abuse and better at revenue collection. Education systems should be modernised to boost workers\u2019 skill sets, and student-loan systems may need to be overhauled, particularly if they reprice education in a way that benefits the supplier, not the student. Workforces need training, investment and support, and management teams should move into a more cooperative approach towards managing and retaining employees. Successful companies tend to pay more than less successful ones; better people and better remuneration deliver better productivity. With lower taxation and smarter regulation, financial services companies and banks should be able to reduce and better align their fees. This may help address accusations of profiteering. Investors can pressure management teams and boards to focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors \u2013 particularly executive pay \u2013 that can help reduce inequality. At Allianz Global Investors, we constantly work towards applying the power of active management to real-world issues \u2013 from the challenges and opportunities presented by robotics and artificial intelligence, to the perils of low productivity and rising economic inequality, to the ESG factors that help companies and shareholders succeed. As such, we will continue to strive to add value beyond pure economic gain by aligning our interests with those of our clients and our communities \u2013 directing capital into initiatives that are likely to promote future growth in a more sustainable and equitable way.

        "content": " Could the US dollar lose its reserve-currency status? by Karl Happe | 15/06/2018 Summary The US dollar has long been the currency of choice for banking and trade, and for valuing all other currencies. This has brought the US enormous economic benefits and significant structural downsides. Yet a shift away from the dollar may have begun, which could help the global economy in the long run. Key takeaways In years past, the denarii, ducat, guilder and pound each took a turn as the world\u2019s reserve currency. Today, it\u2019s the US dollar. Will the euro, renminbi or yen be next? Central banks hold fewer US dollars than they did in 2004, and fewer international payments are being settled in dollars If the dollar were to eventually lose its reserve status, its exchange rate could fall, US interest rates could suffer, and US equities and fixed income could potentially underperform What would happen if the world stopped depending on the US dollar? There is growing evidence that after years of dominance, the dollar could be losing its status as the world\u2019s reserve currency. Yet while a passing of the mantle could be painful for the United States, a more balanced reserve system \u2013 one that relies more on the euro, renminbi or yen \u2013 would likely help the global economy in the end. Why do reserve currencies exist? Throughout history, international traders and bankers have typically used one country\u2019s currency as a default base of exchange. Over time, the Roman denarii, Venetian ducat and Dutch guilder each took its turn as the commonly accepted medium for trade, and as the basis for valuing all other currencies. The British pound sterling was the currency of choice for international trade and value preservation from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th, when two World Wars and a Great Depression took their toll. Then sterling\u2019s success story became a cautionary tale. Its share of currency reserves among international central banks fell from around 60% in the early 1950s to less than 5% by the mid-1970s, and its value fell from more than USD 4 per pound at the end of WWII to near-parity with the US dollar in the mid-1980s. With the US dominating international politics during the post-War period, the dollar soon took the place of the pound and became the world\u2019s reserve currency. This brought the US both enormous economic benefits and significant structural downsides: For decades, the US dollar has stayed relatively strong versus other currencies as investors have pushed up its value. Doing cross-border business has been easy for the US, given that effectively all major commodities are traded and settled in dollars. On the downside, the US has been forced to maintain a permanent current-account deficit \u2013 in this case, a massive trade deficit funded by selling its government bonds abroad \u2013 to maintain its reserve-currency status. Although this trade deficit has enabled US citizens to consume more than they produce, it has also placed downward pressure on US wages \u2013 particularly for people manufacturing tradable goods. The dollar\u2019s decline may have already begun For a brief time around the turn of the millennium, there was some speculation about whether the euro would supplant the US dollar as the world\u2019s dominant reserve currency. Yet since then, there has been little movement on this front as the global financial crisis and European debt crisis seemed to curb the world\u2019s appetite for anything but the dollar\u2019s relative safety. In recent years, however, certain political events \u2013 such as the Brexit vote and the election of US President Donald Trump \u2013 have brought the dollar\u2019s dominance back into focus. Many non-Americans have begun to notice how exposed they are to the protectionist US political activity that has been roiling global markets. But this trend away from the US dollar predates the election of President Trump. As the accompanying charts show, central-bank reserves now hold fewer dollars than they did in 2004. Moreover, fewer SWIFT payments \u2013 the primary exchange for interbank fund transfers \u2013 are being done in dollars today than in 2015. (The euro is by far the next biggest currency for SWIFT payments in terms of overall volume, but there has been a shift to other currencies as well.) Other currencies are gaining on the US dollar World currency composition of official foreign-exchange reserves since 2004 Source: IMF. Data as at 31 December 2017. Chart shows world currency composition adjusted at average exchange rates, indexed to 100. \u201cOther\u201d currencies include RMB, JPY, GBP, AUD, CAD, etc. Would the world be better off without \u201cKing Dollar\u201d? Many market-watchers believe it would be better for the global economy to have a more balanced international reserve system that relies less on any single currency. But the process of getting to this point would be a bumpy one, and it would have significant implications for both exchange rates and the cost of capital in different economies. For the US, giving up reserve-currency status may help the country balance its trade relationships, but it would likely hurt the value of the dollar and create inflationary pressure on the prices of consumer goods. Ultimately, the United States\u2019 loss of reserve-currency status may only limit any further decline in wages, and there is a good chance it would also make US consumers a lot poorer. For other countries or regions \u2013 perhaps the euro zone, China or Japan \u2013 increased usage of their currencies would likely make their currencies stronger. This would improve their purchasing power for commodities and tradable goods, and it would lower the cost of capital for their domestic industries. However, these economies might also suffer further income disparity, since stronger currencies make unskilled labour pools less competitive. Fewer payment are being made in dollars Currency shares of SWIFT payments since December 2014 Source: SWIFT watch. Data as at 28 Feb 2018. SWIFT = Society for Worldwide InterBank Financial Telecommunications. Investment implications of a shift away from the dollar In the end, a country that boasts the world\u2019s reserve currency will generally feel the positives more than the negatives. As a result, if the US dollar were to lose its reserve status, investors should anticipate a drop in the dollar\u2019s exchange rate, a negative effect on US interest rates, and potential underperformance for US equities and fixed income. On the flip side, any currency that replaces the US dollar would likely pass along the benefits of lower capital costs and higher purchasing power to its issuing nation. Just as a shift to the euro as reserve currency might give the euro zone a relative growth boost, a move toward the renminbi or yen would likely also help China or Japan. As a result, we will be closely watching the statistics on reserves and international settlement to see if the initial trends away from the US dollar continue. Perhaps it\u2019s only a matter of time until the dollar goes the way of the denarii, ducat, guilder and pound \u2013 and one or more upstarts rise to take its place. Investing involves risk.

The good news? Politicians, corporations and investors can all do their part to enact change. Key takeaways Economic inequality may be at its highest level since the Industrial Revolution; in the US alone, the top 1% owned more than 38% of total wealth in 2016 The social safety net is weakening as more people can\u2019t afford basic living expenses, quality health care or retirement savings Those who invested in the financial markets in the last 10-40 years have done extremely well, but the many people who don\u2019t \u2013 or can\u2019t \u2013 invest in risk assets have fallen further behind Governments, corporations and investors all have roles to play in fixing the inequality problem.

        "content": " Outlook & commentary A region on the rise: key conclusions from our Asia Conference by Neil Dwane | 04/06/2018 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary Our clients and investment professionals recently met in Berlin for our 10th annual Asia Conference. Here are some of the highlights from two days of discussions about the world\u2019s most dynamic region. Key takeaways Standards for corporate governance and behaviour are rising rapidly across Asia amid a greater focus on ESG factors For investors, Asian politics are less worrisome than US or European politics; Brexit negotiations and Italy\u2019s discontent with the EU may be more pressing Global trade is still important to Asia, but as every year passes, the region\u2019s growth becomes more and more self-sustained \u2013 especially with \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d projects Built on strong long-term fundamentals, Asian equities and bonds offer investors the potential for solid returns and risk diversification ESG investing is on the rise While Asia once lagged Europe in many environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, an increasing number of governments and corporations in Asia are paying close attention to ESG factors. We expect this shift will gain momentum as the region\u2019s markets continue to develop. In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s government and major pension funds are pressing for improved diversity, shareholder representation and management accountability. China is changing its \u201cgrowth at any cost\u201d model of the last 25 years; President Xi Jinping knows the importance of delivering better living standards and a cleaner environment. South Korea is also making progress on its ESG journey, making efforts to address all-too-common management scandals and bribery issues. India still relies on domestic coal but is keenly aware of the unpopular costs of growth at the expense of the environment, particularly given the country\u2019s large farming population. Politicians are driving significant reforms Politicians know that the best way to get and stay popular is through sustained economic growth. Many Asian governments are focused on adapting their economic business models. They recognise that supplying goods to tapped-out US and European consumers will not work for much longer. China is leading the region\u2019s reform efforts, aiming to rebalance its economy away from exports and manufacturing towards consumption and services. Indeed, China\u2019s spending on consumer needs and essentials is already falling, leaving more room for discretionary spending. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is moving his country forward along similar lines, restructuring the country\u2019s banks and inefficient monetary system through an aggressive \u201cdemonetisation\u201d plan. A better biometric-based identification system called Aadhaar should make government services, such as welfare, more targeted and less susceptible to fraud. With general elections due in 2019, India does, however, face significant electoral unknowns. But greater political uncertainty exists in the European Union, which is grappling with Brexit and with Italy\u2019s threats to flout the EU\u2019s rules \u2013 or even withdraw from the monetary union. Trade troubles won\u2019t derail Asia\u2019s high-tech shift In recent months, trade friction between Asia and the United States created a steady flow of worrisome headlines for good reason. Trade wars help no one, particularly big exporters such as Japan, China and South Korea. Although US President Donald Trump seems to have softened his initially hard-line stance towards China, it is unclear whether new tariffs are officially off the table \u2013 particularly with regard to technology. Asia\u2019s regionally efficient supply chains mean the negative effects of tariffs can quickly spread; consider how the technology sectors in the US and China are inextricably linked with South Korea, Taiwan and other countries. Yet Asia\u2019s tech sector is on a good trajectory. At some point in the next few years, Asia appears set to become the largest investor in research and development (R&D) globally, intensifying a high-tech race with the US. Moreover, denying Asia\u2019s economies access to US technology could simply fuel the need for local Asian tech. Green tech and infrastructure are spurring development As Asian economies grow, they will come under the same pressure as their US and European counterparts to make that growth sustainable from an environmental perspective. The good news is that many leading economies \u2013 in Asia and elsewhere \u2013 may now be able to grow even as they decrease the negative environmental impact of that growth. China is leading the way with a strong emphasis on developing green technologies such as solar power and electric vehicles, as well as sustainable food sources through better R&D and agricultural practices. Infrastructure is also a major development theme for the region. India, Vietnam and Indonesia are addressing their huge infrastructure deficits in the hopes of sustaining strong, open and competitive economies. Asia as a whole is also supported by China\u2019s huge \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d plan, which is primarily an infrastructure project but could have a halo effect on employment and services development \u2013 particularly in Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Pakistan and Bangladesh. China is opening up its equity markets China has been taking measured steps to open up its currency, bond and equity markets to international investors even as it carefully controls the flight of capital out of the country. Yet despite an abundance of caution, China\u2019s market reforms are working well \u2013 and being expanded. This is turning Chinese equities from an asset class that many investors ignored into one that is being taken seriously, particularly with China A-shares set to be included in the MSCI Emerging Market index this summer. (For more insights into China, read \u201cWill the \u201cYear of the Pig\u201d be a prosperous one for China?\u201d and \u201c10 key facts about China A-shares\u201d.) Growth and income are top investment themes Asia\u2019s compelling structural growth story provides investors with a host of access points: Asia\u2019s millennials are reshaping their economies and driving the adoption of new technologies and services. Asia\u2019s focus on R&D is also giving the US a run for its money with big data and artificial intelligence. The prospect of less trade with the US and Europe could push Asian companies to focus more on the new emerging-markets consumer, many of whom may at first only be able to afford regional brands rather than those of global multinationals. Equity investors will find that many Asian companies boast less debt and better longer-term fundamentals than their Western counterparts \u2013 in addition to solid earnings and dividend growth potential. For fixed-income investors, Asia also offers the ability to boost return potential and diversification \u2013 particularly for portfolios overexposed to US high yield or overly sensitive to Federal Reserve policy. Thanks to its growing markets and rising domestic investment by local investors, Asia should be whipsawed less by US investors in years to come. Instead, the region will be powered by sound economic policy, strong fundamentals and exciting investment opportunities from both equities and bonds. Investing involves risk.

        "content": " Should you \u201csell in May and go away\u201d? 28/05/2018 Summary Market indicators point to a more supportive environment for investors who once may have been swayed by the seasonal \u201csell-in-May\u201d strategy. Here are five ways to potentially benefit from today\u2019s climate of strong fundamentals, healthy earnings growth and accommodative monetary policy. Key takeaways Despite a hard start, the year is looking up: our research shows that previous sell-in-May periods that followed a weak first quarter were actually largely positive for stocks We believe a US recession is unlikely in the next 12 months; from an economic and earnings perspective, this could be a peak year Mid-term election years in the US have historically caused volatility before November, but they also tend to end on a strong note as uncertainty is removed from the marketplace Five themes to watch: growth stocks could continue outperforming; a shift to value may happen suddenly; small-cap stocks have been making a comeback; high yield looks attractive; alts can help diversification With rising interest rates, slowing global growth and geopolitical tensions emerging from Iran, North Korea and China, investors may be tempted to adhere to the old trading adage, \u201csell in May and go away\u201d. But is this the right strategy for 2018? Past returns have paled Historically there is precedent to support the sell-in-May strategy known to influence investors. Since 1971, 70% of returns for the S&P 500 Index from the seasonal May-to-October period have been anemic, -0.37% versus 11.1% in the remaining six months of the year. (See Chart 1.) Chart 1: Sell-in-May months are often spiritless Average return pattern for the S&P 500 Index (1971-2017) Source: FactSet (1970-2017). Data are as at December 2017. 70% of years where sell-in-May in effect. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Sell-in-May months may shine However, investors who generally follow seasonal patterns should think twice this year: markets have already experienced high volatility in the first quarter, and the S&P 500 Index ended the period slightly down (-1.2%). Our analysis shows that there have been eight instances since 1990 where the first quarter of the year had negative average monthly returns for the S&P 500 Index. What has happened subsequent to a weak first quarter for the sell-in-May periods? Well, in five of the eight instances, the S&P 500 Index returned positive average monthly results in the May-to-October time frame. And the three periods that had negative returns were during recessions (1990, 2001 and 2008). Thus, given the negative first three months of the year, the data seem to be more in favor of an accommodative six months ahead \u2013 good news for investors. 2018 could be a peak year More broadly, our view remains that a recession in the US in the next 12 months is unlikely. From an economic and earnings perspective, we continue to see potential peak years, with the S&P 500 Index earnings growth on track for 18%-20% in 2018 and real GDP growth forecasted to approach 2.8%. (See Chart 2.) Chart 2: Despite a hard start, the year is looking up Consensus GDP growth points to 2018 as a peak year Source: Bloomberg Consensus. Data are as at April 2018. And while 10-year Treasury yields hover around 3.0%, we have also seen more recently inflation and wage growth that are softer than expectations. This sets us up for a supportive market environment for the remainder of the year. US markets will likely have to climb the walls of worry around slowing global growth, and rising tension around Iran, North Korea and China. Furthermore, mid-term election years, while certainly causing some volatility prior to November, tend to end on a strong note, as some uncertainty is removed from the marketplace. (See Chart 3.) Chart 3: Elections can lift the veil of market uncertainty S&P 500 Index performance during mid-term election years Source: Bloomberg. Calculations are for 6 month periods following the date, Jan 1950-April 2017. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Five to Watch Looking ahead, we continue to see key themes powering the markets: Growth positioned to outperform: This year, growth has continued to outperform value, with technology and consumer discretionary stocks showing leadership, despite bouts of volatility. In a late-cycle, potentially inflationary environment, this trend may continue. Our conviction lies with the long-term theme of \u201cwinners from disruption\u201d, particularly in the technology and retail space. Value may have its moment: We do believe at some point over this cycle certain value sectors will show signs of market leadership; this can happen swiftly and investors should be positioned accordingly. We have already seen the energy sector show strength, given the sharp rise in oil prices; we also believe financials and certain industrial sectors can do well in this environment benefiting from tailwinds. It remains early yet for a rotation into highly defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities as signs of recession in the US remain muted. Small cap\u2019s comeback: With rising trade tensions and uncertainty around global growth, it is interesting to see small-cap companies, which tend to be domestically oriented, making a comeback. The small caps have outperformed large caps by 2.2% and are prime candidates for active fundamental investors. (The S&P Small Cap 600 Index is up 1.2% year-to-date as of April 30, 2018, while the S&P 500 Index returned -1.0% over the same period.) High yield is a bright spot: Within fixed income, we continue to favor shorter duration strategies, and given we do not see a rise in defaults on the horizon, higher yielding fixed income continues to remain attractive. Stay diversified and somewhat defensive: Rather than \u201csell in May and go away,\u201d perhaps the adage should be \u201cdiversify in May and sleep better at night.\u201d Remaining diversified, not only by asset class and sector, but also with some exposure to commodities, makes sense particularly in a later cycle market with shifting market leadership. As noted above, while we don\u2019t see a turn in the cycle in the next 12 months, as we get later in the cycle, adding alternative assets to a portfolio such as private credit, infrastructure and real estate may make sense.

More regulation and taxation are almost certainly on the horizon amid growing concerns about privacy, governance and profitability. Key takeaways Governance and transparency issues were always going to catch up with the FANGs, but the reckoning has accelerated with new revelations about their use of customer data With politicians, regulators and consumers taking a closer look at how Big Tech does business, the need for better corporate governance is becoming clear FANG stock prices are falling as interest rates rise. Will the rising cost of capital hurt these massive but young corporations, or will they somehow adapt? Because China\u2019s high-tech BATs have closer government ties than their US counterparts, new regulations may not hurt the BATs as much as the FANGs FANGs face more bad news Just as the technology, media and telecom convergence inflated the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2013 the FANGs \u2013 accelerated the most recent run-up in US equities. But lately, not all has been fine for the FANGs. Their stocks have led the stockmarket\u2019s recent sell-off, losing 11 per cent on average during the last 11 trading days in March, according to Bloomberg. FANGs slid sharply after ides of March Price movements 15-29 March 2018, indexed to 100 Source: Bloomberg. Data as at 29 March 2018 (markets were closed on 30 March). Hand-in-hand with their declining valuations, their public perceptions are also taking a hit: Facebook is being criticized for how it uses private data, as evidenced by the growing scrutiny on Cambridge Analytica. Amazon\u2019s success has been tied to a hollowed-out US jobs market, and President Donald Trump has singled out the firm with strongly worded tweets. Google\u2019s near-monopoly status has drawn the ire of many politicians and pundits; together with Facebook and others, the firm is also grappling with accusations of abetting election interference and terrorism. Although the FANGs have different business models, they face similar questions about their social impact and value \u2013 and they\u2019re feeling pressure from governments, regulators and users. We outlined many of the pitfalls the FANGs face, including increased regulation and greater taxation, in a 2017 article entitled \u201cDe-FANGed: 5 Ways the Disruptors Could Be Disrupted\u201d. Unfortunately, more bad news may be in store for the FANGs and their peers. Four more forces fighting the FANGs Greater consumer-privacy protections In recent years, billions of consumers have come to enjoy \u2013 and even rely on \u2013 the \u201cfree\u201d digital services that companies like Facebook and Google provide. Yet recent scandals over privacy are causing a growing number of people to realize what Apple CEO Tim Cook once said best: \u201cwhen an online service is free, you\u2019re not the customer ... you\u2019re the product\u201d. To be fair, not all users want to opt out of the ads and services that FANG-type firms sell; in fact, some simply don\u2019t care how their digital information is used. Others may be concerned, but ultimately unable or unwilling to pay for a service like Facebook\u2019s should it change its advertising-supported business model. As the fight continues over the monetization of private information, the European Union will soon step into the ring with its new General Data Protection Regulation \u2013 a robust set of requirements aimed at guarding the personal information of all EU citizens. Launching in May 2018, GDPR will raise the costs of mining and disseminating digital data, which could affect the bottom line of any firm doing business in the EU. That includes the FANGs. With privacy concerns increasingly making headlines, we expect more jurisdictions to put an emphasis on personal privacy instead of taking a laissez-faire approach. If this movement spreads to society at large, perhaps the social propriety of social media could be called into question. Even if the #deletefacebook movement ultimately loses steam, the customer is always right \u2013 and votes with his or her feet. Calls for better corporate governance Before recent revelations about alleged election interference, much of the wariness about social media was limited to non-millennial generations. But today, consumer angst seems tangible and rising, and attention is turning to the corporate-governance structures \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 that permitted what many consider to be the systematic abuse of society\u2019s data and trust. Arguably, the governance of some of the FANGs and their brethren has rested with young billionaires and boards with little real-world expertise, let alone a desire to exercise restraint. One clear result has been their weak management of the mounting crises, which seems likely to alienate both users and advertisers in a self-reinforcing fashion. Moreover, one key avenue of recourse \u2013 pressure from shareholders \u2013 could be less than effective on FANG firms due to the dual-class share structure that gives their founders outsize control. A changing investment environment During the pronounced equity market run-up of recent years, some FANGs offered rising earnings to go with their soaring share prices \u2013 a factor that was generally absent during the dot-com days. Yet the business models of many of today\u2019s Big Tech giants may rely less on profitability than on access to cheap credit \u2013 an unintended consequence of the extremely accommodative monetary policies set by central banks in recent years. With higher rates on the horizon, easy money will be harder to get. This raises a key question: if the rising cost of capital imperils tech firms that are actually running at a loss, can the disrupters continue to disrupt? Could we see some of the world\u2019s largest corporations \u2013 some less than 20 years old \u2013 fall to Darwinian forces as they fail to adapt? A backlash against monopolist models Governments have been known to help give birth to monopolies they then spend decades trying to control \u2013 and the FANGs and their ilk may find themselves on the receiving end of similar efforts. Politicians and regulators know that economies need a regular supply of efficient competition to promote innovation and productivity, but that supply is stifled by the \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d effect at work today. Adding to the monopoly accusations plaguing Google, Amazon has a model that is equally problematic for its competitors. Going head-to-head against such a company \u2013 which offers consumers a single marketplace with renowned services and efficiencies \u2013 becomes all but impossible when it is under little pressure to make a profit, which is normally what a free-market economy would demand. Pride comes before the fall FANG-type firms have re-energized the consumer experience across the developed world, but at what cost? The rise of e-commerce is hollowing out shopping malls and main streets, displacing many employees who once worked there. To be sure, the business models of the FANG family may be too popular not to endure, but they have begun to see their share of trust damaged. All companies form part of the social and ethical structures of their societies, and the pursuit of profit is only one goal. Ironically, while the FANGs are increasingly seen as a hindrance to democracy and fair competition, their Chinese equivalents \u2013 Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, also known as the BATs \u2013 seem to be more willing, more able or more compelled to align themselves with their own government. The BATs are also viewed less as troublemakers than as modernizers of the emerging markets, feeding the needs of consumers who want to shop, communicate and be entertained on their smartphones. Setting aside the FANGs\u2019 public perception problems, two particular numbers underscore the investment case for BATs: the BATs will ultimately be able to access over 4 billion consumers across Asia, while the home market for the FANGs is less than 750 million.

Here are five ways to potentially benefit from today\u2019s climate of strong fundamentals, healthy earnings growth and accommodative monetary policy. Key takeaways Despite a hard start, the year is looking up: our research shows that previous sell-in-May periods that followed a weak first quarter were actually largely positive for stocks We believe a US recession is unlikely in the next 12 months; from an economic and earnings perspective, this could be a peak year Mid-term election years in the US have historically caused volatility before November, but they also tend to end on a strong note as uncertainty is removed from the marketplace Five themes to watch: growth stocks could continue outperforming; a shift to value may happen suddenly; small-cap stocks have been making a comeback; high yield looks attractive; alts can help diversification Load More "

        "content": " Outlook & commentary What\u2019s fuelling the growing appetite for Asian bonds by Neil Dwane | 20/03/2018 Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on facebook Share via email Summary To move past the financial crisis of the 1990s, Asian economies made a host of important structural changes \u2013 and Asian fixed income stands ready is positioned to benefit. Not only is there growing demand for Asian bonds from Asian investors, but outside investors are looking to the asset class \u2013 particularly sovereign debt \u2013 for its potential to enhance returns and reduce risk. Key takeaways Asia has learned much from its mistakes in the 1990s \u2013 in particular, the dangers of fixed exchange rates and over-reliance on international capital flows For the last 20 years, Asia has been laying good foundations, tightening regulations and implementing a stronger institutional framework to prepare for its re-emergence Capital from Asian savers is likely to be increasingly deployed within Asia, lessening reliance on a volatile, overvalued US dollar Asian bonds offer the potential to improve returns and reduce risk \u2013 particularly via long-term opportunities linked to strong growth potential, current account surpluses and healthy foreign-exchange reserves As the global \u201chunt for income\u201d continues, Asian bonds are an essential part of the investment solution A series of sweeping changes show Asia has learned from the past The financial crisis that affected Asia in the 1990s scarred both the region and its governments, prompting politicians and policymakers to learn from their mistakes. With structural reforms, tighter regulations and improved capital requirements, their efforts have paid off, and it is becoming abundantly clear that Asia\u2019s economy looks very different than it did just 20 years ago. This is having a profoundly positive impact on the outlook for Asian fixed income. Demographic challenges are leading to rebalancing and reform Governments across Asia are starting to focus on building more sustainable structural growth by encouraging economic \u201crebalancing\u201d and improving household incomes; China in particular has embarked upon a significant long-term rebalancing project, led by President Xi Jinping. The upshot of these efforts is that Asia and other parts of the world are no longer able to depend on China\u2019s explosive economic growth and hunger for commodities, nor on its seemingly limitless supply of low-cost labour. Instead, regional stability will depend on China\u2019s success at reducing systemic risks to its financial system \u2013 which it aims to accomplish primarily by controlling the pace of credit expansion (see Figure 1) and by gradually deleveraging its state-owned enterprises, or SOEs. Figure 1: China\u2019s pace of credit expansion has slowed, but deleveraging takes time Total social debt as a % of GDP; 2007 to Q3 2017 Source: JPMorgan, Allianz Global Investors. Data as at June 2017. However, China\u2019s vital SOE reforms do not mean privatization. Instead, China is moving towards greater control of key industries while encouraging more regional competition in non-strategic areas \u2013 like services, consumption and technology. As a result, additional economic changes are being felt across the region. South Korea is becoming a world leader in cosmetics, cosmetic surgery and technology Thailand is gaining ground in tourism \u2013 particularly health-care tourism Taiwan is growing its technology sector Hong Kong and Singapore are expanding their financial services and wealth-management industries China is expanding its regional reach Over the coming decades, China will continue to become more assertive while advocating a policy of \u201cinclusive globalization\u201d \u2013 all at a time when the US is becoming more self-centred. President Xi\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d program and similar initiatives are undoubtedly geopolitical in nature. They are meant to promote the regional development of infrastructure and boost the interconnectedness of trade and people. If these efforts are successful, Asia will be able to rely less on the US economy and the US dollar over time. Indeed, the US dollar is already becoming less important in global trade transactions: SWIFT banking usage fell from 50 per cent in 2010 to less than 40 per cent in 2017, and it may fall further as China internationalizes the renminbi. Leverage, credit quality and currency reserves have improved throughout Asia As Asia\u2019s financial markets reflect the improving health of Asia\u2019s economy, Asian sovereign bonds are becoming, somewhat counterintuitively, a defensive play within investors\u2019 portfolios: Low leverage. The advantageous debt situation of Asian nations compared with that of other industrial countries could help Asian credit markets remain in the \u201cGoldilocks\u201d sweet spot, provided continued economic growth keeps default rates low. Increasing credit quality. Financial stability, economic reform, improving fundamentals, and lower trade and budget deficits (compared with Europe, Japan and the US) have prompted a number of agencies to upgrade the credit ratings of Asian countries (see Figure 2). Figure 2: Steady improvement in ratings of Asian countries S&P ratings; 2002 vs 2017 Source: Bloomberg, Standard & Poor's, Allianz Global Investors Capital Markets & Thematic Research. Data as at March 2017; 2002 rating (long-term foreign debt) as at the beginning of 2002. One can see clear evidence of other lessons learned since the Asian Financial Crisis: institutional frameworks have been tightened, and Asian currencies are now free-floating in the markets with little intervention. Healthy currency reserves underpin the value of many Asian nations\u2019 currencies (see Figure 3), and transparent economic policies are now at work. Case in point: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Indonesian President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo are driving significant structural reforms. Compared with the Western world\u2019s struggles with low interest rates and low productivity, something very different can be seen across Asia: real structural reforms that are re-invigorating economies and allowing the private sector to prosper and innovate. Figure 3: Asian countries have significantly increased currency reserves Source: Datastream, Allianz Global Investors Capital Markets & Thematic Research. Data as at March 2017. Not listed: Vietnam (USD 23.7bn in 2007 vs USD 28.6bn in 2017); Pakistan (USD 13.4bn in 2007 vs USD 22.2bn in 2017). A bright future for Asian fixed income Asian sovereign credits appear well-anchored Asian debt markets have grown bigger and deeper, totalling around 1 trillion in US dollars and around USD 13 trillion in local currencies \u2013 clearly avoiding an overreliance on the US dollar. Growth in these markets is being fuelled by Asia\u2019s savers putting their money to work in Asia, not exporting it to the US to finance excessive US consumption. Over time, of course, this balance will change; the US will be forced to save more and spend less as it ages. Crucially, Asia has watched many developed economies adopt expensive welfare, health care and pension entitlements \u2013 which, while politically popular, have become utterly unaffordable given today\u2019s low interest rates and low growth rates. Instead, many Asian governments have encouraged individual savings through insurance and asset-management products, which will increase the regional demand for more fixed-income investments. Without the financial albatross of excessive entitlements, we expect Asian sovereign credits to remain well-anchored. Asia\u2019s sovereign bonds will likely be less endangered by rising interest rates and less vulnerable to Western policies of financial repression, which erode the purchasing power of their citizens\u2019 savings. Asian fixed income looks attractive compared with the US From an investment perspective, most Asian currencies appear undervalued against their true potential \u2013 and especially undervalued against the US dollar, which we expect to see weaken over the next few years. We believe this will prompt more investors to pursue undervalued opportunities in regions with better fiscal fundamentals \u2013 a felicitous confluence of events for Asian bonds. Greater demand for Asian fixed income, both from within and without With a growing emphasis on individual responsibility for pensions, education and health care, Asia is likely to see growing demand for all types of financial assets \u2013 and fixed-income securities top the list. Risk-averse Asian investors may be particularly attracted to the good credit ratings and strong financials of many Asian sovereign bonds. For global bond portfolios, Asian bonds can be a crucial ingredient. They have the potential to not only enhance returns in US dollars and local currencies, but to help reduce portfolio risk. To that end, we expect the drivers of future returns to be positive, founded on a host of encouraging factors: Currency strength throughout the region Safe and credible sovereign ratings and finances Attractive yields, particularly within the global context of financial repression Solid economic regional growth, which may lead to lower corporate-default levels The growing maturity of corporate and individual investors as savings markets deepen and economies continue to prosper Ample scope for long-term growth With the painful lessons of the 1990s learned, and with solid reforms in place, Asia offers exciting economic growth and investment potential without the distorted monetary policy in effect across much of the developed world. Thanks to China\u2019s rebalancing efforts and its opening-up of currency, bond and equity markets, we expect to see new investment opportunities present themselves to regional and global investors over time. Economies across Asia should be able to generate good corporate prospects, enabling an ever-improving corporate bond market and creating a strong tax feedback loop that could allow governments to fund new investments and create even more attractive long-term opportunities.

Among them were members of generation Z \u2013 a young demographic that, at least for now, places a much greater emphasis on lifestyle experiences over retirement savings. Key takeaways Grassroots study results: 58% of boomers and 22% of generation Z are married; 74% of boomers and 39% of generation Z own property In our new survey, retirement is currently the top financial priority of only 36% of boomers and 4% of generation Z Generation Z is much more focused on having life experiences (27%) and paying down student debt (18%) than saving for retirement Consumers have long been the driving force behind the US economy, powering an estimated 70 per cent of US gross domestic product with their spending. To learn more about what fuels the lifestyle and consumption preferences of US consumers, Grassroots\u2120 Research \u2013 AllianzGI\u2019s proprietary investigative-research team \u2013 commissioned interviews with 841 respondents throughout the country. What we found sheds light on several key differences between generations \u2013 including baby-boomers, who are well-understood, and \u201cgeneration Z\u201d, which is just now beginning to make its preferences known. Our survey reached people born between 1942 and 1997. For the purposes of this study, we defined baby-boomers as those born between 1942 and 1964, and generation Z as those born between 1991 and 1997. Notable lifestyle differences between boomers and generation Z As expected, we found several notable differences between the oldest and youngest survey respondents: Marriage \u2013 54 per cent of all respondents, 58 per cent of baby-boomers and 22 per cent of generation Z are married Parenthood \u2013 64 per cent of all respondents, 65 per cent of boomers and 27 per cent of generation Z are parents Property ownership \u2013 62 per cent of all respondents, 74 per cent of boomers and 39 per cent of generation Z own a house or apartment How Different Is Generation Z from the Rest? Survey respondents born between 1991 and 1997 are just starting out their adult lives, as reflected in their lifestyle choices. Source: GrassrootsSM Research. Data as at August 2017. Saving for retirement is not yet a priority for generation Z When we asked our survey respondents about their top financial priorities today, we learned that retirement was the most frequently cited concern by only 36 per cent of baby-boomers. About one-quarter of boomer respondents said their biggest priority today had to do with the costs associated with owning a home \u2013 such as mortgage costs, association fees, maintenance/upkeep and purchasing furniture. Meanwhile, 27 per cent of generation Z respondents put the most emphasis on life experiences \u2013 such as dining/entertainment, travel and social activities. At the same time, about one-fifth of those in generation Z said paying down student debt was their most important priority. Saving for retirement topped the financial to-do list for only 4 per cent of generation Z members. To see how their focus shifted over time, we also asked the respondents to tell us about their financial priorities over the next five and ten years. Retirement steadily climbed up the priority ladder for baby-boomers, 49 and 54 per cent of whom cited it as their most important financial concern for the next five and 10-year periods, respectively. Many of our generation Z respondents, on the other hand, changed their priorities when thinking about the next five years: purchasing a home was the most-cited priority for people we spoke to, topping the list for about one-quarter of respondents. When we asked other generational cohorts the same questions, retirement topped the list of financial priorities in 10 years for those born between 1965 and 1973 (46 per cent) and those born between 1973 and 1980 (32 per cent). Generation Z Not Yet Focused on Retirement Our survey of 841 respondents asked about their top financial priorities today, in 5 years and in 10 years. The most-cited choices for each time period are marked in bold. Source: GrassrootsSM Research. Data as at August 2017. Life-stage progression should lead to a shifting financial focus To Financial Services Research Analyst Katherine He, this Grassroots\u2120 Research study shows clear evidence of how consumers\u2019 life stages can shift their financial priorities: \u201cStudent debt is a particularly high burden to generation Z, even more so than to the millennial cohort immediately ahead of them. Over the next five years, we can infer that we\u2019ll see increasing home-purchasing activity by millennials as they begin to have children. Meanwhile, generation Z is likely to focus on reducing their debt now before shifting their focus to buying a home \u2013 and, even later, to saving for retirement.\u201d GrassrootsSM Research is a division of Allianz Global Investors that commissions investigative market research for asset-management professionals.
