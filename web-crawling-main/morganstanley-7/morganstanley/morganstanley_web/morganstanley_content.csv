"July saw a rally in major developed markets, which had their best month this year, despite the U.S. going into a technical recession. The S&amp;P 500 (TR) (USD) was up 9.2%, the MSCI Europe (TR) (EUR) followed at 7.6% and the MSCI Japan (TR) (JPY) was up by 4.0%1. Emerging markets did not receive the same boost, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (USD) marginally down -0.2%1. The last week of July saw a broad-based decline in yields globally. The U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield moved down from 3%2 at the end of June to 2.64%3 by month end. The VIX index also moved down to 213. × Despite the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) surprising to the upside at 9.1%4, a lot of pessimism over inflation prospects appears already to be priced in. There is evidence that demand may come down, and has already done so for gasoline5, as consumers feel the impact of high inflation and a slowing economy. A technical recession, with U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) coming in negative for the second consecutive quarter at -0.9% (Q2 2022)6, did not deter markets, which rallied. With the Federal Reserve hiking 75bps7, as expected, in the same week, markets may be sensing peak hawkishness. Remaining in the U.S., Q2 earnings have beaten expectations and guidance for the next quarter appears not as bad as markets feared. However, though we have seen a substantial derating in valuations, we do not think equities have priced downward revisions in earnings. Depending on the depth of the slowdown to come, our estimates suggest earnings for the S&amp;P 500 should be 12% – 19% lower than current levels8. This supports our belief that recent strength in developed markets is a bear market rally, so we could still see further downside. Investment Implications We remained defensive throughout the month, seeing earnings revision downgrades as the next major potential headwind for equities. Our overall fixed income exposure also remained unchanged, in an environment of high inflation, rising rates, continued geopolitical concerns and intensifying threats to global growth. However, within equities, commodities and fixed income, we made a number of tactical changes: Energy We reduced our overweight to energy. While supply constraints persist with U.S. producers, demand destruction is evident in the U.S.. As global growth continues to slow, cyclical headwinds will likely intensify, which should be negative for oil prices and the energy sector. UK, Value and Growth Equities We moved from overweight to neutral UK Equities, an overweight we had held since February 2022 and, likewise, moved from overweight to neutral Value Equities. For both, economic cycle dynamics warrant a reduction in cyclical exposure. Instead, we allocated to broad-based equities, to maintain stable equity exposure. For portfolios which have active funds, we continued to reduce allocations to growth-oriented active funds. China A Equities We added to our overweight China A, first implemented in June 2022, which we continue to believe should benefit from improving growth prospects and supportive policy backdrop, whilst the rest of the world experiences monetary tightening and slowing growth. Broad Commodities We moved overweight to neutral broad commodities due to slowing growth and signs of less supply-demand imbalance. We took profits on this position, held since the beginning of February 2022. This was initially an explicit hedge against escalating Russia-Ukraine tensions, which we held given the tight market. Agriculture First initiated in early May, we moved overweight to neutral agricultural commodities. Inventories are greater than expected, leading to less support for prices in the second half of the year. Gold We reduced our overweight to gold. Near-term upside potential is limited based on its long-held relationship with real yields and our view that real yields should stay in positive territory. European Investment Grade Credit We moved from neutral to overweight European Investment Grade Credit. Spreads appear already priced for material growth slowdown. This, coupled with slightly cheap Bund yields, should lead to a more favourable risk/reward set up, as the global economy is in the late stage of the cycle. U.S. High Yield We moved from neutral to underweight U.S. High Yield, given our cautious outlook on U.S. growth and consumption. We believe U.S. High Yield may suffer more from a potential economic shock over the coming months compared to higher quality credit. Euro (EUR) We moved from underweight to neutral, as the euro is pricing in bearish economic growth in the eurozone and we may have reached peak fear on Russian gas supply. Likely elevated energy prices should maintain pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) to be hawkish in forthcoming months. This should support interest rate differentials, which are already inferring higher EUR/USD. With downside risks likely largely priced in the eurozone, the euro could start to revert to fundamentals in 2H 2022. Japanese Yen (JPY) We moved first from underweight to neutral, then to overweight, as the downside to JPY against the USD appears to become more and more limited. Interest rate differentials, oil prices and other fundamental drives indicate the JPY is undervalued.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser’s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio’s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio’s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. × Andrew Harmstone Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Manfred Hui Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Select Product(s) Right Click Edit",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/bear-market-rally.html

"As monetary policy normalizes post-covid and market volatility increases due to inflation and other concerns, investors may be seeking ways to add resiliency to their portfolios. It could therefore be an opportune time to consider the inherently risk-mitigating characteristics of long-short equity strategies. × As the name suggests, long-short equity strategies invest both long and short in publicly traded equities and equity-related instruments. Compared to their long-only counterparts, long-short strategies are designed to have lower sensitivity to equity market movements, as measured by beta, volatility and drawdowns. When included as part of a broadly diversified portfolio, such strategies have the potential to: (1) generate profits from their long and short positions and (2) provide an element of risk mitigation, or hedge, when markets decline because gains on short positions will dampen losses on long positions. “What is shorting? Short selling involves borrowing shares and selling them at a certain price on the assumption that the price will decline, allowing the seller to buy shares back at a lower price and return them to the owner. Short selling is only profitable when share prices decline and may be exposed to steep losses if share prices rise.” × A Broad Category With A Strategy For Every Risk Appetite A range of strategies fall under the general category of long-short equity (Display 1). In our view, the most compelling strategy in today’s market environment would be a low-net or zero-net strategy, otherwise known as “market neutral.” Compared to other long-short equity strategies, market neutral strategies tend to exhibit low or zero beta, lower market risk, lower market volatility and seek to generate returns through stock selection. These strategies are not designed to shoot the lights out, but they have the potential to provide steady gains even in down markets. × Display 1 Characteristics of Long-Short Equity Strategies  × Display 1 Characteristics of Long-Short Equity Strategies Long-Short Strategies Are Also Actively Managed In addition to the potentially risk-mitigating benefits of including short positions, long-short strategies typically have flexibility to adjust their risk profiles in response to changing market conditions. They are not required to maintain static exposures, nor are they tethered to a benchmark. Managers of market-neutral strategies can take a variety of steps to reduce risk and protect capital, specifically: Reduce overall portfolio gross exposure by selling longs and covering shorts at the same time, so that the portfolio has less capital at risk Reduce position sizes to reduce volatility Incorporate portfolio protection in the form of index hedges, futures or options Long-Short Strategies Have Held Their Own In Prior Market Downturns During the bear markets of 2000-2002 and 2007-2008, the down markets of mid-2011 and late-2018, the chaotic beginning of 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, and the 2022 bear market, long-short equity strategies broadly, as measured by the HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index, and market-neutral strategies more specifically, as measured by the HFRI Equity Market Neutral Index, achieved their goal of mitigating downside risk relative to the broad markets across a variety of metrics (Display 2). × Display 2 Long-Short Equity Performance During Downturns  × Display 2 Long-Short Equity Performance During Downturns Among long-short equity strategies, market-neutral strategies have proven particularly adept at managing downside risk over time, while allowing investors to participate in up markets as well (Displays 3 and 4). × Display 3 Down and Up Capture Ratios for HFRI EH: Market Neutral Index vs. MSCI World Net (USD) Index  Source: Bloomberg as of July 31, 2022.

Four main risks will always face long-short equity investors: MARKET RISK: the risk of loss due to the impact of general market movements. IDIOSYNCRATIC RISK: the risk of loss due to company-specific factors that are generally not correlated with the broad market movement. SHORT-SALE RISK: the risk that an investment sold short generates significant losses because the stock price appreciates. LEVERAGE RISK: the risk of loss due to unexpected interaction between longs and shorts or an improperly hedged portfolio. Conclusion These are unprecedented times, and investors are likely looking for ways to increase the resiliency of their portfolios. In our view, including an allocation to market-neutral strategies in a well-balanced portfolio could provide valuable downside risk-mitigating benefits. × Eric Stampfel Managing Director AIP Hedge Fund Team",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/long-short-equity-strategies-hedging-your-bets4.html

"When the 15-nation UN security council hastily called for a vote in February to condemn Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, India joined China and Qatar to abstain. It was a difficult balancing act. Delhi didn’t want to alienate Russia, an important historical friend, which supplies 46% of its military equipment,1 without also antagonizing the U.S., its largest trading partner.2 India also depends on Russia’s diplomatic support at the UN for its claims over Kashmir. Afterall, the Soviet Union has used its veto six times at the Security Council on India’s behalf. × For Delhi, though the abstention vote was an embarrassment, the clear and present dangers come from a prickly Pakistan and a muscular China. India is forging its own geopolitical path in this multipolar world and focusing on its strategic interests. That means siding both with Russia and joining Western alliances, such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, alongside the United States, Australia, and Japan. From Brussels to Tokyo to Washington, governments are determined to lower their dependence on Beijing. At a time of when investability in China is being questioned, shifting geopolitical realities offer India an opportunity to shine. Coupled with its geopolitical stance, India’s economic condition is looking favorable for the rest of this decade. India has not been able to realize the kind of industrial transformation that turned countries like China and South Korea into miracle economies by building their manufacturing capabilities. Instead, India’s economic growth was led by services unlike the Asian tigers. Recently there has been a change in the mindset from the Gandhian principles of small is beautiful, to actively incentivizing large scale manufacturing capacities through production linked incentive (PLI) schemes. These schemes have attracted interest across 14 sectors including automobiles, solar panels, and advanced batteries. Buoyed by the government's PLI scheme, India now is an exporter of mobile phones. Delhi is also focusing on import substitution in manufacturing to enhance domestic capacity and reduce external dependence. As firms everywhere reconfigure supply chains to lessen their reliance on China, India has an opportunity to increase its manufacturing, helped by a $26 billion subsidy scheme.3 Emerging sectors such as aerospace, semiconductors, and renewables should help increase youth employment. The reform measures are starting to pay off. The “Make in India” initiative encourages both foreign and domestic investment in the manufacturing sector; “Smart Cities” aims to eradicate urban squalor and “Digital India” targets an overhaul of government services with electronic identity, digital payments, and bank accounts. Additionally, the government has launched its Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) in an attempt to deepen e-commerce penetration and foster innovation by start-ups with a special focus on small merchants and rural consumers. Each of these are enhancements in efforts to improve the country’s infrastructure. India has backed the “tech stack” and direct welfare and persevered with the painful task of shrinking the informal economy. Financial reforms have made it easier to float young firms and bankrupt bad ones. × Display 1 India Missed the Global Real Estate PartyReal House Price Appreciation: 2015 – 3Q21  Source: OECD as of 3Q21 × Display 1 India Missed the Global Real Estate PartyReal House Price Appreciation: 2015 – 3Q21 Source: OECD as of 3Q21 In contrast, China continues to focus on transitioning its economy away from investment to consumption. China’s economy is slowing down, faced with a shrinking workforce, industrial overcapacity, a floundering property market, a mountain of debt and renewed COVID lockdowns. A serious downturn in the property market, a key engine of GDP growth, has eroded confidence in the economy. Real estate lies at the heart of an investment cycle. While investment to GDP ratio in India hovers at 30%, China’s has peaked at 45% and a big share of that is real estate investment.4 The real estate sector accounts for around 29% of GDP in China, more than double the ratio in India, according to IMF economist Yuanchen Yang.5 Excessive supply is dragging down China’s heavily indebted property sector. The working-age population in China is now shrinking,6 which will further erode the demand for housing over the coming years hurting future growth. The reverse holds in India. After being in doldrums for the past 3 years, India’s real estate sector is set to recover. As more of India’s population heads to the cities, demand for housing increases. India’s young work force stands to benefit from affordability at almost unprecedented levels in terms of mortgage payments relative to income growth, that has declined to 28% in Q1 2022 from 53% in 2012.7 House prices are 3.2 times average income in India compared to 6.7 times in China.8 In fact, the five biggest cities in the world, with the lowest rental yields, are all in China, making it one of the most expensive countries in the world. × Display 2 India Beats China on Housing AffordabilityHome Price to Income Multiple  Source: MSIM, JPM, NBS, HDFC × Display 2 India Beats China on Housing AffordabilityHome Price to Income Multiple Source: MSIM, JPM, NBS, HDFC Residential inventory levels have declined to a nine-year low of 24 months of sales for the top seven cities in India.9 Nominal wage growth of around 8% should fuel demand just at a time when supply has declined.10 China’s economy is also more levered, with total debt to GDP at 300%.11 Chinese property developers have excessively high debt levels. Goldman Sachs expects a third of China’s property firms to default this year and a massive chunk of onshore and offshore bonds are maturing by the end of 2022.12 Two of the largest have already defaulted on their offshore bond repayments. Corporate bonds of property developers are trading at less than 50 cents to the dollar.13 Household debt has risen from almost nothing in 2007 to 62% of GDP today, mainly on account of rising mortgage debt.14 China’s households are refusing to pay mortgages in 50 cities.15 Chinese property firms are facing debt deflation, falling asset prices with high debt burden, whereas property markets in India have healthy debt ratios and in our view, a high probability of increasing asset prices. India’s real estate sector has been cleansed of weak players. Developers have been prudent with their finances and have cut their balance sheet debt by half over the last 3 years.16 As Indian developers are not allowed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to take loans from abroad, there are no dollar-denominated borrowings in the sector. The banking sector today stands much healthier with steadily improving nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios and no asset quality concerns as such.17 According to the RBI, businesses have seen a steady net profit-to-sales growth over the past year and are sitting on piles of cash. × Display 3 Declining Developer Debt : A Sign of Improving Property MarketsIndia Property Developer Borrowing  Source: MS Research × Display 3 Declining Developer Debt : A Sign of Improving Property MarketsIndia Property Developer Borrowing Source: MS Research It is true that India will face headwinds from geopolitical uncertainties. Inflation and global supply chain disruptions will challenge the government’s ability to smoothly manage the economy, however macro fundamentals today are stronger than that seen during the 2013-14 period. But unlike China today, Indians benefit from a healthy real estate market and global businesses seeking more resilient and cost-effective alternatives to China. The stage is set for Delhi to move forward with an investment cycle to create a path for growth. That way, India truly emerge from under the shadow of China. × DOWNLOAD TALES FROM THE EMERGING WORLD .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:fit-content; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective.

"In this roundtable discussion, Navindu Katugampola speaks with Morgan Stanley sustainability experts Jessica Alsford, Chris Ortega and Vikram Raju about the prospects and potential pitfalls that the energy transition faces at this critical time for the global energy industry. Be it pressure from high energy prices or the need for action to meet ambitious carbon reduction targets set by national governments and corporate leaders, the status quo appears increasingly unsustainable. With the energy industry at a crossroads, the key concern today is whether the transition to alternative energy will spring forward or fall back. × What are the roots of today’s energy crisis? Do you believe that rampant price increases will help to catalyze the energy transition? Jessica Alsford (JA): The crisis has a couple of key drivers. To start, energy prices were already rising last year due to the post-lockdown surge in demand. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exacerbated the situation. Russia, the world’s third largest oil producer, supplies roughly 40% of the EU’s natural gas imports.1 The war, which led to a supply shock with knock-on price rises, may temporarily slow the transition if European countries resort to significant coal-based power generation to shore up their energy security. In terms of carbon intensity, coal is approximately 2.25 times2 worse than gas. For perspective, in 2021, roughly 16% of the EU’s electricity derived from fossil fuels, 27% from nuclear and 40% from renewables.2 If you input the carbon intensity metrics, for every percentage point of power generation that switches from gas to coal, we calculate that total carbon intensity increases by roughly 2%. Aside from coal, European countries may turn to liquified natural gas (LNG). Germany, for example, is planning to construct two LNG import terminals. However, LNG projects’ typical three-to-five-year development timeline means that terminal construction is not a near-term solution. In our view, in any future planning, governments need to think about energy security and the energy transition as complementary and not competing pathways. Ahead of 2030, we expect a significant acceleration in energy investment in Europe, with initiatives such as the REPowerEU strategy in the works. As part of the transition, nuclear may recede as an energy source; nuclear is losing attractiveness as a solution given the perceived risks and high actual costs. Beyond this, nuclear lead times are 10 to 15 years, far longer than the roughly six years for solar and wind. Considering the infrastructure development timelines and urgency of current circumstances, how do you expect today’s situation to impact the process of energy transition? Chris Ortega (CO): All considered, we expect the transition to accelerate with existing infrastructure playing a key part. There are two main reasons: costs and time. Costs can be split into the direct costs for converting infrastructure and the associated costs for building its surrounding value chain and ecosystem. To be candid, only modest savings can be achieved via these infrastructure conversions, but for many projects they are not far from a cost equivalency. Cost benefits can be garnered, however, by reducing costs related to the support systems for new infrastructure. For instance, a terminal that frequently replenishes renewable diesel requires a whole intermodal value chain surrounding the port and storage tankage—e.g., rail and trucking transportation. If that existing infrastructure can be converted to be greener, that can be materially less costly across the value chain. In terms of time, relatively quick and efficient solutions, such as blending hydrogen with gas, can be cost and time effective when compared to, say, building a new plant. We expect to see more easy-to-implement solutions like these in the near term. In addition to converting legacy infrastructure, we expect upgrades to existing green infrastructure. For example, wind turbines in the U.S., which were built 15 years ago with first-generation technology, now require refurbishment to bring them up to modern standards. On a cost and time basis, we anticipate that the retrofitting and repurposing of existing infrastructure will form an integral part of the transition. Have client demands changed in response to recent events? If so, does climate investing still resonate with asset owners? Vikram Raju (VR): The short-term spike in commodity prices has obviously made people think about the energy transition. Consumers of traditional energy are a little panicked right now and are starting to rethink their reliance on fossil fuels. As a result, people are becoming more comfortable with shorter transition timelines. Moreover, putting aside geopolitical developments, the transition has been underway for years, with an array of stakeholders pursuing their own individual clean-energy agendas. We have seen companies, regulators, consumers and employees all vote with their feet and capital to advance the energy transition in their own way. Corporate leaders, for instance, must incorporate decarbonization into their strategic vision for the future when thinking about potential cost increases, the security of supply lines and what plans will resonate with markets. Therefore, from a pure private equity growth investing point of view that looks beyond climate concerns alone, we see change afoot that should support the viability of these businesses over five, 10 or 15 years. In this way, we have not really seen the trend toward transition diminish so much as accelerate. If investing in resiliency is beneficial through cycles from a corporate perspective, what are companies doing to respond to today’s challenging conditions? Are they inclined to curtail capital expenditure into cleaner energy projects or commit to this strategic, longer-term investment? JA: Clearly, companies view the time frames for transition in a variety of ways. If heightened volatility and higher prices impact free cash flows this year, costly capital projects will arguably become less likely in the short term. That said, only eight years remain until 2030 and 28 years until 2050. The pressure is on for companies to act toward their net-zero targets. Consequently, we foresee significant innovation for the decade ahead, as companies test new solutions in the hope that capital costs fall by 2030 and onward. Here, a look at a specific industry can be instructive. Cement producers, for instance, are moving toward decarbonization in two stages. Stage one is comparatively inexpensive, relying on the rollout of best-in-class technology to improve thermal efficiency. In this phase, producers can reap savings thanks to reduced fuel usage and lower carbon taxes. The second stage, however, requires investment in costlier, longer-term solutions, such as carbon capture and storage, which investors hope will become less expensive ahead. Beyond timeframes, we believe that today’s energy crisis actually improves the economics for alternative energy solutions. Companies will carefully consider greener options in the current environment, and we may even see traditional energy players opt to invest their strong profits into clean technology. How do you think about the role of fossil fuels in bridging the move to clean energy? For instance, does reliance on cleaner fossil fuels allow companies to avoid the more fundamental issues related to the energy transition? CO: We believe LNG will be critical in moving the world toward cleaner energy. Remember that political and corporate leaders must balance the need to reduce their carbon footprints while sustaining growth; recent history shows that LNG can play a role here. Specifically, U.S. carbon emissions have remained fairly flat for 15 years even as economic output increased threefold, with improved carbon efficiency underpinned by the switch to gas from coal. On a global level, however, carbon emissions continue to rise. In part, this reflects emerging markets’ high dependence on coal. Construction is underway to expand coal power capacity by 150 gigawatts, which will mostly offset capacity retired by the U.S. over the past 15 years. Clearly, the energy transition is a global project that cannot be thought of along strict geographic lines. In the context of private markets, where do you currently see the greatest opportunities and how do you, in your investment practice, balance managing the dual objectives of climate-positive impact with returns? VR: As private equity growth investors, we focus in areas where the technology has been proven, the market exists and the investee company has an order book. To the degree that a company may have a fundamentally carbon-negative component to their business model, there is no tension in having this dual mandate. If the company succeeds, the impact solution succeeds. If it fails, it fails on both counts simultaneously. Ultimately, every company that we underwrite is carefully evaluated to ensure that it is viable, commercially attractive and has a stated commitment to net-zero emissions. For instance, we may invest in a company that supplies other businesses, helping them to avoid, reduce or eliminate the carbon footprint for their final products. In practice that might mean that we invest in a software developer that creates programs to improve energy transmission efficiency, a major constraint that has slowed the commissioning of greener energy production. In this hypothetical example, the investee company would become a crucial enabler in the infrastructure ecosystem for alternative energy. How credible are corporate plans in emerging markets compared to developed markets in terms of the transition and the drive toward net-zero? VR: On a pure economic basis, switching to renewables could be very powerful for many emerging markets. Be that for India, a net oil importer, or Nigeria, a large producer with insufficient refining capacity. We know, for instance, that for a local bank branch in Lagos, the number one cost is running diesel generators. Remarkably, introducing solar solutions could help to cut a branch’s energy bill by an estimated 50%. Financing is another area where investors can make an impact. In India, for example, demand has always been there for solutions such as solar, but it simply has not been easy to translate that into greater profitability. Backing financiers to fund solar developers and buyers on the condition that they provide solar loans to these groups could help resolve this problem. As underwriters, they can discern the good from bad credits to determine the pain points and best areas to allocate capital. The cost-saving benefits can be immediate for energy consumers, while also making loan repayments manageable over a matter of years. We are seeing these types of financial services products being rolled out in places like India, where poor grid connections create demand for diesel generators, which, as we have alluded to, are ripe for solar replacements. CO: At the country and corporate level, we have witnessed a broad movement toward less CO2-intensive activities as political and business leaders aim to hit their given targets. In many cases, however, it could be argued that these actors are not necessarily reducing their CO2 emissions at the global level, which ties into my response to your previous question. For example, if companies are simply offshoring certain activities, how do we count this? If a country bans coal-based power in their country, but imports electricity from neighboring countries with more relaxed standards, does that really equate to a reduction in the carbon footprint? Simply put, no it does not. We need to be thinking about this broader picture when defining our CO2 targets because the goal is ultimately to reduce, not just shift carbon use by geography. Will the rising costs and scarcity of resources act as a barrier to green energy demand? And how can the energy transition be inclusive and affordable to a broad cross-section of society if costs fail to come down? CO: On the power generation side for wind and solar, we have seen a consistent reduction in costs alongside an increase in efficiency over time. For electric vehicles, prices primarily depend on battery costs. Unlike for internal combustion engine vehicles, batteries comprise roughly 50% of the electric vehicle value. As such, the residual value of one’s electric vehicle may change as the battery life declines over time. In our opinion, this factor may spur breakthroughs in areas such as battery recycling. Recycling speaks directly to your point regarding scarcity of resources; for example, could recycling of lithium and cobalt help to meet rising demand for these key battery inputs? At the very least, we know it will help. Supply constraints elsewhere may also advance recycling developments. For instance, the Russia-Ukraine situation is impacting nickel pricing and raises questions around alternative sourcing and, frankly, other ESG issues related to conducting business in areas that are complicated from a jurisdictional and rule-of-law perspective. Thus, developing smarter ways to recycle inputs for use in next generation batteries looks like an attractive solution. The link to the value chain could help to sustain residual values in electric vehicles as well. Notably, we are only beginning to understand these dynamics better as we reach a milestone in terms of seeing trade-ins from the early adopters of electric cars. VR: Picking up on that point, the cost curve definitely has its limits. Therefore, energy efficiency and finding small fixes to help derive value in the supply chain is key. Software that helps to lower energy consumption by households, vehicles and corporates is a good example; software can also be used for efficiency gains on the power generation side. Gearboxes in vehicles can even play a part too. Individually, these are all relatively small marginal cost-savings, but together they can play a critical role in boosting efficiency and bringing down costs across the spectrum. In practice, how have you seen institutional investors address climate change within their portfolios? JA: When I started in this space around 10 years ago, strict exclusion lists predominated. Gradually, investors became interested in companies that were allocating capital toward green solutions. In conversations we have today, there seems to be a recognition that companies pass through a phase of transition, which investors can support through engagement. Of course, such engagement implies working with companies that presently may be high emitters, but which possess the potential to reduce their carbon footprint. On balance, there seems to be a much greater willingness from investors to not only invest in solution providers, but also to engage the companies that would otherwise perpetuate the status quo. VR: Five years ago, debates mainly revolved around whether climate investing could make money. From today’s vantage point, we think it is fairly clear that that debate has been settled. In the industry, we have seen investors rewarded for supporting companies across a diverse range of climate-related businesses. Moreover, we saw growth businesses earning growth-like returns without penalties to returns simply because the companies operated in climate-focused sectors. Today, the adoption of climate considerations into a portfolio has become more mainstream. At the same time, debates have moved on. We see some questions around the magnitude of impact that a given dollar amount should create; currently, there is no universal metric for this. We can look at the CO2 aims, but not in a way that is clearly linked to the per dollar unit of investment. We see progress toward this aim, but for the adoption of such a metric, more people active in the industry will have to embrace the idea. CO: In our conversations with limited partners, these investors want to understand how we quantify impact. We are taking what 10 years ago was a qualitative conversation and putting numbers behind that. On a portfolio company by portfolio company basis, what impact are we having and how do we kind of continue to make sure, from a process perspective, that we are continuing to optimize? Of course, there is wide recognition that no true endpoint exists. The energy transition is more like a journey in which we continue to push forward and evolve. × 1 Source: Morgan Stanley Research, March 2022. 2 Source: Morgan Stanley Research, March 2022. × Navindu Katugampola Global Head of Sustainability, Investment Management and the Global Head of Sustainable Investing, Fixed Income Global Fixed Income Team Jessica Alsford Global Head of Sustainability Research, Morgan Stanley Research × Vikram Raju Head of Climate Investing | Private Markets AIP Private Markets Team Chris Ortega Americas Investing, Infrastructure Partners Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/energy-at-a-crossroads.html
"Despite macro uncertainties, global capital spending continues to surge after a period of short-lived contraction in 2020, powering the post-pandemic economic recovery. We expect U.S. Investment Grade Corporate CAPEX to increase +15% in 2022, maintaining the +14% year-over-year (YoY) momentum in 2021 (Display 1). Its impact on fundamental credit profile flows through all three financial statements: CAPEX is a key determinant of cash flow, of multi-year leverage trajectory and debt supply, as well as of future revenue and margins through capturing demand and increasing productivity over time. We view U.S. Technology as a clear winner, while U.S. Utilities and U.S. Telecom emerge as sectors most under pressure (Display 2). × DISPLAY 1 Global CAPEX Is on the Rise  Source: S&amp;P Global CAPEX Survey 2021.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau 2022 Capital Spending Report (Display 3), from 2011 to 2020 U.S. non-farm businesses increased total spending from $1,243.0 billion to $1,706.4 billion, an increase of $463.5 billion (+37.3%). The increase was led by Utilities (+85.8% or $84.2bn), partially offset by the largest decrease in the Mining sector (-41.4% or $68.6bn). Underlying this trend are three driving factors: Sustainability, Supply chain, and Security. The Three Reasons CAPEX Is Rising: Sustainability, Supply Chain, Security The broader transition to a more sustainable global economy drives higher CAPEX across industries in order to reduce carbon emissions, protect water supply and improve the environmental and social impact of supply chains over the long term. Key themes include electric vehicles (EV), utility grid upgrades, transition from fossil fuels to renewables, and overall energy efficiency. × DISPLAY 3 U.S. Census 2022 Capital Spending Report  Source: U.S. Census Bureau 2022 Capital Spending Report × DISPLAY 3 U.S. Census 2022 Capital Spending Report Source: U.S. Census Bureau 2022 Capital Spending Report Government policies broadly incentivize and support corporate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives. The ongoing Assessment Reports of the Paris Agreement and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) helped to consolidate international support and increase corporate commitments to net zero carbon emissions, with Europe leading the way. Specifically, Europe’s “Fit for 55” package and other efforts have provided tailwinds for green CAPEX by providing command and control mechanisms such as fuel blending mandates, offering clarity in defining sustainable activities (EU Taxonomy), and adopting market-based approaches to implement carbon initiatives, which include carbon markets and border adjustment mechanisms for carbon intensive sectors such as steel, cement, aluminum, and fertilizers. Estimates on economy-wide investment requirements have an understandable spread, although they clearly exceed current capital expenditures. By 2030, annual global investment requirements to meet net zero goals are anticipated to $4 - $5.7 trillion per year in clean energy and energy infrastructure alone,1 at least three times current levels. Recent research from McKinsey suggests that using the hypothetical Net Zero 2050 scenario from the Network for Greening the Financial System, annual overall green investments needed to stay on track for net zero between now and 2050 are $9.2 trillion ($275 trillion total). While we may reflexively think of government compelled “green” capital investment as detrimental to corporate balance sheets, the European Union has put in place several mechanisms to protect European corporations from competition by taxing less-sustainable imports. The time bound, science-based goals create immediate investment pressure on both public and private sectors, particularly as the importance of achieving 2030 interim targets becomes increasingly clear. Therefore, we view Europe as a potential bellwether for the U.S. and expect to see even higher green CAPEX levels globally. Global supply chain is another hot topic—strained in normal times and stressed repeatedly in recent years for a variety of reasons—and U.S. corporates are diversifying manufacturing capabilities in response. They are also increasing efficiency and automation, bolstering productivity to address labor shortages and tight inventories. Labor inflation is a key leading indicator for manufacturing CAPEX. Under current conditions, we expect to see a cycle of elevated spending to improve profitability. Companies look to automate wherever possible in order to compensate for low labor levels and high wages, however these investments are initiated in sectors where demand outstrips supply and strong cash flows can fund the spending. In the theme of de-globalization, many industries are onshoring manufacturing capabilities to address shipping bottlenecks in the near-term and increase diversification longer-term. Companies in the Machinery, Electrical and Transportation equipment sectors are seeking to re-shore to reduce lead time and increase flexibility, whilst companies in the Aerospace, Communication, Automotive, Semiconductors, Chemicals, Medical products, Pharma sectors list national security and supply security as the top reason. This trend is broadly aligned with the U.S.’s sustainability goals and the broader economic agenda to boost domestic GDP and create jobs post pandemic. Geopolitical security has taken on heightened importance in 2022 given the ongoing Russian/Ukraine conflict in Europe. Where it intersects with Sustainability and Supply Chain, we see CAPEX dedicated to address all these concerns take priority. Namely in Agriculture and Energy sectors, along with the push for decarbonization, we see initiatives aimed at bolstering the aggregate level of supply and diversifying away from certain regions. For example, there are discussions for the U.S. and EU to boost supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in European countries by the end of 2022, which would help reduce reliance on Russian gas and incentivize greater LNG diversification. The REPowerEU plan would not only cut Russian gas imports, but also call for an accelerated integration of wind and solar, biomethane production, and heat pump addition. The goal of these plans, in collaboration with international partners, is to chart an alternative path for Europe’s energy security since Russian gas currently accounts for about 40% of total supply. SECTORS WITH STRONG TAILWINDS: Limited rating migration net of new supply. Benefits from strong government support and increased financial flexibility. We believe current CAPEX investments will directly accrue to higher productivity, better margins and drive future demand with limited impact on credit profile. The U.S. IG Technology sector is experiencing exceptionally strong underlying demand, as the pandemic both accelerated digital transformation and boosted consumer savings in the U.S. U.S. IG Technology issuers expect higher free cash flow across the board while ramping up investments to meet backlog and manage supply chain disruptions. For the IG Tech sector in particular, CAPEX spend can directly boost productivity, increases margins, and enables firms to gain greater scale. This tailwind has lifted a crop of rising stars from the BB rating category to BBB in 2021, and we expect the trend to continue. In particular, supply chain disruptions amidst this exceptionally strong demand backdrop have driven semiconductor companies to increase capital spending by $200bn+ over the next decade in the U.S. and Europe in order to secure supply. While we do expect continued debt supply from the high-rated names in the space to partly fund higher CAPEX, the impact on credit profiles and current ratings should be de minimis. Companies in the space have accumulated large cash balances, significant financial flexibility through asset sale, spin, or IPO transactions, and could expect incremental government support in boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. Overall, we expect improved credit profiles and more rising stars as strong demand creates opportunity for increased scale. SECTORS UNDER PRESSURE: Deterioration in credit profile net of new supply. Incremental CAPEX is a “tax” on free cashflow (FCF) and leverage profile driven by regulation and/or market dynamics. Higher leverage occurs without commensurate growth in future demand and profitability. U.S. Utilities – Over the past decade, U.S. electric utilities have intensified their capital spending, i) to reduce carbon pollution, ii) to update and replace aging infrastructure, iii) to harden systems and protect against more volatile weather and, iv) to pay for smart grid technology, increased security to safeguard against physical and cyber-attacks. Regulated Utilities’ prudent capital investments can have a positive impact on their Return on Equity (ROE), as it increases their underlying rate-base. In the near-term credit metrics can be negatively impacted as CAPEX is largely debt financed and with some lag expected before cash flow begins. U.S. Telecoms – Despite heavy spending on 5G wireless spectrum and CAPEX, these investments do not necessarily lead to greater pricing power or revenues. Rather, carriers are forced to make these investments in order to not fall behind in network performance and guard their respective wireless market shares. New 5G use cases are preliminarily being contemplated (i.e. – augmented reality, metaverse, internet-of-things, fixed-wireless broadband), but monetization and business models remain far from clear. While a key company predicts that the addressable market size of “network-as-a-service” will expand from $340 to $460 billion from 2021-26, CAPEX spending in Telecom is currently peaking and is expected to drop measurably in 2023, as major spectrum auctions generally occur every five years. SECTORS IN FLUX: Rife with challenges and opportunities, with final outcomes driven by public policy, level of government support, and management teams’ choices in navigating the path forward. We believe three sectors are particularly sensitive to the future course of public policy in their respective areas. Automobiles – Global Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) CAPEX, which represents ~50% of total Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) R&amp;D/CAPEX, is estimated to increase to $120 billion between 2020 and 2025. A large portion is currently funded by higher margin SUVs/ pickup trucks on strong demand, and OEMs’ continued emphasis on these vehicles over smaller/compact models. This in turn allows for the protection of operating margins that are higher than pre-pandemic levels, a positive for ratings profiles considering continued supply chain challenges and in particular, chip shortages. Over the past decade in the U.S., a variety of policies on the federal and local level have supported EV demand and helped companies scale manufacturing and battery capabilities. This was done through purchase subsidies and/or vehicle purchase and registration tax rebates, which aimed to help reduce the price gap with conventional vehicles. However, the U.S. still trails Europe &amp; China in EV sales due to less stringent government mandates, differences in infrastructure investment, and consume preference. As much as 38% of greenhouse gas emissions are caused by passenger cars.2 In order to meet stringent regulatory requirements as well as stay competitive, European automakers have increased spending on future technologies (e.g. electric car batteries and powertrain, digitalization). For example, one of the leading players is planning to spend at least 55% of its R&amp;D and CAPEX budget on these technologies, ultimately reducing tailpipe emissions of its fleet as well as reducing carbon-intensity of its production plants. Energy – After decades of structural underinvestment in traditional energy sources, the sector now must contend with optimizing CAPEX in an inflationary environment with increasing energy transition mandates. Globally, oil-based fuel consumption now stands 3% above pre-Covid levels.3 Europe’s pivot away from Russian natural gas supply is also supportive of U.S. LNG development. In this context, we are seeing 15-20% capital spending increases but only 0-5% production increases. The outliers are the supermajor integrated names which are raising their CAPEX budgets to around 30% growth as they pick-up spending on clean energy projects. EU Utilities – European utilities continue to spend heavily on the retirement of coal plants and the construction of more renewable wind and solar generation. Coal and nuclear shutdowns have occurred rapidly, offset by a sharp rise in power prices, driving the need for replacement power, stability, and security of fuel imports. The Russia/Ukraine conflict is accelerating sustainability programs in Europe, with added urgency to a longer-term pivot away from Russian natural gas supply and bolstering future energy security. Thus far higher natural gas prices have been absorbed with subsidies from governments, passed on to consumers with tariff increases. In addition, the REPowerEU plan now calls for a two-thirds reduction in gas imports from Russia by winter 2022/23 through alternative supply sources, energy efficiency/savings, electrification, and filling storage to 90% by Oct. 1, 2022 (MS Equity Research). Nuclear generation has been controversial: it is a core component for France but opposed by Germany. However, in order to accelerate transition, new construction for both nuclear and natural gas (on a temporary phase out basis) have been included in the EU taxonomy for new project spending.Another area of focus is the expansion of network grids. This includes greater regional interconnectedness, support for EV charging, and smart grids to improve efficiency for consumers. Pharma/Healthcare/Life Science &amp; Diagnostics – The Covid pandemic was a key catalyst for increased manufacturing and R&amp;D spending, where we see 50-100% increases among Life Sciences &amp; Diagnostic companies compared to pre-Covid levels. Higher CAPEX alone has limited the impact on sector credit profiles, with rating trajectory and balance sheet capacity largely determined by M&amp;A, and the outcome of U.S. drug pricing legislation. SECTORS THAT HAVE HIGH MAINTENANCE CAPEX and could benefit from targeted, long-term solutions that address higher input costs in an inflationary environment. U.S. Transportation: Airlines have heavy CAPEX commitments over the next few years as they focus on fleet renewal and right-size capacity, taking delivery of newer, more fuel-efficient aircrafts which would both lessen the impact of higher commodity prices and drive environmental goals longer-term. Travel demand and input costs are significant drivers for the sector. Trucking is moving towards automation to offset a tight labor environment, which requires large upfront costs. Rails are mostly focused on keeping CAPEX at 15% of revenue or below given continued focus to remove costs and improve profitability, though recent productivity initiatives mainly seek to offset inflationary pressures. Environmental Services: Another CAPEX intensive sector with an average spend at 12% of revenue expected for 2022, in-line with historical averages. At least one notable company is directing incremental investments in renewable natural gas capacity, as part of its broader push for sustainability initiatives and improved investor perception of the sector. Paper &amp; Packaging: CAPEX guidance increased across the board for a core group of IG issuers in 2022, aimed to drive organic capacity growth in a tight supply environment, and automation of existing assets to manage labor supply shortages. × DISPLAY 4 CAPEX Summary: Credit Profile Winners and Losers  Source: Morgan Stanley Investment Management IG Research.

The fundamental impacts of CAPEX tell one piece of the story When we think about investment allocations by sector, the effect of CAPEX on credit profiles is only one piece of the puzzle, one that must be tied to our fundamental views on valuation. The debate about where spreads are going and what is already priced in at current levels remains the key focus for credit investors. Given elevated CAPEX over a multi-year time frame, we could expect to see increasing debt supply which may push spreads wider. We offer here a visualization of potential fundamental and technical drivers of spread changes resulting from CAPEX outlook. This is based on survey responses of MSIM Fixed Income research analysts on supply outlook and credit profile trajectory of issuers in our benchmark indices. Display 4 above illustrates the relationship between directional changes in credit profiles against expected CAPEX growth and size each sector on relative scale of future CAPEX. × Download .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Risk Considerations Diversification neither assures a profit nor guarantees against loss in a declining market. There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. × Victoria Li Executive Director, Research Alana FitzGerald, CFA Associate, Research × Jim Caron Chief Strategist, Fixed Income Richard Ford Head of Investment Grade Credit Joseph Mehlman Head of U.S. Investment Grade Credit $( document ).ready(function() { $("".authorTitleName a:contains('Victoria Li')"").html(""Victoria Li, CFA""); $("".authorTitleName a:contains('Joseph Mehlman')"").html(""Joseph Mehlman, CFA""); }); Angie Salam Head of U.S. Non-Financial Research Elena Ciampichetti Head of European Non-Financial Research Patrick Holt Analyst, Research Jackie Desir Vice President, Research Kerwin Bailey Vice President, Research Michael Deich, CFA Executive Director, Research Matas Vala, CFA Vice President, Research Jeffrey Chiu Analyst, Research Raymond Singh Executive Director, Research Henry Mason Senior Associate, Calvert Jun Goh Associate, Calvert Sam Rodgier Associate, Calvert ×",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/capex-reshapes-credit-profile-sectors-in-flux.html

"The equity markets have had a terrible first half of 2022, with the MSCI World Index down over 20% in U.S. dollars (USD), the worst start to the year in over 50 years. The bizarre element is that the fall has all been down to derating, as earnings have not yet been hit. The earnings estimates for 2022 and 2023 are both up slightly, meaning that the 12-months forward earnings number is up 5% this year as it benefits from the increasing weight of the higher 2023 estimate as the year progresses. × The derating is arguably less bizarre given the extreme multiple at the start of the year, which at 19.3x forward earnings was 36% above the average between 2003 and 2019, the 17-year period between the bursting of the tech bubble and the pandemic – during which the multiple never even reached 17x. The derating has taken the multiple down to 14.6x, only 3% above the 2003-19 average. This has clearly reduced the multiple risk from here, shifting our concern to the prospects for earnings. Unfortunately, there are plenty of grounds to be anxious about earnings, even if inflation helps revenue growth, at least in nominal terms. The major threat in the short term is the prospect of an economic slowdown or recession. Central banks are attempting to counter inflation by dampening demand through higher rates. They are hoping to calibrate their rate rises to achieve a soft landing, and economic forecasts seem to think that this is achievable, with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) predicting 1-2% growth for the USA and the euro area for 2023, with inflation falling and unemployment only rising marginally. The issue is that monetary policy can be analogous to trying to shift a brick by pulling on an elastic band – there is no effect until suddenly the central bank, along with the economy as a whole, gets a brick in the face. What is clear is that there are no signs of any risk of downturn in the current earnings numbers, given the continued robustness of the estimates. The risk to earnings is raised further by the current record level of margins, with the MSCI World Index forward EBIT1 margin edging up further to 16.7% this year, as against a 13.3% average and a 15.2% peak in the 2003-19 period. It seems that the excess demand is allowing companies to pass on even more than the rise in their input costs, be it through inflation (raising prices), ‘shrinkflation’ (reducing product sizes) or ‘skimpflation’ (trimming the level of services). Any end to shortages, or worse still a shift to excess supply, could end this phase of generalised pricing power, with more commoditised companies suffering, while genuine pricing power holds up better. In the longer term, there could be further pressures on earnings, be they from rises in interest costs, the need to build more resilient supply chains, companies paying for the negative externalities they create, and even potentially from higher corporate tax rates as governments look to repair their finances. The Global Financial Crisis of 2008-9 provides an interesting precedent. The market peaked in October 2007. The first phase of the market fall was a drop of 15% over the next eight months to summer 2008, even though forward earnings rose, as the market derated – a clear parallel to the 2022 experience so far. It was only in the second half of 2008 that the earnings started to fall sharply, along with a further erosion in multiples, to arrive at the market trough another eight months later in early 2009. Whatever happens from here in 2022-23 will not be a repeat of 2008-9. However, the market’s earnings are distinctly vulnerable given their current elevated level and the probable economic slowdown. Our focus on compounders, with recurring revenues and pricing power, should mean that the portfolio’s earnings are more robust than those of the market, as was shown in 2008-9 and more recently in the first half of 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis. Given that earnings are the major risk from here, after the significant derating that has already happened, it arguably makes sense to minimise earnings risk from here by owning compounders. × 1 Earnings Before Interest and Taxation × Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy’s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. × Bruno Paulson Managing Director International Equity Team Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Previous Next",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/markets-are-down-but-earnings-are-not-yet.html

"To help close the funding gap for multicultural and women-owned businesses,1 Morgan Stanley Investment Management and the firm’s Multicultural Client Strategy Group are launching a new fund to invest in startups led by diverse entrepreneurs. The Next Level Fund will invest primarily in early-stage technology and technology-enabled companies that have women and/or multicultural members among their founding teams. This latest move by Morgan Stanley highlights opportunities with underrepresented business leaders, often targeting underserved markets and communities, and aims to help meet growing investor demand for impactful market solutions to address social justice, gender equality and racial equity. The fund is part of the Private Credit and Equity strategy within the Investment Management division, which oversees more than $1.4 trillion of assets.2 It will also be backed by three key corporate partners: Hearst, Microsoft and Walmart. “We are pleased to expand our impact-oriented client offerings with the addition of Next Level, and we are proud to partner with like-minded companies that share our commitment to delivering positive social impact through compelling investment opportunities,” says David N. Miller, Head of Private Credit and Equity at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “Our differentiated approach can help to increase access to capital for women and multicultural businesses in our target sectors.” Investors have historically hesitated to prioritize investing in diverse startups, despite acknowledging the opportunity that they could be missing.3 In fact, 60% of venture capitalists surveyed by Morgan Stanley say that their portfolios hold too few companies founded by women and multicultural entrepreneurs,4 while investors in another survey reported capitalizing diverse businesses by as much as 80% less than traditional companies overall.5 “By intentionally seeking out high-growth companies founded by multicultural and women entrepreneurs, Next Level presents an exciting opportunity for disruptive startups to increase their visibility and accelerate their businesses with the support of our corporate partners,” says Managing Director Alice Vilma, Portfolio Manager of the Next Level Fund. The fund will tap the expertise of the Multicultural Innovation Lab, Morgan Stanley’s in-house start-up accelerator, which promotes financial inclusion by providing founders of diverse tech and tech-enabled startups with access to investors, tools, resources and connections that they need to thrive. The diverse companies will gain access to the capital provided by the fund and to the global resources and capabilities of Morgan Stanley and these corporate partners, says Vilma, who is also co-head of the Multicultural Innovation Lab. “We are pleased to be partnering with Hearst, Microsoft and Walmart on this exciting new initiative, which advances our respective companies’ goals to promote financial inclusion and access to capital for women and multicultural founders.” Eve Burton, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer at Hearst, will serve on the fund’s Advisory Board. × 1 https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/venture-capital-funding-gap 2 As of March 31, 2021 3 https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/venture-capital-funding-gap 4 https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/venture-capital-funding-gap 5 https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/trillion-dollar-blind-spot-infographic × Morgan Stanley Next Level Morgan Stanley Next Level is the impact-focused private equity business of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, focusing on privately negotiated equity and equity-related investments with impact.",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/investing-in-startups-founded-by-women-and-multicultural-entrepreneurs.html
"SEC Proposal on Climate Disclosure Will Drive Real World Innovation and Speed Up Climate Solutions Washington - Corporations throughout the world are working to transition their businesses away from the use of fossil fuels because of the increasing business risks to companies from the harm this causes people, the local environment, and global climate change. This is a massive, multidecade effort that will impact the vast majority of companies and that has material implications for every living creature on the planet-and, of course, for long-term investors. The speed and the success or failure of this transition will inform quality of life for the world's population for generations to come. We are attempting to manage this with a voluntary market-led set of solutions. This is the cornerstone of capitalism. Markets need transparency to the problem. With adequate transparency, markets will finance the companies solving the problem, in anticipation of better returns. Today, we lack the necessary information from companies detailing their carbon emissions, which blocks the transparency needed to produce voluntary market-led solutions. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has proposed a set of rules for companies to disclose their carbon emissions in order to facilitate market function and to stimulate the innovation and entrepreneurship needed to hasten the transition to a cleaner energy system. As opposed to embracing this effort, many corporations and even some investors are pushing back, trying to water down or even block the SEC's efforts. In a nutshell, these companies are arguing that calculating and disclosing their carbon emissions is too complicated, too costly and could get them sued for their contributions to climate change once people see how much carbon they are discharging into the atmosphere. We suggest the free-market, capitalist approach--get the information on corporate carbon emissions out to our financial markets and solve this through innovation and market-led competition. The alternative is to have the government intervene and take some degree of control of the energy system. Transparency Is Key This is an area that should be more math than politics. Access to better climate-related data benefits all investors, allowing them to better understand the current risks to investment portfolios and to better manage such exposures. U.S. regulators have taken a measured approach to climate-related disclosure relative to other regulators around the world. It has focused on essential data to improve market function, facilitate voluntary market-led solutions and enhance competition and innovation through stronger market signals. This disclosure of information doesn't mean the SEC will then be in the business of telling the market what the numbers mean. People might disagree on the interpretation of the data, so this is unlikely to lead to universal agreement. But to attempt to eliminate or control access to this critical information would be inconsistent with improving capital market function. The Importance of Externalities It is important to have a basic framework to understand what we mean when we discuss ESG investing. At Calvert, we use the Calvert Principles for Responsible Investing to frame our information gathering and proprietary research. These correlate to globally accepted norms for responsible business conduct. You can read them on our website here. We also use the concept of externalities, which refers to the activities of a company that may result in impact to the environment or to people but are not well captured in the company financial statements. While companies create substantial positives, and they get paid for this through profits, they also create negatives. Problematic externalities include pollution, human rights abuse in supply chains, gender or racial discrimination and many others. Long-term investors like Calvert seek to understand how well companies are performing on managing all aspects of their businesses, including the elimination or reduction of harmful externalities. Some companies manage this better than others, which we think is a factor in determining which companies make better long-term investments. Over time, society figures out externalities and starts charging companies for the problems they cause. Carbon emissions are an example of a corporate externality we seek to quantify and factor into the long-term analysis of a company's future value. All else being equal, the more carbon emissions a company creates, the greater the risk to the company as society attempts to cut emissions. The Time Is Right We think that all the attention on climate change over the past decade has put society on the precipice of solving this existential crisis. Initiatives by market regulators worldwide to create more transparency to corporate externalities narrowly focused on climate change is a critical next step. The markets need the information in order to more accurately price this externality into stocks and bonds. Until we get this, markets will lack the required information and transparency to function optimally, and we will risk misallocating capital. We see companies already beginning to allocate resources in efforts to decarbonize. Examples of this can be found everywhere, including the fossil fuel industry-nearly across the board. But without transparency into carbon emissions across all corporations and the resultant market valuation of that factor, we cannot see how the markets value these decarbonization strategies. Whatever our differences are on the SEC proposal, let's be clear: This is simply about the provision of information. How one interprets the data or uses it is up to each market participant. Let's get as much transparency as possible and make our arguments in the open market, not with the regulator. Bottom line: The SEC proposal is a pro-capitalism, pro-voluntary market-led solution and may lead to improved capital allocation, increased innovation and greater competition. We should get behind it and let the markets function. Calvert's letter to the SEC related to ""The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors"" is available here. × John Streur President and Chief Executive Officer, Calvert Research and Management Calvert Research and Management",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/calverts-view-on-sec-proposal-on-climate-disclosure.html
"The tectonic plates of inflation and recession collided in June with recession winning, at least for now. Economic data continued to underperform, surprising to the downside in general, with central banks continuing or even intensifying their hawkishness. As a result, financial market performance in June and year to date cannot be characterized as anything but historic; unfortunately, historically bad! Indeed, global credit markets have experienced their worst first half performance on record. June bond returns ranged from -0.88% for U.S. Treasuries to -9.19% for emerging markets (EM) external high yield, pushing year-to-date returns into double digit negative territory.1 What is truly astonishing about 2022 has been not just that all fixed income returns have been deeply negative but that the dispersion of returns has been so small. In EM, high grade and high yield returns have been -19.69% and 20.96% respectively while U.S. High Yield has returned -14.04% while U.S. Investment Grade returned -14.39%.2 It has not mattered how you managed credit versus duration risk, both have been equally bad. In this risk-off context, it is not surprising the dollar rose substantially, confounding many long-term dollar bears. × Government bond markets were not exempt from the volatility, but hope did materialize mid-month as yields fell. First, U.S. Treasury 10-year yields rose 62 basis points (bps) in the first 14 days of the month as high inflation prints (May U.S. Consumer Price Index release printed 8.6%, higher than expected) and Fed hawkishness (larger than expected 75bps rate hike and a substantial increase in their “dot plot”) pushed the Fed’s median rate forecast to 3.8% for end-2023. Then, they rallied 46bps over the remainder of the month as recession fears rose substantially and, remarkably, the market began to price out rate hikes the Fed had just penciled in. Even with recession probabilities rising significantly, government bond yields still went up over the month. Tightening expectations fell even more significantly in Europe, with expected rate hikes reduced 60-90 bps across the ECB, Swedish and Norwegian central banks. Whether or not this is warranted remains to be seen, emphasizing, once again, the importance of central bank policy outcomes for the months ahead. × DISPLAY 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date  Note: USD-based performance.

Data as of June 30, 2022. The indexes are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. See below for index definitions. Credit markets did not like either scenario (inflation or recession) so underperformed the whole month: U.S. IG spreads widened 25bps while U.S. HY spreads widened 163bps. European bonds did even worse with governments tracking Treasuries weaker and European corporates doing worse.2 The European energy crisis continues to drive inflation higher, with no respite in sight, leaving the European Central Bank (ECB) with little room to maneuver. However, recession fears came to dominate inflation worries and despite inflation making new highs in Europe (and likely to continue to do so over the third quarter) German 2-year yields fell 58bps over the second half of June, mirroring U.S. Treasury performance. The roller coaster is keeping volatility high. The collapse in commodity prices in recent weeks reflects market sentiment shifting away from inflation hedges and towards growth hedges (government bonds). The market now prices inflation will be back below 2% by 2025 in both the Eurozone and the U.S. For the first time this year, government bonds began to behave as a hedge to cyclical risk, with developed market government bonds rallying as credit markets sold off. Of course, this improved performance hinges critically on reduced central bank hawkishness, leading to investors pricing less rate hikes across the yield curve. Whether or not this is justified remains to be seen as core inflation has yet to convincingly peak and turn down. No doubt, the significant drop in commodity prices (assuming it persists) should reduce headline inflation in coming months (outside of Europe) and also, perversely for the economic pessimists, boost consumer and business sentiment, reducing the probability of recession. × DISPLAY 2: Currency Monthly Changes Versus U.S. Dollar  Note: Positive change means appreciation of the currency against the USD.

Fixed Income Outlook June market performance emphasized once again the unusual time we live in. Volatility continues at levels rarely seen over the last two decades, with markets zigging and zagging between inflation and recession fears. Clarity remains lacking as to where economies and markets will eventually end up, but we do know some things. Despite fears of recession, the U.S. labor market and household income growth remain solid. June’s labor market report released on July 8th emphasized the continuing strength and resiliency of job growth. Indeed, no recession is imminent with monthly job growth of 300,000+. As a comparison, for the decade 2010-2019, U.S. job growth averaged less than 200,000 per month. Job growth, which further squeezes a tight labour market, will, we believe, make it very difficult for inflation to come down. Moreover, to slow inflation meaningfully, real rates need to rise. While they have risen substantially from the beginning of the year, it is not yet obvious, despite weakening data, that they are high enough to slow wage growth and the housing market, two key drivers of core inflation. The market’s fading of the Fed’s “dot plot” peak of the Fed funds rate and the fading of inflation risk (falling forward inflation rates) is ambitious to say the least. Falling inflation means growth slows below trend and unemployment rates rise. So far, the growth slowdown could just be a midcycle adjustment from unsustainably rapid growth in 2021 (in both nominal and real terms). It is also possible that inflation remains elevated if the economy is weakened; i.e, a stagflationary scenario, which means the Fed is reluctant to stop tightening. As such it is premature to believe the slowdown occurring will continue or be significant enough to return inflation to the Fed’s target. Inflation could be stickier than the market thinks. Similar situations exist in Europe and Asia. While we may see inflation peak this summer, in year-on-year terms, it implies the Fed is unlikely to ease as fast as market optimism suggests (2023 rate cuts). Moreover, although economic conditions look more challenging for Europe given the energy situation, the dramatic repricing of rate hikes (lower) in June also looks aggressive. Inflation in Europe shows no sign of peaking (even if most of the rise is due to supply chain/energy issues). Unless the Eurozone economy slips into recession, market forecasts of less ECB rate hikes look premature, which will likely put upward pressure on European bond yields as well. Central banks are hawkish for a reason. Inflation in most emerging markets continue to make new highs, even though they began raising rates sooner than advanced economy central bankers. This may imply that there is more tightening to come in advanced economies rather than suggesting EM central banks are nearly done. Despite evidence that growth in manufacturing has slowed significantly, the service sector of economies, as evidenced by June’s Institute for Supply Management service sector report, remains in strong expansionary territory. Anecdotal evidence from the travel industry still points to robust pent-up demand for consumer services alongside labor shortages, suggesting service sector inflation will be hard to suppress. If Covid does not come back to derail this recovery, it will be a challenge for disinflation in the goods sectors to be powerful enough to lower inflation sufficiently to halt central bank tightening anytime soon. On the positive side, there is evidence that supply chain logistics are improving, albeit slowly, which should bode well for improved access to goods and lower prices. Corporate bond performance is also likely to be volatile. Both IG and HY markets reflect expectations that bad news will continue to arrive (weaker earnings, weaker economy, tighter monetary policy). Spreads have moved above the levels normally associated with a healthy economy, meaning they price in a meaningful probability of a recession relatively soon. But there is unlikely to be a recession this year, given the momentum in labor markets and healthy household and corporate balance sheets, implying that credit markets are undervalued relative to current fundamentals. But increasingly restrictive monetary policy means growth will continue to be under pressure. Q2/Q3 reporting will be key in understanding the robustness of business models to input cost inflation and a slowing economy. We continue to be cautiously optimistic on credit given the cheap to current fundamentals but our expectation of deterioration. We still think a soft landing is likely (although less likely than three months ago) with supply chains improving, commodity prices down and central banks not rushing to raise rates once neutral/slightly restrictive levels are achieved. Emerging Markets continue to struggle, but opportunities are arising as there are now countries that price in meaningfully probability of default where we believe it is unwarranted. While EM is likely to struggle as long central banks remain on their current hawkish trajectory and inflation stays high, valuations increasingly price in a highly negative outcome. With risk premiums now generous in some countries, we will look to opportunistically buy, but the asset class still lacks a catalyst to spark a rally. The U.S. dollar, usually a good barometer of the economic and financial outlook, continues to flash warning signs. It tends to be strong when things are going wrong and there is meaningful downside risk, or when things are too good, inflation is high, and economies need to slow. Well, currently these are the two scenarios most priced into financial markets, meaning the dollar goes up continually. A soft landing, slower growth, lower inflation, no recession is the scenario where the dollar is likely to fall from its clearly lofty levels. While that remains our baseline scenario, it remains a hope rather than a fact. In summary, portfolio positioning remains cautious. Valuations are more attractive, opportunistic buying makes sense, but risks remain, mostly on the inflation front and central bank reactions to it. We continue to fear inflation more than recession. Developed Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW Developed market rates were exceptionally volatile in June as the market responded to continued upside inflation surprises, hawkish central banks but then also weaker economic growth data. Initially, rates climbed sharply in response to central banks raising rates more than expected and promising to continue tightening. However, weaker economic activity data then caused yields to fall in the second half of the month as central bank expectations moderated, although 10y government bond yields still ended the month 10-20bps higher. Given higher rates and growth concerns, risk assets in general performed poorly. Medium term inflation breakevens fell below central bank target levels even though inflationary pressures remain strong.3 OUTLOOK Given that inflation has yet to disappear despite growing recessionary concerns, the focus remains on central banks: how aggressively and for how long will they keep hiking? Their current rhetoric remains hawkish, but this may change if economic growth slows further. Overall, we see developed market rates remaining volatile given the uncertainty but expect yields to trend higher as long as recession is avoided. Emerging Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW The selloff in emerging markets debt (EMD) continued through the month. The corporate index within the EMD universe was the best performing, although notably negative during the period. Investors are beginning to more seriously consider the potential for recession in the near term and EMD markets will not be spared.4 OUTLOOK We are optimistic on EMD as valuations appear to be compensating investors generously for the risks. The macroeconomic environment is challenging for all areas of capital markets, but it appears EM investors have already priced this more than most. Inflationary pressures, and corresponding central bank reactions, remain the most important factor for the asset class among other factors such as commodity prices, the evolving effects of the war in Ukraine, and China’s zero-Covid policy. We expect markets to place an emphasis on differentiation amongst countries and credits. Corporate Credit MONTHLY REVIEW The May-end rally proved transitory, and weakness returned in June. The Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Index and the Bloomberg European Aggregate Corporate Index both widened over the month. Energy, equities, and commodities finished lower, reflecting the increased expectations of recession/economic slowdown. News continued to be dominated by a deterioration in fundamental expectations.5 Concerns over elevated inflation, the aggressive policy response and rhetoric central banks and growing recession fears contributed to the second worst one-month return for high yield in more than 10 years, second only to March of 2020. The June spread widening was second only June 2008, according to JPMorgan.6 Global convertibles fell for the eighth consecutive month in June, as the dual threats of rising inflation and looming recession spooked global markets. As the convertible market has shifted down steadily, bonds are now sitting on bond floors and accordingly asset class performance in June was more in line with credit than equities in a risk-off month: the Refinitiv Global Convertibles Focus Index was down compared to MSCI Global equities and the Bloomberg Global Credit index.7 The senior corporate loan market also sank in June, though it remained strong relative to other asset classes.8 OUTLOOK Looking forward we see investment grade spreads offering attractive valuations that are inconsistent with the fundamentals we see at the individual firm level. Potential catalysts for a rally include Q2 results which confirm issuer performance is stronger than market pricing suggests, or a change in macro sentiment where the risk of a recession is reduced. We remain cautious on the U.S. high-yield market as we enter the third quarter of 2022. Volatility across risk markets has continued to increase and there is little to suggest the environment for high yield will be become materially more supportive over the near-term. While we have continued conviction in the loan market’s relatively healthy credit picture, the geopolitical situation in Europe clouds the outlook. Securitized Products MONTHLY REVIEW Recession fears caused securitized credit spreads to widen further in June across all mortgage and securitized products, and demand remains tepid overall. Supply is also tapering off as new loan origination slows, and secondary trading activity has also declined. Agency MBS spreads widened further in June and have now widened in 5 of the 6 months in 2022. U.S. Non-agency RMBS, CMBS and ABS spreads all widened substantially again in June, but fundamental credit performance remains healthy overall. European securitized markets spreads also widened though the housing market remains strong.9 OUTLOOK Credit spreads for many securitized sectors have returned to levels last seen at the depths of the pandemic, but credit conditions are materially better today. We believe the majority of spread widening is due to supply-demand dynamics, with near record Q1 issuance and tepid demand, due to interest rates rising, rather than fundamental credit concerns. We remain constructive on securitized credit and believe sector and security selection will become more important in the coming years if the economy softens. × The views and opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Management team as of June 2022 and are subject to change based on market, economic and other conditions.

There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. × Global Fixed Income Team Our fixed income investment capabilities are driven by eight specialized teams – Agency MBS, Emerging Markets, Floating-Rate Loans, High Yield, Investment Grade Credit, Municipals, Multi-Sector, and Securitized – which span the global fixed income capital markets.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and that the value of Portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Privately placed and restricted securities may be subject to resale restrictions as well as a lack of publicly available information, which will increase their illiquidity and could adversely affect the ability to value and sell them (liquidity risk). Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities (liquidity risk). ESG Strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. Cryptocurrency (notably, Bitcoin) operates as a decentralized, peer-to-peer financial exchange and value storage that is used like money. It is not backed by any government. Federal, state or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency may experience very high volatility.

"Multi-manager platforms are experiencing a surge in investor interest. Consider this excerpt from a January 30, 2022, Bloomberg article: “Investors are plowing money into funds that don’t rely on the next macro genius or star stockpicker, but instead offer an army of traders who invest in an array of strategies. These behemoths secured pretty much all of the new money in the hedge fund industry last year, cementing a tectonic shift that’s accelerated since the pandemic.”1 × Why are these vehicles attracting so many investors? How do they compare with traditional hedge funds? What should investors consider if they are interested in them? We tackle these and other fundamental questions about multi-manager platforms in the following FAQ. 1. What are multi-manager platform hedge funds? Multi-PM hedge funds, hedge fund platforms, or Multi-Manager Platforms (“Multi-PM” or “MMPs”) are investment organizations that employ many specialized hedge fund managers and strategies, collectively operating as one entity, where individual units have discrete P&amp;L responsibilities. Multi-PMs share several characteristics: They are investment vehicles in which the manager oversees a number of independent portfolio management and trading teams. Multi-PMs are responsible for integrating risks and overseeing all operational activities, even though decision-making can be centralized or decentralized, and the investment approach can be coordinated or free standing. Many are designed as all-weather investments, seeking to deliver absolute return and attractive risk-adjusted returns throughout almost any market environment. Some, less concerned about neutrality, seek to concentrate the best ideas into a mix of bottoms-up/top-down portfolio construction methodology. Others apply thematic tilts to the portfolio, trying to take advantage of investment trends, momentum or short-term market moves. Multi-PM platforms deploy capital across many multi-asset opportunities, including a wide variety of fundamental and quantitative strategies. They manage the risks generated by the underlying investment teams, relying on substantial investments in technology and expert teams of investment and IT professionals. 2. Broadly speaking, what are the potential advantages for the client of a Multi-PM platform over the traditional, single-manager hedge fund? Managers of traditional hedge funds are typically sophisticated specialists and gifted investors, employing any of almost three dozen strategies, as defined and classified by organizations such as Hedge Fund Research, Eurekahedge, or Preqin. Investors must not only select which hedge fund strategy is best for the prevailing environment, but also which manager is best positioned to execute the strategy. Consequently, single-manager funds tend to carry net exposures and trading betas associated with their particular strategy. More often they are amplified forms of the manager’s investment views, leading to highly correlated ideas and holdings. In many cases, portfolio construction and risk management tend not to be as sophisticated as their core investment management expertise. A multi-manager platform offers a range of diversified alpha sources and centralizes the risk management function. The independent managers are thus free to put their talents to their highest and best use. The platform manager devotes a comparable level of expertise to managing risk, ensuring, for example, that all unwanted exposures are hedged and that the independent investment managers are within risk budget guidelines. Simply put, many Multi-PM funds consistently deliver their investment objective and target volatility. 3. Broadly speaking what are the potential disadvantages? Multi-PM platforms are operationally complex structures that demand a wide range of capabilities from the platform manager, which entails a high-level commitment of time, resources and expertise. The platform manager must be able to attract and retain multiple talented investment teams, allocate assets, and establish and enforce risk budgets. They must hedge the overall risk exposure of the independent managers and minimize the correlation of their performance. Multi-PMs must also manage high turnover rates while sourcing specialists and developing talent. Thus, investor due diligence of Multi-PMs must take into account skillsets and infrastructure that in many ways are markedly different from single-fund managers. The same is true when considering different Multi-PMs and assessing the likelihood of consistent alpha generation. Moreover, the due diligence task is sometimes hindered by inconsistent or obscure reporting, limited investment transparency, and fee opacity. 4. How many of these sophisticated specialist investors are there and how big is the universe? There are 8,000 hedge fund managers, according to Preqin, a leading provider of hedge fund intelligence, and in the same AIMA headcount study,2 it was estimated in North America that there are 78,500 hedge fund employees with an average number of 19.7 employees per fund manager. Estimated employees in Europe and Asia Pacific were 21,000 and 11,700, respectively. Typically hedge funds are evenly split between investment and non-investment professionals, suggesting 55,600 in the total hedge fund talent pool. However, this broad population represents all hedge fund strategies and not the narrower set the Multi-PM platforms employ. Focusing on just Multi-PMs, we believe there are roughly 9,500 investment professionals across more than 30 firms worldwide. Both the quantity and quality of trading talent have grown with the strategy. From 2008 to 2021, Multi-PMs expanded almost 50% faster than the industry3 and during this period more and more investment professionals learned to hone their skills, making them attractive to this style of investing. Right now the universe of trading talent has never been larger. × Display 1: A Rising Tide  Source: eVestment. As of January 31, 2022. Note: Data rebased to 100.

What evidence is there that the Multi-PM structure has outperformed traditional single-manager hedge fund? For the 10 years ended April 30, 2022, a Multi-PM Peer Group Composite,4 comprised of 32 members, had an annual average return of 8.57% vs. 5.10% for traditional hedge funds, with about half the volatility (See Display 2). Even though this Multi-PM Peer Group Composite outperformed the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index by 3.47%, Multi-PMs, with their lower beta and tighter risk management, collectively generated more than 7.1% of annualized alpha when compared to the HFRI index, over the same period (See Display 3). × Display 2: Multi-PM Platforms Have Delivered Stronger Risk-Adjusted Returns Than Hedge Funds  Source: MSIM AIP Hedge Fund Solutions.

What evidence is there that Multi-PMs are achieving a significant degree of market neutrality? A. Using the same 10 years ended April 30, 2022, the correlation of the Multi-PM Peer Group Composite to the S&amp;P 500 Index is 0.37 vs. HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index of 0.85. Market sensitivity, as measured in terms of beta to the S&amp;P 500 Index, is 0.08 vs. 0.38, respectively. Alternatively, and one of the more compelling ways to show market neutrality, is to view the results during some of the worst down-market periods. Looking at the aggregate (equal weighted average) returns of the Multi-PM Peer Group Composite, one can almost see a wave of positive and negative results, oscillating around zero (See Display 4). × Display 4: Multi-Manager Platforms Have Held Up Well Through S&amp;P 500 Downturns  Source: MSIM AIP Hedge Fund Solutions. As of April 30, 2022. × Display 4: Multi-Manager Platforms Have Held Up Well Through S&amp;P 500 Downturns Source: MSIM AIP Hedge Fund Solutions. As of April 30, 2022. B. Another straightforward way to assess market risk mitigation is to look at the average result when markets are down. Display 5 shows the average return of the Multi-PM Peer Group Composite during every period the S&amp;P 500 index was negative. This is sometimes called “downside capture.” × Display 5: On Average, Multi-Manager Platforms Gained During S&amp;P 500 Downturns  Source: MSIM AIP Hedge Fund Solutions.

Finally, a bit more technical, if you analyze each return of the Multi-PM Peer Group Composite relative to the market, distinguishing between up markets and down markets on the x-axis, you can see no discernible pattern. But a regression analysis reveals that during down markets (the red dots), the beta of the Multi-PM Peer Group Composite to the S&amp;P 500 is close to zero, with a modest upward slope (0.06). Similarly, during positive markets, (the green dots), the beta follows a similar upward slope (0.07). The level of market neutrality in both down and up markets can be denoted in the R-Squared statistic.5 In down markets the R-Squared is 7.4%and in up markets 5.7%, suggesting less than 10% of the market explains Multi-PM’s returns (See Display 6). × Display 6: Multi-PMs Have a Low R-Squared With the Market  Source: MSIM AIP Hedge Fund Solutions. As of April 30, 2022. × Display 6: Multi-PMs Have a Low R-Squared With the Market Source: MSIM AIP Hedge Fund Solutions. As of April 30, 2022. 7. How is market neutrality integral to both portfolio construction and risk management? The goals of market neutrality and generating pure alpha are two sides of the same coin: Both seek to avoid or mitigate unwanted market risk. The two goals shape every aspect of a multi-manager platform, from the selection and onboarding of investment teams to the platform manager’s intricate hedging protocols. Some of the more advanced platforms seek to manage and, through controlled processes, reinforce diversification. By actively monitoring and separating overlapping risks while concurrently engineering steps to promote low correlations, portfolio construction and risk management merge. Perhaps obvious, there are tried and true approaches that ensure tight risk management and low correlations and limit market exposures. CURATED DIVERSE UNIVERSES AND RISK GUIDELINES FOR PM TEAMS — Fundamental long/short equity managers are selected for their expertise within any of the major Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sectors or sub-sectors. The more selective platforms can partition the PM’s trading universes and establish bespoke risk guidelines, whereas others can have multiple teams in the same sector and simply employ monolithic down-and-out risk management rules. Quant strategies are diversified across time horizons, with dollar volume and VaR limits. Many factors, such as the size and philosophy of the manager, the heterogeneity of industry risk, and the number of key return drivers, as well as the sector’s native levels of active risk or total trading volumes, can influence how the platform manager decides on maintaining neutrality. MINIMIZATION OF INTER-MANAGER CORRELATION — The platform manager monitors potential overlaps among country/industry/style risk factors and seeks to identify and mitigate “crowded” trades. Quant strategies, especially the ones with short horizons, tend to have low correlations to market risks and the ability to adapt quickly to rapidly changing trading environments. But surveillance without action tends to be a passive form of risk management. The more advanced platforms employ live oversight of risk budgets for the independent managers and provide real-time feedback to enhance risk management, and also reserve the right to exercise their at-the-touch liquidity, should it be needed. CENTRALIZED TRADING PORTFOLIOS AND RISK LIMIT ENFORCEMENT — Most platform managers construct a dedicated portfolio to hedge unwanted risk factors through overlays. Market and industry risks can be offset in blunt fashion with futures or sector ETFs whereas factor risk reduction can be accomplished by trading efficient baskets of stocks. For quant oversight, limits for each PM tend to be enforced based on target dollar volatility and volatility-based drawdown triggers. Limits on gross and net dollar exposure, and position concentration as a percent of trading levels, provide bright-line tests for the platform manager to enforce daily. The bottom line is that market neutrality ensures, to the greatest extent possible, that investors are paying only for active risk, not for beta or factor exposures that are easily—and cheaply—replicated in numerous other investments. 8. How does a platform manager ensure that expenses are minimized and that the firm’s incentives are aligned with the investors’? Multi-PMs fees are generally higher and involve variations on the classic hedge fund 2%/20% fee structure because of the two differing levels of management involved. One level of competitive compensation is required to attract and retain the underlying trading teams akin to the 2%/20% model. Additionally, the platform manager who oversees the entire infrastructure and operation, while managing the overall risk and fund administration is compensated. Good platform managers invest heavily in the business, personnel and technology. For investors, the payoff should be reflected in the after-fee performance of the Multi-PM, and we believe this value proposition is reflected in the Multi-PM track record (See Display 2). The complementary skills of the platform manager and the independent managers more than compensate for the total fees, and have generated more alpha, on average, than a single-manager fund. Platform managers can, and should, do everything possible to align incentives of their managers with investors, with some of the more innovative managers embedding performance hurdles in their fee structures. Such structures shift a portion of the fixed management fees to fees that are charged to investors only when earned by performance. We have seen newer entrants challenge the open-ended structure with some success. 9. What are the strengths to look for in a platform manager? To attract the best talent in a highly competitive environment, platform managers need to stand out as the “partner of choice” for independent managers. We believe the most attractive platforms offer the independent manager’s risk-taking autonomy combined with a strong franchise that has a global reach, backed by organizational stability and limited business risk. Investors need assurance that the platform manager views them as partners, investing alongside them, with a cost infrastructure optimized to maximize their return. In this context, “franchise strength” means the willingness to negotiate competitive terms with independent managers, vendors and service providers for the benefit of investors. Investors deserve a partner that is a fiduciary committed to the highest standards and institutional responsibilities. This includes comprehensive reporting and providing enough transparency or access to key decision makers to understand not just how alpha is being generated, but why it is likely to persist. 10. Why are multi-manager platforms particularly timely in today’s environment? Hedging unwanted market exposure has always been key to protecting alpha, but doing so has become more complicated and nuanced. For example, the impact of “risk on/ risk off” episodes in the pre-pandemic world usually was effectively hedged with the S&amp;P 500 Index, largely because factors like growth, momentum and value had reasonably consistent—and predictable— performance during such periods. But the same has not held in a post- COVID environment. Investors have had to rapidly switch between the prospects of the economy opening up and shutting down, and the related impact on stocks from labor shortages, supply-chain dynamics and so forth. Such considerations have only increased with the U.S. Fed’s withdrawal of liquidity and inflation-fighting rate increases amid the Russia/Ukraine conflict. Performance factors have undergone large shifts in direction and magnitude, and as a result, the S&amp;P 500 Index has become too blunt a tool for hedging. Factor exposures associated with hedge funds have been behaving very differently under the surface of daily market moves. This evolution of risk led to underperformance of many traditional hedge funds in 2021 and Q1 2022 compared with Multi-PM hedge funds, which are structurally better equipped to identify complicated changes in factor performance and keep hedging techniques up to date. × Conclusion Multi-manager platforms share with traditional hedge funds the potential to generate alpha and a return profile that is uncorrelated with major asset classes or performance factors. But they also add a level of diversified alpha sources and sophisticated risk management that is difficult for many hedge funds to match. If this description fits your portfolio objectives, we believe multi-manager platforms deserve your consideration. × 1 Source: Bloomberg, “An Army of Faceless Suits is Taking Over the $4 Trillion Hedge Fund World,” January 30, 2022, Nishant Kumar 2 Source: https://www.aima.org/educate/hedge-fund-industry-data.html.

"As investors seek to diversify their portfolio exposures beyond traditional assets, alternative lending may offer attractive absolute and risk-adjusted return characteristics. An allocation to alternative lending may provide investors with exposure to a secular shift in the way consumers and small businesses access capital. In this paper, we provide insights on this asset class and discuss why we view it as a through-the-cycle allocation for well-balanced portfolios. × What Is Alternative Lending? Alternately referred to as marketplace lending, peer-to-peer lending and P2P lending, alternative lending takes place through online platforms that use technology to bring together borrowers underserved by traditional lending institutions, with loan investors seeking attractive yield-generating investments. The lending model grew out of small-balance, peer-to-peer unsecured consumer loans financed by individual investors. As the asset class matured, alternative lending evolved so that most loans are funded today by institutional investors, a group that counterintuitively includes even banks.1 Recognizing their technological and geographic constraints, community banks may focus on their core competency of deposit gathering while outsourcing credit underwriting and servicing to alternative lending platforms. Credit risks underwritten by alternative lenders have expanded over time, beyond the unsecured consumer, to include small businesses, autos, commercial and residential real estate, receivables, student loans and other forms of specialty finance. How Does it Work? Consumer borrowers may seek alternative loans for a variety of reasons, including for debt consolidation or to pay down revolving credit card balances. By moving from a revolving structure to an amortizing installment structure, consumer borrowers may benefit from a lower interest rate than would be charged on a comparable revolving balance, such as from a credit card. Alternative lending platforms seek to streamline the traditional lending process by bringing borrowers and loan investors together, and by using technology-enabled models to rapidly underwrite borrower credit risk when determining appropriate loan pricing, terms and amounts offered to borrowers. When borrowers accept loan offers, investors may purchase the loans post-issuance, for example, by actively selecting loans that they wish to purchase or by taking passive pro rata2 allocations of loans that meet prespecified criteria, considering loan type, size, term, duration, credit risk, geographic concentration, etc. Investors largely obtain the potential economic benefits and risks stemming from the loans, but the platforms typically maintain the customer relationship with end-borrowers and act as servicers for the loans, sending cash flows from the borrowers to the investors, net of servicing fees. The platforms also may charge loan origination fees, typically to the borrowers. Platforms may use partner banks to formally originate the loans they underwrite. The partner banks typically conduct oversight on the platforms’ underwriting models and ensure that underwritten loans and servicing procedures comply with applicable laws. In some cases, the partner banks or platforms may maintain an economic interest in loans sold to investors. The loans themselves generally have relatively low initial balances, and terms of three to five years are typical. Today the most common consumer unsecured alternative loan is fully amortizing, with a weighted average term3 of roughly 3.5 years and an average balance of roughly $10,043.4 × DISPLAY 1Alternative Lending Model  × DISPLAY 1Alternative Lending Model The Evolution of Alternative Lending Alternative lending grew rapidly in the decade following the first peer-to-peer online loans underwritten in the U.K. in 2005 and in the U.S. in 2006, gathering pace in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis.5 These small-volume credit experiments leveraged marketplace models alongside technology-enabled customer acquisition, underwriting and loan servicing geared to borrowers who had grown comfortable with online services. Alternative lending volumes scaled as the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis drove bank retrenchment from consumer and small-business lending, and as new regulations increased the cost of capital for traditional banks, stressing the traditional banking model. To facilitate burgeoning loan volumes, alternative lending platforms evolved their funding models from the original peer-to-peer format to institutional buyers serving as the predominant loan investors, purchasing portfolios of loans in bulk. Hedge funds were early buyers, actively selecting individual loans that they expected would outperform the platforms’ average underwriting. As the platform underwriting models matured and the opportunities for hedge fund alpha6 generation declined, institutional buyers largely migrated to passive pro rata purchases of loans within each buyer’s defined credit box. Passive pro rata allocations moved the due diligence focus for loan purchasers from individual, small-balance loans to all the loans underwritten by a platform within a purchaser’s defined credit box, as well as to the platforms themselves. Passive allocations also facilitated deeper integration with the capital markets. The first securitization backed by unsecured consumer alternative loans occurred in 2013, and the first rated securitization of those loans followed in 2015. U.S. consumer and small-business alternative lending platforms first listed their shares publicly in 2014. The first registered alternative lending fund launched in the U.S. in 2016. In 2021, Morgan Stanley Research estimated nearly $15.3 billion of asset-backed security issuance by the marketplace lending sector. Issuance increased materially as compared to FY 2020 volume of approximately $10 billion.7 YTD 2022 through April, asset-backed security issuance by the marketplace lending sector totaled approximately $3.7 billion, outpacing 2021 YTD issuance for the same time period.8 × DISPLAY 2Evolution of Alternative Lending  * “The Hourglass Effect: A Decade of Displacement,” QED Investors, Frank Rotman, April 13, 2015; AIP Alternative Lending Group research. ** AIP Alternative Lending Group.

June 1, 2022. Why Is the Opportunity Compelling Today? In our view, there are four main reasons why alternative lending may be a compelling strategy for investors: Alternative lending may provide a potential combination of attractive yield and low duration that stands in sharp contrast to the traditional fixed income universe. Alternative lending’s relatively low duration may reduce sensitivity to changes in benchmark interest rates. One contributor to low duration is the amortizing structure typical of alternative loans, which may facilitate vintage diversification9 that may be challenging to achieve with traditional fixed income that only repays principal at maturity. Furthermore, alternative lending may offer outsized credit spreads,10 gross of any defaults and recoveries. While alternative loans often are unsecured, meaning, defaults typically will be higher and recoveries lower than with traditional fixed income, we believe that alternative lending’s outsized credit spreads may provide a cushion against realized principal loss when investors encounter adverse economic environments, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or experienced during the Global Financial Crisis. Unsecured consumer alternative lending may be diversifying versus other major asset classes, including traditional corporate credit. Alternative lending’s underlying credit exposure often stems from the consumer, rather than from corporate or government credit exposure that generally dominates traditional fixed income allocations. Unsecured consumer alternative lending exhibited fundamental resilience through the COVID crisis. In response to COVID-induced economic shutdowns, alternative lending platforms tightened credit standards, decreasing underwriting volumes and increasing borrower selectivity, and they increased borrower interest rates. They also offered short-term loan modification programs to impacted borrowers, which likely reduced borrower defaults as the economic backdrop stabilized. Alternative lending reflects a diversified opportunity set. Indeed, the volume and variety of strategies have flourished in recent years, providing multiple axes for diversification (e.g., by loan segment, credit quality, geography, security interest, balance size and/or loan duration). × DISPLAY 3Diversified Opportunity Set  For illustrative purposes only.

The statements above reflect the opinions and views of AIP Alternative Lending Group as of the date hereof and not as of any future date, and will not be updated or supplemented. Conclusion While ramping inflation is negatively impacting U.S. consumer confidence, we believe that alternative lending’s modest duration may limit direct interest rate sensitivity should the Fed continue to hike interest rates as significantly as market participants expect. As a primarily consumer-focused private credit opportunity, we believe that alternative lending can diversify investor’s traditional and private corporate credit allocations.

"Economist Pippa Malmgren has been credited for coining the term “shrinkflation”, meaning, in its most common usage, when a company reduces a product’s size while maintaining its price. A less common usage of this term may refer to the pertinent macroeconomic situation where the economy is contracting while also experiencing a rising price level, perhaps better known as stagflation. Against a backdrop of rising rates and inflation, markets are shrinking too, in stark contrast to the cost of living. March U.S. consumer price index data took the annual rate of inflation to 8.5%, its highest since December 1981. × "" Shrinkflation is an increasingly common response by companies to inflation – fewer sheets per roll, fewer caplets per bottle, fewer washes per box Inflation so far has been driven by “stuff”, as there has been a shortage of goods and commodities as economies have bounced back fast from the COVID-19 crisis, given the combination of massive government support and the vaccine miracle, in developed markets at least. This has then been aggravated by further supply shocks in food and energy, owing to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and may be made worse still if COVID-19 shutdowns affect Chinese production. The question from here is whether the inflation leaks from “stuff” to “staff”, with rising wage settlements in a tight labour market, and jobs easy to find and hard to fill. U.S. wage growth has accelerated to 5%,1 the highest seen so far this century, though still behind the consumer inflation rate, implying falling real wages. Ultimately, there is a bit of a Catch-22 for companies — either wages rise, potentially squeezing corporates’ margins; or they don’t, threatening real wage falls that could hurt consumption and thus corporates’ top-line sales. Shrinkflation is an increasingly common response by companies to inflation — fewer sheets per roll, fewer caplets per bottle, fewer washes per box. Brands quietly downsize their products without decreasing prices accordingly, to maintain or boost profits as they try to navigate increases in the cost of materials, labour, energy, packaging and transport, or to maintain market share in the face of stiffer competition for every dollar. The service sector is not immune, with hotel chains making guests opt in to daily room cleaning and not rushing to restore breakfast service post-pandemic. Customers are typically more sensitive to price over contents, and “improved” formulations in a rebranded or repackaged (read smaller) bag are perceived less negatively or barely noticed. However, companies need to be careful of consumer backlash and cannot afford to shrink their products repeatedly or they risk losing consumer trust. In fact, in a world of social media and an emphasis on integrity, shrinkflating companies in 2022 are more likely to need to explain their downsized offerings. So far, company earnings forecasts are proving largely immune to these fears. MSCI World Index 12-month forward earnings estimates are up 6%2 so far this year, as companies enjoy the inflationary impact on revenues without taking margin pain … yet. Indeed, EBIT3 margins remain at extremely elevated levels, approaching 17% for the MSCI World Index, versus the pre-pandemic peak of 15% and the 20-year average of 13.4%.2 These stretched margins have to be under threat, either from the inflation itself or any slowdown caused by the attempts to tackle the inflation. One key to navigating this environment as an investor is to focus on companies with robust fundamentals that enjoy pricing power — the ability to pass on input costs, be they stuff or staff — to consumers. Staples companies that sell essential products can even increase prices in this tough environment. For example, a multinational consumer hygiene company we hold reported that its strong portfolio of brands has allowed for “responsible price action”, i.e. an increase in pricing of 5% in the first quarter across its business, while a Dutch brewing company we own managed double-digit “price mix” in the first quarter, as it passed on costs, helped by the return to bars and restaurants in Europe. This contrasts with the fortunes of general retailers (which we don’t own), which have suffered the mistake of increasing their inventory of home equipment at a time when a post-pandemic consumer is shifting towards leisure and services outside the home. Mission-critical software-on-subscription models also enjoy fortress-like pricing power and recurring revenues, as an American technology company proved with its announced price increases for commercial products that took effect 1 March 2022. Typically, such announcements are softened with reference to innovative improvements, for example new artificial intelligence tools or enhanced security being included in the price. Payments companies, which take a clip of every dollar in a rising inflation environment, gaining revenue without having to increase prices, are often overlooked inflation plays — never mind that they have been able to effect increases in merchant fees. Within medtech and life sciences, product mix matters, and in some categories like nutrition, it is easier to effect price increases than in more commoditized areas. Medical and scientific supplies companies enjoy some protection, as hospitals and scientists will continue to prize reliability and quality, raising switching costs. This is particularly the case where the products and services provided are a small part of the customers’ cost base. We started the year very worried about both earnings and multiples. Five months of derating has eased our fears on multiples, though they are not in any way low, as they are still at the top end of their 2003-2019 range — but at least they are no longer a scary 20% above that range. By contrast, our concerns about earnings have continued to rise, along with the earnings themselves, aggravated by the growing risks to the stretched margins from either inflation or a downturn. Given the risks to earnings, it may be a particularly good time to own compounders, i.e. companies that can grow their earnings steadily across cycles because their pricing power and recurring revenue make their earnings resilient in tough times. × 1 Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index, March 2022 2 Source: FactSet 3 Earnings before interest and taxation × Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy’s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. × Bruno Paulson Managing Director International Equity Team Laura Bottega COO and Head of Client Experience, International Equity Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Previous Next",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/shrinkflation.html
"Major Developed Markets were down over the month, with the S&amp;P 500 (TR) (USD) once more faring the worst -8.3%, the MSCI Europe (TR) (EUR) next at -7.7% and MSCI Japan (TR) (JPY) -2.7% 1. Whilst the MSCI EM (USD) was -6.6%, a notable exception was the MSCI China (HKD), up 6.7%1. Despite being the strongest performer in previous months, at -14.2%, the MSCI Energy (USD) represented one of the worst performing sectors this month1. Though the US 10-Year Treasury yield moved above 3% during June, peaking at 3.5%2 , it was back to 3.01%1 by month end, on the back of deteriorating consumer data and growth indicators. × We expect inflation to moderate slowly in the coming 12 months. Even if demand slows in response to high prices as we expect, some components of the CPI such as housing, may prove much stickier because of the lag between the index and rental prices. We expect food CPI to peak during Q3 2022. We remain concerned that a recession is becoming increasingly likely, given high inflation could force a quick pace of hikes in the US and Europe, meaning potentially excessive tightening, especially by the Federal Reserve, just as growth weakens. The end of June saw a number of data releases indicating US consumption is already in sharp decline. Consumer durables dropped in May -3.2% month-on-month3, real disposable income growth was down 0.1% month-on-month[2], and real spending growth at -0.4% month-on-month, was the first decline in real personal consumption expenditure since November 20214. So far, US forward sales and earnings estimates appear to have held up well, but this could turn. Ultimately central banks could end up shifting to a more benign stance in the latter part of 2022. Investment Implications We have kept our broad asset allocation stable, with low equities, having deployed our high cash position last month into fixed income. We made a number of tactical changes over the month, which we have outlined below: China A Equities We moved positive China A equities and are constructive, as the country comes out of lockdowns. The pace of recovery in consumption and private investment still appears muted. However, the economy is supported through increased public infrastructure spending, and easing measures for the residential property market. We expect fiscal stimulus to continue, combined with further cuts to rates and the bank’s reserve requirement ratio (RRR), but at a controlled pace compared with past cycles, to avert fuelling asset bubbles. Valuations appear fair, with forward P/E ratios around 10Y median levels5. We believe Chinese equities should outperform relative to other regions. Indeed, sentiment is picking up, as YTD northbound flows have turned positive6. Global Energy Equities We increased our positive tilt to global energy. As mentioned, supply disruptions due to the Russia-Ukraine war should keep energy elevated and structural trends, such as energy companies’ underinvestment in production and refining capacity, should further support. Based on past recessions, if we move towards a recessionary environment, we expect any hit to demand to be counterbalanced by supply disruptions in Russia and residual pent-up demand as the global economy concludes its reopening phase over the summer. Oil prices have generally been rising despite China lockdowns. However, with China now reopening, we believe that this and residual pent-up demand should offset any hit from slowing growth. Government Bonds Italian Government Bonds We moved underweight Italian government bonds (BTPs) and bought German Bunds and French government bonds (OATs), remaining neutral on the latter two. We view risks to BTP spreads skewed to the downside. The announcement that the European Central Bank (ECB) is designing an anti-fragmentation tool caused a significant tightening in spreads and should allow the ECB to hike rates quicker if needed, with less worry of causing another pickup in peripheral spread volatility. However, as the structure of the anti-fragmentation tool is worked out, we are likely to see some volatility in news flow just as the ECB is set to hike rates. This is still likely to put upward pressure on spreads, and we believe the ECB would allow for a gradual spread widening as a reflection of a tighter monetary stance, if this does not threaten the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Japanese Government Bonds We also moved negative Japanese government bonds (JGBs), adding instead to US Treasuries, as we expect JGBs to underperform relative to cash in the short term and the broader bond universe in the medium term. The Bank of Japan may be forced to relax its Yield Curve Control (YCC) and ultra-loose monetary policy, if inflation expectations and wage growth picks up.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser’s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio’s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio’s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. × Andrew Harmstone Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Manfred Hui Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Select Product(s) Right Click Edit",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/the-central-bank-conundrum-self-inflicted.html
"Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are liquid, publicly-traded companies that offer investors access to high-quality commercial real estate assets with strong growth potential and the unique benefits that come with investing in real assets. REITs own, operate, and develop traditional commercial properties like shopping centers, office buildings and apartment complexes, but also more specialty properties, such as cell towers, self-storage facilities and healthcare clinics. × The listed real estate market evolves and grows with the broader needs of society and the economy—and sits at the epicenter of how people live, work, shop and communicate. We believe there are several compelling reasons for investors to consider an allocation to REITs. REITs typically generate superior yields relative to other investments REITs have a history of producing attractive returns REITs provide diversification benefits in a portfolio of traditional equities and bonds REITs’ inflation-hedging characteristics also make them a particularly attractive investment opportunity today. And for those investors focused on sustainability, certain REITs invest in real estate properties that are helping to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. What is a REIT? U.S. REITs are a tax structure that was formed through Congress in the 1960s as a means of making investing in high-quality commercial real estate accessible to all investors. Broadly, REITs are companies that own commercial real estate, collect rents on that real estate, and then pay that collected rent out in the form of dividends to shareholders. In the U.S., REITs are required to pay out at least 90% of their taxable income—many pay out 100%. Listed real estate companies invest in familiar commercial properties including shopping centers and apartment complexes, as well as properties that are not necessarily top-of-mind, like storage facilities, data centers and cell phone towers. The modern REIT market is continuously evolving to meet the needs of the public and the necessity-based nature of these properties— facilitating commerce, providing shelter, and building the infrastructure of tomorrow—providing insulation to earnings in a way that more discretionary investments cannot. Many other countries, including France, the U.K., Japan, Australia and Canada have also adopted REIT like structures, offering investors access to non U.S. real estate markets as well. × DISPLAY 1: Real Estate Offers Some of the Highest Yields  Source: FactSet for Equity Index Dividend Yield; BlackRock Aladdin for Fixed Income Index Nominal Yield; Bloomberg for 10 Year U.S. Treasury Yield.

The Case for REITs We believe there are several good reasons to invest in REITs: YIELD: Low absolute interest rates continue to add fuel to investors’ search for yield. U.S. and global real estate pay a high yield relative to investable alternatives. In fact, real estate offers some of the highest yields, second only to global high-yield bonds. TOTAL RETURN: Beyond yield, REITs can provide an attractive source of total return.

INFLATION HEDGE: REITS HAVE HISTORICALLY PERFORMED WELL IN INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENTS – Inflation is in the headlines and has become a discernable part of everyday life, with price increases evident at the gas station, grocery store and travel related industries, amongst others. Many businesses—and their stock prices—continue to suffer from increases in the cost of raw materials and wages, especially those businesses where it is difficult to pass on price increases to end consumers. REITs, on the other hand, have some real advantages in inflationary environments. As prices rise, property values tend to appreciate, while cash flow streams also generally benefit. For example, properties with short-term leases, such as hotels, self-storage facilities and apartments, are reset frequently. Landlords then have the ability to adjust rents quickly in reaction to inflationary pressures. Additionally, for those property types with longer-duration leases, such as retail, office and logistics, the investment can often offer inflation protection that is specifically built into the lease (e.g. explicit inflation linked increases). Display 4 shows that REITs have historically posted positive returns in most inflationary environments, to the point where many investors consider real estate a compelling hedge against inflation. × DISPLAY 4: REITs Have Historically Done Well in Inflationary Environments  Source: Sources: Bloomberg Economic Data, Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

Real Estate and “Work-From-Home” – Some Interesting Opportunities The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated and introduced new market dynamics, creating significant and, in many cases, surprising dispersions—and opportunities—for active managers within listed real estate investing. One of the most disruptive impacts the Covid-19 pandemic has had on commercial real estate has been to the office sector. Over the course of the pandemic, work-from-home and hybrid work became the norm, and while the number of Covid cases has dropped globally, a return to office hasn’t increased correspondingly. However, the impact of the return to office has varied significantly city-by-city and country-by-country. Additionally, an increased focus on health, wellness and safety is reversing densification trends witnessed over the past decades and serving as a partial offset to the demand impairment stemming from hybrid work. We are increasingly more constructive on office over the short to intermediate term in light of return to office trends. While the office industry is facing headwinds from lingering secular and cyclical forces, we expect certain secular challenges—specifically, densification trends from shrinking square foot per employee, to reverse; while other challenges—high sustaining capex—will persist. Real Estate and e-Commerce – “Bricks and Mortar” Is Not Dead In the retail real estate world, the explosive growth in e-commerce had shifted demand away from “bricks and mortar” storefronts to warehouses, data centers and logistics. However, coming out of the pandemic, there is now a renewed appreciation for the storefront as retailers rethink the role of the physical store in distribution and, in some cases, brand development. There will likely continue to be square footage rationalization as e-commerce grows, but brick-and-mortar retail will not disappear. The pandemic has underscored the importance of a physical location in a true omnichannel distribution environment and retailers are reinvesting in their stores and looking to sign leases in premium retail centers globally. Sustainability – How REITs Can Make a Difference Businesses, governments and investors are committing to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. This has significant implications for global real estate. According to the United Nations Environment Program, building operations and construction represent 39% of global greenhouse gas emissions. It estimates that direct building carbon emissions will need to be cut in half by 2030 to get on track for 2050, having major implications for real estate landlords, developers and property values. As an investor focused on responsible investing, understanding the key risks and opportunities faced by commercial real estate landlords looking to cut global emissions is top of our mind and fully integrated into our research and investment process. × In Summary We believe there are several compelling reasons to invest in listed real estate over a market cycle, and more importantly, now. These include: Attractive yield potential relative to other investments Ability to generate a compelling total return Portfolio diversification Proven potential to perform well in inflationary environments Enhanced environmental, social and governance investment opportunities × RISK WARNING There are special risk considerations associated with investing in the real estate industry securities such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and the securities of companies principally engaged in the real estate industry. These risks include: the cyclical nature of real estate values, risks related to general and local economic conditions, overbuilding and increased competition, increases in property taxes and operating expenses, demographic trends and variations in rental income, changes in zoning laws, casualty or condemnation losses, environmental risks, regulatory limitations on rents, changes in neighborhood values, related party risks, changes in the appeal of properties to tenants, increases in interest rates and other real estate capital market influences. Generally, increases in interest rates will increase the costs of obtaining financing, which could directly and indirectly decrease the value of a strategy investing in the Real Estate Industry. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. × Laurel Durkay Head of Global Listed Real Assets Global Listed Real Assets Team",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/why-reits-and-why-now.html

"Inflation has emerged as the central macro issue over the past two of years. As most major central banks tighten policy, inflation trajectory will remain key to assessing the likely macro and market outcomes. In this note, we discuss three scenarios for inflation and monetary policy and assess market implications of each. While the dreaded recession scenario is a possibility, we do not see it as the dominant scenario. Higher sustained inflation in the context of slower but resilient economic growth appears to be the more likely one over the next 12-18 months, with mildly negative real returns for major asset classes. Beyond near-term considerations, recent geopolitical developments are likely to lead to accelerated decarbonization, fragmentation of supply chains and looser fiscal policies which raises the probability of inflation remaining higher on a secular basis.

"Containing Inflation The Fed cannot lower inflation and keep it contained within its 2 - 2.5% target all by itself. What is required is coordination between both monetary and fiscal policy in order to sustainably rein in significant inflation risks. These were the tools used to lower and contain inflation in the 1980s and are again necessary to lower inflation to target levels and, most importantly, keep it there. × Supply AND Demand The narrative forwarded today is that the Fed needs to cure the inflation infirmity only through monetary policy, much like the former Fed Chair Paul Volcker did in the 1980s. However, this narrative is only a half-truth because, similar to the 1980s, today’s inflation is being driven by a supply shock as well as an increase in demand. This means that a supply-side response supported by fiscal policy is needed in addition to a monetary policy response, which only serves to decrease demand by increasing the cost of money and credit. It is understood now that the shortages in goods and labor that brought about higher prices and wages were not transitory, but instead resulted in a wage-price spiral that has created persistent inflation risks. These shortages need to be addressed by fiscal policy, namely government spending, regulation and taxation, all designed to increase the productive capacity of the U.S. economy such that supply meets demand. If the Fed relies on raising interest rates alone, it may only succeed at deflating asset valuations. The focus on monetary policy alone might also create a recession, but inflation may remain sticky and bounce even higher once the economy recovers. It is imperative that productive capacity is increased requiring a supply-side policy response. A Lesson From the Volcker Era A common misunderstanding is that aggressive rate hikes by Volcker in the 1980s solved the inflation problem, period. However, a broader and more correct account would indicate that Volcker’s policies created not one, but two, back-to-back and very deep recessions that merely served to “interrupt” the rise in inflation. His actions would not have completely eliminated inflation without corresponding supply-side fiscal policies. Fiscal Policy Is a Must That’s what’s missing today. We need to see a plan for a fiscal policy to work in coordination with monetary policy. Supply and demand need to work together to bring down inflation more permanently. If the Fed goes it alone, then it will be using only a demand tool to fix a supply problem. Unless we see coordinated fiscal and monetary policy, inflation may stick around longer than market consensus suggests. × RISK CONSIDERATIONS. There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. High-yield securities (“junk bonds”) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). × Jim Caron Portfolio Manager and Chief Fixed Income Strategist The Fed Cannot Contain Inflation Alone 06/23/2022",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/the-fed-cannot-contain-inflation-alone-fiscal-policy-is-required.html
"Watching crowds of young men and women masquerading in anime and Hollywood superhero costumes, visitors to Riyadh in March might have forgotten they were in Saudi Arabia. At a time of high oil prices in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Kingdom nears the halfway stage in an ambitious program devised by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a program enacting social and economic reforms designed to wean the economy off its dependence on the oil sector. Foreign investors have poured $9 billion into the Saudi equity market in the first quarter of 2022, exceeding the approximately $7 billion during 2021.1 × The economy grew 9.6% in the first quarter of 2022, the highest growth rate since 2011, driven by a 20% increase in oil sector contributions.2 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates the Saudi economy will expand 7.6% this year, more than double the 3.2% growth recorded in 2021 and for the first time in Saudi Arabia’s history the IMF estimates the GDP to exceed $1 trillion in 2022.3 To be fair, oil prices were already climbing as post-COVID demand returned before the shock of Russia’s invasion propelled prices to levels not seen for around a decade. And as the world’s top oil exporter, Saudi Arabia has benefited from the price hikes. There is a mood of optimism in the Saudi air. Consumer confidence indicators are at all-time highs, where a recent Ipsos survey found that 92% of Saudi respondents thought the country was going in the right direction,4 an overwhelming vote of trust after the Kingdom survived the twin shock of the pandemic and drop in oil demand and prices. Back in 2019, we marveled at the pace of social reforms (“The New Saudi Arabia”), designed to make the country a more attractive place for its own citizens, especially the under 35s who make up more than 50% of the 35 million population,5 and help draw tourists. But we also wondered if the government could seriously make progress to create an economy that was not so reliant on oil sector growth. The fast pace of social reforms has continued. Women are now allowed to drive and work in fields previously only limited to men. In fact, more than 33% of Saudi women now participate in the labor force, a significant surge since 2018.6 Restaurants are no longer required to have partitions separating single men from families and in 2018, for the first time in more than 35 years, commercial cinemas are allowed to operate in the country. In addition, Saudi Arabia has joined the select list of countries hosting a Formula 1 Grand Prix race and entertainers ranging from WWE wrestling stars to Cuban-American rapper Pitbull and Canadian popstar Justin Bieber have performed in front of hundreds of thousands of fans. Oil remains central to the Saudi economy although economic and fiscal reforms have started to show results (Display 1). The country is still reliant on government spending and remains tied to oil price gyrations. Riyadh posted a budget surplus of $15.3 billion in the first three months of 2022, its first surplus in nearly 10 years, after a deficit of 2.7% of GDP last year.7 This surplus accounts for 64% of the projected $24 billion or 2.5% of GDP Riyadh had forecast for this year.8 × Display 1: Saudi Arabia Is Less Reliant on Oil Revenues Oil vs non-oil government revenues, pre and post launch Vision 2030  Source: MSIM, Haver, Saudi Ministry of Finance, Argaam × Display 1: Saudi Arabia Is Less Reliant on Oil Revenues Oil vs non-oil government revenues, pre and post launch Vision 2030 Source: MSIM, Haver, Saudi Ministry of Finance, Argaam Inflation is rising in much of the world to levels not seen for years, but in Saudi Arabia it’s relatively subdued. In fact, the Kingdom has lower inflation than most countries globally and in the emerging markets.9 There are issues though. While the official April CPI was 2.3%, prices on many basic food categories appear to be well over 10%.10 We believe the government has the tools to control inflation, such as reducing the 15% VAT rate or offering citizens cost-of-living allowances to counteract rising food inflation. While we are not sure a demand subsidy will counteract food inflation, both a VAT reduction and cost-of-living allowances should theoretically support Saudi consumption. To move beyond oil, the government is banking on Vision 2030, a plan unveiled by Crown Prince Mohammed in 2016 to restructure the economy and develop tourism and entertainment projects. The government sees tourism as a key element of their reform plan and the single largest source of new jobs. Currently, a huge number of Saudis leave the Kingdom for holidays, spending around $24 billion a year elsewhere.11 If some of that money can be spent locally, that would provide a huge boost to the economy. Critics argue that the progress has been slow in some areas, but things are clearly moving in the right direction. The Public Investment Fund (PIF), the main Saudi sovereign-wealth fund, has invested in a series of mega-projects to develop parts of Riyadh and build new cities and resorts by the Red Sea to boost non-religious tourism. It’s a remarkable change in attitude given that Saudi Arabia didn’t even issue tourist visas until 2019 but these days international travelers can procure an e-visa with a few simple clicks. The most ambitious project is Neom, a $500 billion vision of a new city that aspires to be a luxury resort as well as an innovation hub focused on “industries of the future.” By the end of 2025, Neom anticipates as many as a million visitors arriving for a holiday or a business event - the first hotel is expected to open by the end of 2022. Management expects Neom’s international airport to be operational by 2025 with a capacity of 25 million passengers per year. Beyond tourism, Neom inked a $5 billion green hydrogen plant to come online in 2025, for its first major industrial project. The green projects are part of the plans by the Kingdom to invest $180 billion to cut its carbon emissions to net zero by 2060. The private sector is also starting to do its part as five Saudi corporations, including both the world’s largest oil producer and national airline, have joined the MENA region’s first voluntary carbon market, backed by PIF. North of Jeddah, the Red Sea Tourism Project has secured funding and construction loans. The first phase of the two-phase project includes developing five islands, 16 hotels (including 14 marine resorts) with a total capacity of 3,100 rooms and two resorts, in addition to two yacht marinas, entertainment facilities and an airport. The aim is to host the first guests sometime next year and to complete the project by 2030. Risks to projects are long construction lead times and possible capacity bottlenecks in the contractor sector. One area of focus that has slowed recently is foreign direct investment (FDI), where the global macro backdrop was not supportive due to COVID and low oil prices. The Kingdom had hoped to attract $10 billion in annual inflows but only managed $5.5 billion in 2020.12 Last year, the government announced new plans to attract $100 billion in annual FDI by 2030. Shareek (which means partner) is another prong of the economic reform, designed to drive investments to domestic businesses. Under Shareek, private companies invest a percentage of their profits in local investments, where the goal is to raise the private sector’s share of GDP from 40 percent to 65 percent by 2030. Saudi Arabia still has a lot of work to do to fully achieve the ambitious goals of Vision 2030 and diversify away from oil. The high oil price will ease the pain of the economic reforms that are needed. The targets are ambitious but with strong leadership and a young and educated population a lot can be achieved. × DOWNLOAD TALES FROM THE EMERGING WORLD .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:fit-content; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective.

Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Stocks of small-capitalization companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets, and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more-established companies. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the Portfolio’s performance. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Cryptocurrency (notably, Bitcoin) operates as a decentralized, peer-to-peer financial exchange and value storage that is used like money. It is not backed by any government. Federal, state or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency may experience very high volatility. × 1 Morgan Stanley Research, Bloomberg, Tadawul.

"Markets continue to be buffeted by high levels of volatility driven by shifting fears of recession and inflation. This roller coaster of a month resulted in very diverse financial market performance. In the U.S., the month started off where April ended: higher yields, wider credit spreads, weaker equities as inflation fed tightening fears dominated. But by mid-month, slowdown fears (growth surprises became negative) increased, which pushed yields lower across U.S. Treasuries, reduced rate hike expectations by about 25 basis points (bps) and helped equities rebound. By the end of May, U.S. Treasury 10-year yields were down about 9 bps and the S&amp;P 500 equity index essentially unchanged, after being down almost 6% mid-month. With a more dovish U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) outlook (on the back of growth fears) the U.S. yield curve steepened. × Price action in the rest of the world’s bond markets was not so benign. Yields in Europe rose significantly with German 10-year yields up 18 bps. It was quite noticeable that in countries where monetary policy hawkishness weakened to some degree, bond markets did OK; but in those countries where central bank hawkishness was maintained or intensified, bond yields continued to rise over the month. Inflation data continue to show little signs of slowing sufficiently for central banks to relent on hiking plans. Fed rhetoric remains one of “expeditiously” getting rates normalized while, for example, European Central Bank (ECB) members continue to harp on the need to quickly exit negative interest rate policy. As such, May was unusual in that U.S. rate expectations softened (taking out one anticipated rate hike) relative to those in the rest of the world. The Bank of Canada was particularly forceful in its comments about the need to do “whatever it takes” to get inflation down sooner rather than later. × DISPLAY 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date  Note: USD-based performance.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. See below for index definitions. Perceptions that inflation had peaked, economies were slowing, and the Fed was unlikely to raise rates by more than priced into yield curves gave a fillip to markets, especially once U.S. Treasury yields moved over 3% on May 5, a level perceived to be a bridge too far (for the health of the economy). The mid May rally in U.S. yields was somewhat anomalous, suggesting it is unlikely to continue. During the month, real yields rose as nominal yields fell, implying a decline in inflation expectations. Nominal and real yields are usually highly positively correlated. It is also counterintuitive given the upward pressure seen in commodity prices (particularly oil and food) to think inflation expectations should improve so significantly. As such, we were not surprised that the rally in 10- year U.S. Treasuries ran out of steam around the 2.75% level. These relative central bank assessments drove fixed income returns. U.S. Treasuries and U.S. dollar bonds eked out positive returns for the month, while in general, fixed income returns were negative outside the U.S. High yield corporates continued to sell off, not benefiting as much from an easing of Fed hawkishness. Indeed, while anticipating lower short rates is good for bonds, higher real yields and lower inflation is not for lower quality issuers. Euro-denominated corporate bonds (both IG and HY) put in a very poor performance on the back of increased ECB hawkishness, higher yields and poor inflation data. × DISPLAY 2: Currency Monthly Changes Versus U.S. Dollar  Note: Positive change means appreciation of the currency against the USD.

However, local markets did well, putting in one of the better returns across asset classes as EM currencies strengthened on the back of optimism that peak Fed funds rates were discounted. Another key differentiator has been external conditions whereby commodity exporters have generally benefited from high and rising commodity prices while commodity importers are suffering worsening trade balances. × DISPLAY 3: Major Monthly Changes in 10-Year Yields and Spreads  Source: Bloomberg, JPMorgan.

Fixed Income Outlook Unfortunately, volatility is unlikely to go away. Even though most of the bear market in rates is likely behind us, upward pressure from high (even if falling) inflation and rate hikes will keep bond yields elevated. Central banks are highly likely to deliver what is priced into yield curves. Chairman Powell has reiterated multiple times the need to “normalize” rates “expeditiously.” We take that to mean moving the Fed funds rate to a minimum of 2.5% this year with risks skewed higher. Once the Fed gets rates to the 2.5-2.75% zone, the pace of rate hikes is likely to slow but continue. The extent of the move beyond “normal” will be highly data dependent, meaning how the economy is performing in late summer and early fall. If growth continues to slow; labor markets loosen, softening wage growth. Most importantly, if inflation is moving lower, the Fed can slow the pace of tightening, protecting economic growth. However, it is not clear at all if these conditions will be met. Thus, the concern remains that the probability of the Fed lifting its terminal rate forecast at the June Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is significant, which could easily upset markets. Central banks in general remain on a hawkish trajectory, even those in countries that have already experienced significant rate hikes. New Zealand’s central bank, one of the first to raise rates last year, was expected to announce a slowing or ending of its hiking cycle. Instead, it doubled down, saying overdoing it (in terms of rate hikes) was less risky than doing too little. Similar sentiments appear to be becoming the majority sentiment at the ECB where inflation has continued to surprise to the upside while economic growth has NOT taken as big a hit as was expected pre-Russian invasion of the Ukraine. Expect more hawkish rhetoric and actions by central banks. Central banks are not acting without reason. May data for business confidence, labor markets and consumer spending was resilient. Yes, in some cases like the U.S. Institute for Supply Management (ISM) data, results were weaker than expected, but they remain at robust levels and, we believe, are likely to stay firm as strong labor markets, strong income generation, healthy balance sheets and high savings keep service sector spending strong. It is difficult to see meaningful falls in inflation with economic fundamentals so solid. While goods producing sectors have peaked in terms of growth, services still have upside potential. We remain more wary of inflation than recession. The ending of Covid restrictions (at least for now) in China should also be a positive for the global economy with demand effects outweighing supply side improvements. If so, this will be another reason to expect commodity prices to remain firm, increasing the difficulty of central banks to bring down inflation, especially with household and corporate fundamentals so strong. The outlook for corporate bonds is mixed. The simple metric is: hard landing bad; soft landing good. While we wait to see which one wins out, spreads should remain in recent ranges (+120 – 150 bps on U.S. IG index, somewhat higher on high yield, +350 – 550 bps). Volatility amongst companies and sectors is likely to remain high as companies navigate high inflation and supply/ input challenges (and of course ongoing corporate disruption). Recent spread widening in April/May took spreads into recession-like territory (+150 bps). This proved too wide given continued economic resilience and higher absolute yields. On the other hand, corporate results are unlikely to improve significantly, leaving IG spreads stuck between where they began the year and May wides. We still like credit for their carry, see opportunities in idiosyncratic situations whereby some companies have been unduly punished in the April/May sell off. Emerging Markets (EM) was a tale of two markets in May. Local outperformed with external lagging significantly. Local returns were boosted by strong EM FX performance. Lower rated external EM continues to struggle with high energy and food inflation, undermining fiscal balances and economic growth. With several frontier economies on the verge of or restructuring, risk remains there as well. Countries that benefit from high oil and food prices have performed well. Country level analysis will be vital to uncover value as we expect markets to place an emphasis on differentiation amongst countries and credits. EM is likely to struggle as long as Developed Markets (DM) central banks remain on their current hawkish trajectory and inflation stays high. EM external looks reasonably attractive but lacks a catalyst to spark a rally. Developed Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW Broadly, the move in DM rates was mixed, occurring on a country-by-country basis. Central bank policy and indications from policy members drove much of the monthly moves, with a more dovish Fed bringing down most U.S. rates, while surprisingly hawkish sentiment from the ECB, Bank of England (BoE), and Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) led to selloffs elsewhere. Markets started pricing in more growth/recession concerns, leading risk assets to sell off and causing a more typical negative correlation between risk assets and U.S. Treasuries to appear, with Treasuries attractive as a safe haven asset.1 OUTLOOK Central banks are still forced to navigate a tough situation to achieve a soft landing that will cool inflation without pushing the economy into a recession. While the slight decline in U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) may indicate that the economy has pushed past the peak, the key will be how long, and how high, inflation will remain. Emerging Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW EMD segments were mixed in May with the local index achieving positive returns primarily due to broad currency strength, while average spreads on the hard currency indices—both sovereign and corporate—widened, leading to muted performance. Outflows continued from the asset class as a whole and across both local and hard currency funds.2 OUTLOOK Valuations appear to be compensating investors well at these levels while areas of opportunity remain. Inflationary pressures will likely continue for both developed and emerging markets in the near term as energy and food prices remain elevated. As such, Fed tightening remains a notable concern, but markets appear to be appropriately pricing in that risk. Country-level analysis will be critical in uncovering pockets of opportunity within this diverse universe. Corporate Credit MONTHLY REVIEW For much of the month, continued concern over the impact of inflation, interest rates and tightening liquidity on corporate and consumer health weighed on risk sentiment.3 As such, corporate credit sectors underperformed. Investment grade credit spreads widened slightly in May, with Europe notably underperforming the U.S. The high yield market experienced pronounced weakness for the balance of May before rallying aggressively in the final days of the month. Global convertibles fell again in May as well, underperforming both equities and bonds.4 The senior corporate loan market also sank in May.5 OUTLOOK Looking forward we see spreads rangebound. Markets are supported by more attractive valuations and strong corporate results, yet constrained by continued macro uncertainties, and weak technicals given the lack of demand while market volatility remains high. We are cautious on the high yield market. The high yield market experienced significant pockets of volatility this year and there is little to suggest the environment for high yield will become materially more supportive over the near term. While we have continued conviction in the loan market’s relatively healthy credit picture, the geopolitical situation in Europe clouds the outlook. Securitized Products MONTHLY REVIEW Recession fears caused securitized credit spreads to widen further in May while government-guaranteed agency MBS tightened. Agency MBS bounced back and outperformed both U.S. Treasuries and credit assets in May, however, Agency MBS spreads are still materially wider than pre-pandemic levels as the market is pricing in the end of quantitative easing and likely the beginning of quantitative tightening. U.S. non-agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) spreads widened further across nearly all residential sectors over the month. U.S. ABS spreads were also wider in May, but fundamental credit performance remains strong.6 OUTLOOK We believe the securitized market still offers a unique combination of low durations, attractive yields, and solid credit fundamentals. We remain constructive on securitized credit and believe sector and security selection will become more important in the coming years if the economy softens. We remain cautious on agency MBS and interest rate risk. × The views and opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Management team as of May 2022 and are subject to change based on market, economic and other conditions.

Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. × Global Fixed Income Team Our fixed income investment capabilities are driven by eight specialized teams – Agency MBS, Emerging Markets, Floating-Rate Loans, High Yield, Investment Grade Credit, Municipals, Multi-Sector, and Securitized – which span the global fixed income capital markets.

"I think there is a greater than 50% chance that the S&amp;P 500 intra-day low of May 20th (S&amp;P 500 = 3810) was the market low for the year. There are plenty of reasons why that may not be the case, but I am increasingly of the opinion that, while it’s not necessarily clear sailing from here, that low might hold. Let’s begin with a discussion of the three supporting reasons for my conclusion before moving to the arguments against. Technical On May 20th, the market dropped to, and ultimately rejected, a 20% correction. A substantial close below that level would have moved the market into a true bear market. The market stopped dropping at the important 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the 2020-2022 rally. The following week, the NYSE had 3 days in a row where over 80% of the total volume was on the upside. That’s a very bullish sign. The last three times the market had that kind of positive breadth (2011, 2016 and 2020), every time stopped a decline and led to dramatic upside in stocks over the following three and six months. On June 2nd, Fed Vice Chair Brainard sounded surprisingly hawkish, and the largest software company in the world lowered guidance. While seemingly two big negatives, the market rallied despite the news. As Leon Cooperman says, a good time to buy stocks is when they stop going down on bad news. Macro Could 2022 be a repeat of 1998, 2011 and 2018? In each of those years, the market declined and stopped just short of -20%, followed by a dramatic recovery leading to new all-time highs within 6 months. In each of those years, the macro issues causing the selloff were very different, as they are in 2022. However, the commonality was in each of those years there was no recession. In effect, the market rejected the macro issues that had caused the anxious selloff. So, will we have a recession this year? That question leads to my final reason of why May 20th could have been the low for the year: Fundamental Clearly, corporate America does not see the same level of weakness that the stock market is projecting. Insider buying is off the charts—1 standard deviation above trend. Except for the energy area, insider selling has dried up. Corporate buybacks are accelerating. The original estimate of $750 billion in buybacks for the year has already reached $600 billion just for the first half of 2022.1 Anecdotally, I hear corporate buyback desks are quite busy. Not to mention, earnings guidance has moved HIGHER. Yes, that’s right, higher, NOT lower. The bottom-up S&amp;P 500 consensus earnings (which is what companies use to guide the sell side) has moved higher every week, not lower. Clearly the economy is slowing. I do not expect revisions to continue higher forever, but my base case all year has been that the economy will prove far more resilient than what the bears predict. So far, this has certainly proven to be the case. All in all, the arguments are compelling for May 20th being the equity market low for the year, so why wouldn’t I indicate more confidence than a “greater than 50% chance”? Because there are plenty of issues to cause worry: Quantitative tightening (QT): We have never experienced a similar magnitude of QT before. Therefore, there is no way to know the ramifications of the Fed not buying as much as $30 – $60+ billion of Treasuries and as much as $35 billion of mortgage-backed securities per month. Jamie Dimon’s statement: “A hurricane is coming.” What does that mean? What does he see? Don’t Fight the Fed. They still have plenty of tightening to go. Sky-high gasoline prices. How much will this dent other consumption?. While some inflationary inputs seem to be peaking, the actual inflation rate is still running at a level that historically does not provide good equity returns. Therefore, the recession call becomes key. But if there is no recession, stocks could be substantially higher by the time that is apparent. I am not in the ‘recession is coming’ camp. I agree with corporate America, but clearly, we cannot rule out the possibility. So what’s an investor to do? The S&amp;P 500 has had a relatively rapid bounce off that 3810 low. I would not be surprised to see some short-term weakness.. But I maintain the 6-12 month returns off these levels will be very attractive, and therefore expecting further substantial weakness may be either too greedy or overly pessimistic. Finally, two quick points on AEA’s portfolio positioning. We have had a value over growth bias in our U.S. exposure. That is moderating. We believe the magnitude of underperformance of quality growth stocks (particularly in the consumer sector) leads us to increase our growth allocation. Clearly there are negative headlines, but the real money is never made when “the coast is clear”. Our stock selection bias is to favor companies that have generated high levels of profitability relative to their peers and have produced outsized shareholder returns over time, adding them to the portfolios when they are out of favor and depressed. Increasingly, quality growth stocks are meeting these criteria. Our Global strategies have steadfastly maintained a significant allocation to Asia ex-Japan, while remaining underweight in Europe and Japan. While the Asia ex-Japan overweight hurt performance in 2021 and into 2022, the tide is beginning to turn as China reopens from the COVID lockdown, growth-supportive initiatives continue, and regulatory risks appear to be receding. As the clouds begin to clear, these stocks are attracting more investor interest. 1 JPMorgan.

"We have engaged directly with companies on issues material to the sustainability of returns for over 20 years. As active managers running concentrated portfolios and with a long-term investment horizon, we believe we are well positioned to engage with management on material ESG topics and influence companies towards better practices. × We seek to deliver better outcomes for our clients through producing attractive returns over the long term. To do this, we must invest with a conscious eye on whether companies can deliver better outcomes not just today, but 5, 10, and even 20 years from now. We back companies that have the characteristics needed to lead in the long run, like recurring revenue, pricing power and strong management, and importantly also invest to manage and improve their ESG impact. Direct, portfolio manager-led engagement is, in our view, vital to understanding whether companies and management can deliver in these areas. We prioritise our engagement and voting efforts based on what we believe are the most material long-term issues facing our companies.

Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy’s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. × Marte Borhaug Head of Sustainable Outcomes International Equity Team Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Previous Next",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/engage-spring-2022.html
"The US led the rebound in risk assets during the last week of May. However, most markets ended the month flat. The S&amp;P 500 returned 0.2% (USD), the MSCI Europe was down 0.6% (EUR) and MSCI Japan paused its downward trajectory of previous months, ending May up 0.9% (JPY)1 . The MSCI Emerging Markets Index returned 0.5%1. Energy continued to be the clear sector outperformer with the MSCI ACWI Energy index up 12.2%, on the back of slowly rising oil prices1. The US 10-Year Treasury yield appears to have finally settled, ending the month a fraction lower than in April, at 2.8% . The VIX moved down to end the month at 262. × The fall in the S&amp;P 500 at the beginning of the month appeared mostly driven by multiple compression. Despite a bounce in the final week, we still believe though this is likely a bear market rally, due to increasing signs of deteriorating consumer confidence and slowing growth. We finally saw the correlation between equities and fixed income turn negative. Should equities fall, investors at least now may have somewhere to hide. Now that the correlation appears to have been restored, we are increasingly comfortable with fixed income and believe the decline in yields should stabilise. With tentative signs that inflation is plateauing, as we progress through the late stages of the cycle, we believe US investment grade credit should outperform high yield credit and equities, especially if recession risks rise. That said, we do not anticipate a US recession until 2H 2023. Investment Implications We have been keeping our powder dry, so we can move cash back into markets at opportune moments. We are already seeing opportunities in the fixed income space. In May we maintained our allocation to equities, but deployed cash to increase duration risk by allocating broadly to fixed income. Before the last week of the month, we increased equity exposure via futures, as options deltas had dropped. This is consistent with the team’s view that the market may be oversold in the near term. The subsequent rally in equities in the last week of May indicated our view was correct. We have made the following tactical changes over May. The implementation of these is dependent on portfolio guidelines and some portfolios may not permit: High Dividend, Low Volatility Equities We added an overweight to high dividend, low volatility equities, through an ETF. This offers an attractive dividend yield from US equities, plus exposure to defensive and value sectors, which continue to trade at a discount to growth. The relatively low volatility and beta characteristics should mitigate the downside, in the event of further volatility. US Equities Enhanced Value We removed our position in an ETF and moved to Russell 1000 Value futures to take exposure to the value sector more broadly and make room for more focused allocations to other ETFs or mutual funds, for portfolios which have an allocation restriction. Brazilian equities We moved from overweight to neutral Brazilian equities. We had moved overweight in April, but the investment case is weakening. Terms of trade have likely peaked in the short term, while prospects for two key exports have deteriorated; soybean prices could come under pressure from higher global supply in 2022/23, while China’s continued zero-Covid policy is likely to hit iron ore demand. Commodities We have increased total exposure to commodities, for portfolios which permit, while changing their composition. Within this we have reduced gold, and added a position in an agriculture fund ETF, to gain exposure to agricultural commodity futures. We aim to hedge upside risks to agricultural commodity prices, due to supply disruptions from the conflict in the Ukraine, which is leading to growing food protectionism and rising input costs such as fertiliser, all of which pushes food prices higher. Emerging Market Local Debt We moved from overweight to neutral emerging market short-duration commodity-exporter high-yielder countries, implemented through a bond securities basket. Both the key drivers, real yield and terms of trade have deteriorated since we put on the position. US 10-year Treasuries We have removed the US 10-year Treasuries underweight. Inflation risks are more balanced, given tentative signs of stabilising wage growth, especially as the global growth outlook dims. Expectations of 50bps Fed hikes in the near term, with several 25bps hikes thereafter, are priced in, leaving little room for a hawkish surprise. Investment Grade Corporates We removed our US Investment Grade Corporates underweight and moved to neutral. After recent rates and spreads adjustments, risk-reward in future forward is more balanced as monetary tightening is largely priced in and we see tentative signs of sequential inflation plateauing. Even if recession risks are rising, our analysis suggests higher spreads can be offset by lower rates, leaving an attractive yield. At the same time, we maintained our underweight in European Investment Grade Corporates, as high duration of Investment Grade and compressed spreads are likely to result in poor total returns when yields/spreads rise.

Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser’s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio’s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks.

Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio’s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. × Andrew Harmstone Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Manfred Hui Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Select Product(s) Right Click Edit",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/navigating-changing-correlations.html

"As the world gears up to tackle global warming, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydro power are at the forefront of solutions offered to avert a climate catastrophe. Yet a case needs to be made to include nuclear power in the mix of tools to fight climate change. Given the challenges in quickly expanding renewable energy sources like solar, and increased geopolitical concerns around energy independence, policy makers are finally waking up to the promise of nuclear power. × French president Emmanuel Macron recently announced a €1 billion package of funding in support of small nuclear reactors and pledged to construct 14 new generation reactors.1,2 Newly elected South Korean President Yoon Sukyeol is aiming for nuclear to account for 30% of total power generation, a reversal in policy from the previous president.3 Japan, home to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, recently restarted nuclear capacity.4 China intends to build more nuclear reactors over the next 15 years—150 in total—more than the rest of the world combined has built over the last 35 years.5 Yet, a rebranding of this “elemental” power is needed to overcome legacy perceptions. Nuclear is carbon free, more reliable than other renewables, and possesses a strong safety track record, on par with solar and wind energy. Nuclear energy produces zero direct carbon or GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions. In fact, nuclear has lower GHG emissions than solar and wind when including indirect emissions over its lifecycle. Over the past 50 years, nuclear power has reduced CO2 emissions by more than 60 gigatons, which is almost two years’ worth of global emissions.6 Nuclear has a proven track record for historic decarbonization: three of the five fastest declines in the carbon intensity of energy occurred in countries that embraced nuclear power (Display 1). × Display 1 Nuclear Can Drastically Alter a Carbon FootprintFive fastest declines in energy intensity of carbon  Source: The Breakthrough Institute, December 17, 2018. × Display 1 Nuclear Can Drastically Alter a Carbon FootprintFive fastest declines in energy intensity of carbon Source: The Breakthrough Institute, December 17, 2018. The global energy system requires redundancy and reliability that is hard to achieve with renewables alone. Solar, wind and hydro depend on weather conditions and seasonal cycles that limit consistent use. While battery technology is improving, wind and solar are not reliable “baseload” energy sources. Nuclear power is currently the only carbon-free energy source that can reliably deliver electricity, day or night, 24/7, to critical service providers like hospitals or data centers, more so than any other energy sources including solar, wind and natural gas.7 Arguably the biggest misconception about nuclear power is safety. High-profile accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima have amplified long-standing fears around nuclear. Yet deaths resulting from nuclear energy are 99% lower than deaths from coal and 97% lower than deaths from gas.8 Radiation exposure from Chernobyl, the worst nuclear accident in history, caused an estimated 4,000 premature deaths, according to the United Nations.9 While this is an unthinkable tragedy, researchers have estimated that as many as 4.5 million people died in a single year (2019) from exposure to air pollution caused by fossil fuels.10 What then explains the general public’s fear of nuclear power? To start, nuclear accidents seem to have been seared into the public consciousness. In nearly every case that a country has shut down nuclear power plants, “dirty” power has replaced carbon-free electricity.11 Nuclear waste is a serious concern, but 90% of nuclear waste is “low-level” and only 1% radioactive.12 Three percent of the waste is considered “high-level,” but contrary to popular belief, it is dense and relatively small: by some estimates, the nuclear fuel waste generated in the United States over the past 60 years would “fit on a football field, stacked 20 feet high.”13 Many experts argue that the high cost of nuclear power plants is a function of decades of bureaucracy and bad policies. It’s hard to imagine but since 1975, with regulatory red tape slowing the licensing process, no new nuclear plant has ever reached operation.14 Furthermore, renewables other than nuclear receive far more generous subsidies and tax breaks. For example, in 2018, nuclear received a mere $13 million in federal tax incentives per unit of energy produced, while wind received over $2 billion and solar over $3.3 billion.15 Emerging market countries, including China, South Korea and India, have demonstrated a willingness to embrace nuclear energy (Display 2). × Display 2 Emerging Markets Leads New Nuclear Capacity AdditionsTotal under construction reactor net capacity (in thousands MWe)  Source: “World Nuclear Performance Report 2021” × Display 2 Emerging Markets Leads New Nuclear Capacity AdditionsTotal under construction reactor net capacity (in thousands MWe) Source: “World Nuclear Performance Report 2021” China is the world’s new champion for nuclear energy. President Xi Jinping considers nuclear as a key part of the “Made in China 2025” strategy, designed to bolster high-tech industries. China also announced the construction of the world’s first commercial small modular reactor in South China’s Hainan Province. After completion, the reactor will have an annual power generation capacity of 1 billion-kilowatt-hours, meeting the energy demands of 526,000 homes.16 Given the challenges of achieving “net zero” through our current global energy mix, we expect nuclear to become a more favored alternative and play a key role in a coordinated global energy transition. We also believe nuclear power can play a role in helping developing countries achieve energy security without the need to rely on fossil fuels. Several hurdles remain including safety, cost and public support. But just as COVID led to seismic changes in how we work, climate concerns and geopolitical events will revive support for nuclear power: a safe, reliable and carbon-free source of energy. × DOWNLOAD TALES FROM THE EMERGING WORLD .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:fit-content; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Stocks of small-capitalization companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets, and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more-established companies. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the Portfolio’s performance. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Cryptocurrency (notably, Bitcoin) operates as a decentralized, peer-to-peer financial exchange and value storage that is used like money. It is not backed by any government. Federal, state or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency may experience very high volatility. 1 The New York Times - February 10, 2022 - Alderman, L. - France announces major nuclear power buildup 2 Reuters – November 9, 2021 - Kar-Gupta, Sudip - Macron says France will build new nuclear energy reactors 3 Bloomberg.com - March 9, 2022 - Lee, H. - South Korea’s Pro-Nuclear President-Elect Boosts Atomic Stocks 4 Reuters - October 5, 2021 - Obayashi, Y. - Japan Eyes Renewables, nuclear restart in race for 2030 climate goal 5 Bloomberg.com. - November 2, 2021 - Murtaugh, D. - China’s Climate Goals Hinge on a $440 Billion Nuclear Buildout 6 International Energy Agency - 2019 - Nuclear Power in a Clean Energy System 7 Energy.gov - March 24, 2021 - Mueller, M. - Nuclear power is the most reliable energy source and it’s not even close 8 Our World in Data - November 28, 2020 - Ritchie, H. &amp; Roser, M. - Nuclear energy 9 World Health Organization - September 5, 2005 - Chernobyl: The True Scale of the accident 10 Our World in Data - November 12, 2019 - Ritchie, H., &amp; Roser, M. - Outdoor Air Pollution 11 Foreign Policy - October 8, 2021 - Nordhaus, T. - In global energy crisis, anti-nuclear chickens come home to roost 12 World Nuclear Association – January 2022 - Radioactive Waste Management | Nuclear Waste Disposal 13 The Wall Street Journal - January 11, 2019 - Goldstein, J.

"The private equity secondary market is fairly well known, and one could argue it has become heavily trafficked in recent years. Other secondary markets—such as those for hedge funds and private credit—may be less familiar to investors. While these markets are smaller, transactions can offer compelling returns. With the majority of return coming from realization of discount to net asset value (NAV), these investments can offer important risk mitigation benefits as well. This may be of particular interest today, against a backdrop of quantitative tightening and declining liquidity. × Private equity fund investors seeking to sell interests on the secondary market have been met with robust demand. According to Preqin, the private equity secondary market has grown over five times in the last decade. Today, private equity secondary buyers collectively manage $300 billion with $127 billion of dry powder.1 (Display 1) This has resulted in high transaction volumes at limited discounts to net asset value for traditional private equity secondaries. × Display 1: Private Equity Secondaries Assets Under Management ($bn)  Source: Preqin Secondary Market Update: H1 2021 × Display 1: Private Equity Secondaries Assets Under Management ($bn) Source: Preqin Secondary Market Update: H1 2021 In contrast, alternative fund investors seeking to sell illiquid assets not comprised of private equity have not been met with this same level of demand. In fact, private equity secondaries comprised more than 90% of all alternative fund secondaries in 2021,2 leaving less than 10% in hedge funds, infrastructure, real estate, real asset and private credit funds combined. (Display 2) × Display 2: Secondary Volume Across Alternative Asset Classes  Source: “Volume Report FY 2021”. Setter Capital. January 2022. × Display 2: Secondary Volume Across Alternative Asset Classes Source: “Volume Report FY 2021”. Setter Capital. January 2022. Whereas the private equity secondary market is characterized by large intermediaries, transparent processes, cooperative general partners, standardized settlement mechanics and many well- capitalized buyers, the opposite conditions exist for other types of alternative fund secondary markets. We believe this vastly different demand dynamic presents a rich opportunity set for buyers who are able to pursue “undiscovered” secondary markets. Buyers may benefit from less efficient pricing and higher discounts to NAV. Compared to private equity secondaries, these higher discounts provide greater downside protection and make the strategy less reliant on growth in asset values and leverage to achieve returns. Below we delve into reasons why the demand dynamic differs—why we think that will persist—and why the dry powder within the private equity secondary market has not reached other alternative asset categories, notably hedge funds and private credit. Transaction Size The average size of private equity secondary funds raised in 1H 2020 was $4 billion.3 To efficiently deploy that capital, focusing due diligence on material position sizes and avoiding excessive line items, these private equity buyers tend to target average transaction sizes greater than $100 million. While the total hedge fund market is $4 trillion,4 the majority of that capital is redeemable at NAV and unlikely to require a secondary sale. When secondary needs do arise in illiquid hedge funds, the transaction size infrequently exceeds $50 million. Similarly, while private credit assets under management have grown substantially over the last decade, at $1.2 trillion5 the industry remains a fraction of the size of the $6.8 trillion6 private equity market. (Display 3) As is the case for hedge funds, this leads to lower transaction volumes and smaller transaction sizes for private credit secondaries. Because of their need to traffic in fairly large size, private equity secondary players find themselves confined to the one market that can supply large transactions today, traditional private equity. And they continue to aim their dry powder accordingly. × Display 3: Private Debt Assets under Management and Forecast, 2010 – 2026*  Source: 2022 Preqin Global Private Debt Report.

January 2022. *2021 figure is annualized based on data to March. 2022-2026 are Preqin’s forecasted figures. Asset Class By mandate and experience, private equity secondary players focus on funds that contain control private equity positions. Secondaries that arise in other types of alternative funds may include private equity, but typically span several asset classes including credit, litigation, real estate and real assets. Furthermore, the fund manager (or sponsor) may or may not have a control position. Private equity secondary buyers are not apt to traffic outside of their core asset class mandate, leaving these other alternative categories without a natural incumbent buyer. Structure Private equity fund structures are fairly homogeneous. They are generally closed- ended with an investment period, a harvest period and extension options; they usually charge a management fee and carried interest over a preferred return. Investors typically own a pro-rata portion of all investments in the fund. When secondary opportunities arise in hedge funds, the structures are quite disparate. For instance, illiquidity could be the result of an initial lock-up, a side pocket, a suspension in redemptions or myriad other reasons. Depending on the structure, hedge fund secondary investors could own a pro-rata portion of the fund or they could own underlying assets in differing portions. Fee structures are frequently modified and may differ between liquid and illiquid assets. These variables require nuanced due diligence, presenting a barrier to entry for potential buyers unaccustomed to such complexities. Relationships and Alignment of Interests While there are a small number of asset managers that span alternatives, for the most part the universes of private equity managers and hedge fund managers are distinct. Private equity secondary players tend to have relationships with private equity managers, but little familiarity with hedge fund managers. Hedge fund managers have no particular incentive to cultivate relationships with private equity secondary buyers. While private equity managers have the incentive to find buyers able to meet unfunded commitments, hedge fund investments are fully funded. Therefore, hedge funds are generally not as proactive in helping would-be sellers find buyers—particularly buyers that are not likely to support growth in the liquid side of their businesses. Process and Transparency A traditional private equity secondary transaction entails multiple rounds of bids organized by an intermediary with a well-populated data room and access to the sponsor. Once the winning bidder is determined, the closing mechanics are fairly uniform. Financing is typically available to the buyer, if desired. Buyers and sellers of illiquid funds in other alternative categories are not typically able to engage in the same process. Because of a combination of lack of size, motivation and secondary experience, information is not as readily accessible. Buyers with historical knowledge of the assets and an existing relationship with the asset manager are better-positioned to overcome this barrier to entry. Discounts Are Worth the Effort We believe that secondary investors should expand their focus beyond the well-trodden private equity secondary market. While traversing in undiscoveredsecondary markets has challenges, it can be rewarding. For buyers who are able to navigate this more opaque terrain and are willing to deploy less capital per opportunity, the discounts to NAV can be much greater. In a period of declining equity and fixed income valuations, the higher discount to NAV can provide portfolios much-needed downside protection, shifting the driver of return toward liquidity provision versus growth in asset prices. × 1 Preqin Secondary Market Update: H1 2021 2 “Volume Report FY 2021”.

"If March was a tough month, April was literally off the charts! Returns across the asset spectrum were dire, except of course if your asset included ‘commodity’ in its name. Rising yields and widening spreads were the name of the game. April was also the month when equities caught up to fixed income and now have worse returns year-to-date (S&amp;P 500 down 13.3%). While a bunch of problems in the world can be blamed on the Russian/Ukrainian situation, it is not the primary driver anymore. The reason for the carnage: inflation, inflation, inflation! And of course, what central banks are doing and planning to do about it. × Inflation shows no sign of significantly abating. U.S. inflation may have peaked, but that is a hollow victory when headline inflation is 8.5% (highest since 1982). Central banks, particularly the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), are now on a warpath to get rates up quickly or “expeditiously” using Chairman Powell’s parlance. Markets have priced in rapid rate hikes generally everywhere, but most importantly in the U.S. where the economy appears to be overheating the most outside of Eastern Europe. With labor markets still firm if not too firm central banks will be in no mood to lift the slow pace of tightening until policy gets to at least neutral. Interestingly, for the first time in a while the U.S. yield curve steepened, with U.S. Treasury 2-year yields up only 38 basis points (bps) while U.S. Treasury 10-year yields rose 60 bps, suggesting the Fed is not doing enough to contain inflation risks, despite the fact that expectations of year-end 3-month rates rose 45 bps. The combination of the rise in yields, heightened worries of tighter policy AND a horrible performance of equities undermined credit and emerging markets. While the U.S. Treasury market returned -3.1% in April, investment-grade corporates returned -5%, high yield -3.6% and emerging markets -5.9%. The sharp fall in equities, bodes ill for high yield, the most equity sensitive part of fixed income. The risk-off environment in April also boosted the U.S. dollar. It rose anywhere from 2% against the Singapore dollar to 6.5% versus the Japanese yen to over 7% against the South African rand, a negative development for the global economy. × DISPLAY 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date  Note: USD-based performance.

Fixed Income Outlook Developments in April did not deviate materially from the trajectory established earlier this year. Inflation continues to be a source of concern which, combined with tight labor markets, will—in our view—keep central banks on their tightening trajectory. Commodities, particularly food prices are likely to firm further, exacerbating the central bank’s inflation problem. The Fed does not plan to letup in tightening until at least policy is back to neutral, a level Chairman Powell has identified as a broad 2-3% range, giving them significantly leeway to up the pace this year if inflation does not improve. Another 150 bps of hikes this year looks taking U.S. Fed funds to the middle of the neutral range. Global yields remain biased to rise further. As time passes, it becomes clearer and clearer that monetary policy was kept too easy for too long. We are talking about ALL central banks save the ones in China and Japan. Monetary policy everywhere, not just in the U.S., is in a race to catch up to “neutral” or move to a restrictive stance. But the gap between inflation and interest rates remains wide in most countries, indicating that unless inflation falls materially or is expected to fall materially in the months ahead, more rate hikes are coming. If inflation does not fall enough (yet to be defined, but probably no higher than the Fed’s current end of year forecast), expect additional unexpected tightening next year, i.e., a higher terminal Fed funds rate. This would raise the probability of a recession in 2023 and undermine credit assets. The primary reason for unremitting central bank hawkishness is growth remains firm despite all the challenges thrown at it this year. Although inflation is acting as a tax on households and businesses and yields are moving higher, labor markets and corporate profitability are strongly supporting spending. For example, financial balances among households and corporations (big and small) are strong in surplus. It is estimated that the household sector has a surplus of 0.8% of GDP larger than pre-pandemic AND has accumulated approximately $3 trillion of excess savings. Moreover, corporate excess savings across the entire corporate universe are also high, equating to about 3% of GDP. What this means is that the probability of achieving a soft landing, a reduction of inflation to target AND no recession is much higher. On the negative side, an economy with strong private sector balance sheets AND income generating capabilities will be harder to slow down, meaning the Fed may have to raise rates by more than is expected to get the requisite slowdown in demand to bring inflation to target. Thus, given the current level and trajectory of yields, we do not anticipate a recession either this year or next. The earliest it could happen based on our analysis is 2024. This is a long way off and supports a more 1994 interpretation of this year’s rate hiking cycle as one that will slow things down enough to contain inflation without throwing the U.S. or global economy into a recession. We must keep in mind that the global economy is decelerating from a very high level with little risk of near-term economic downturn. Corporate profitability is likely to be varied. The energy, commodities, and defense sectors are likely to benefit; Healthcare and Telecoms will be least affected, and for Utilities it will depend on their exact regulatory and commodity exposure. Both industrial and consumer sectors will be negatively affected, but at least they were experiencing strong demand going into the crisis. However, there is no denying that the impact will be negative, with European corporates more affected. Spreads are now materially wider than at the beginning of the year, with notable underperformance of Europe. Credit fundamentals are mixed. Credit quality is mixed in terms of profitability, earnings growth has likely peaked, and leverage and margins are plateauing. But balance sheets, liquidity and debt servicing capacity remain exceptionally strong, in our opinion. And, importantly spread widening as nominal and yields rise and economic data slows. It will be important to differentiate those companies who can continue to thrive in such an environment. Active management is likely to be key to performance. We do maintain a preference at the margin for high yield over investment grade but that is very idiosyncratic and industry specific and of late have been reducing credit risk in general. EM outperformance has ended as global yields surged. Inflation problems tied to food and other commodities make many EM central banks biased to continue to raise rates as fast or faster than in developed countries. With several frontier economies on the verge of restructuring, risk remains there as well. Country level analysis will be vital to uncover value as we expect markets to place an emphasis on differentiation amongst countries and credits. EM is likely to struggle as long as DM central banks remain on their current hawkish trajectory and China struggles. A signal that things are turning will be a softening in the U.S. dollar. Although it has risen substantially in April and is likely to consolidate, there is no sign yet that its strength is coming to an end. Developed Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW In April, yields continued their upward trend as markets priced in even more hawkish central bank policy. While economic data was more mixed, it continued to remain strong overall and on average was better than economists expected, allowing central banks to emphasize curbing inflation rather than having to support growth. Risk assets in general performed poorly as investors worried about the impact of tighter monetary policy and rising costs.1 OUTLOOK Central banks have a challenging task in front of them: to curb inflation without hurting growth too much. Inflationary pressures remain very strong, but downside growth risks have also increased. The war in Ukraine continues, causing higher energy and commodity prices, which are already reducing consumer confidence and discretionary spending power. COVID remains impactful, with outbreaks in China sustaining supply chain disruptions. While a lot of hikes have already been priced in, neutral policy rate expectations are still modest vs. history, suggesting yields could rise further. Regarding foreign exchange, the U.S. dollar is likely to remain a beneficiary of tighter Fed policy and growing global growth concerns, while the yen may weaken further due to Japanese monetary policy being more accommodative than everywhere else. Emerging Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW Emerging Markets Debt (EMD) continued to be challenged along with the broader risk markets in April. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine persisted with their focus concentrated on the eastern region. The annual spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) occurred in Washington D.C. and in person for the first time since 2019. The overall tone was somewhat pessimistic as global growth was revised down for 2022 and 2023 and inflation projections increased.2 The three major EMD indices (U.S. dollar-denominated corporate debt,3 local sovereign debt,4 and U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign debt)5 were negative for the month. OUTLOOK We are optimistic on EMD as valuations appear to be well-compensating investors for the risk. The Russia/Ukraine war will continue to drive headlines and may continue for quite some time. Fundamentals are mixed, and while Fed tightening is a concern, markets appear to be pricing that in somewhat aggressively. The growth and inflation dynamic remains critical. Country level analysis will be vital to uncover value as we expect markets to place an emphasis on differentiation amongst countries and credits. Corporate Credit MONTHLY REVIEW Credit spreads widened in April with general market volatility elevated once again amidst heightened macro uncertainty. News in the month continued to be dominated by the conflict between Russia/Ukraine where no progress was made towards a resolution. Credit markets saw weak technicals with demand limited by the negative price action in fixed income as risk free yields rose. Supply in April was significantly down.6 The high yield market was particularly weak in April. Over the month, the average yield climbed and the average spread grew significantly amidst a sharp jump in Treasury yields and weak technical conditions. Growing concern over the eventual economic impact from aggressive tightening of monetary conditions and the potential for an eventual “hard landing” prompted investors to reassess exposure to the lowest-rated segments of the high yield market. The top performing sectors for the month were transportation, other industrial and basic industry.7 Global convertibles fell the most in two years as concerns over inflation, interest rates and corporate earnings rattled markets. Convertibles, however, did outperform both of its underlying components. The convertibles market is now priced far closer to bonds than stocks as a lot of paper trades below par with less equity delta and more yield to maturity.8 OUTLOOK We see spreads likely to be rangebound. Markets are supported by more attractive valuations and strong corporate results yet constrained by the macro uncertainties and weak technicals given the lack of demand while market volatility remains high. We are cautious on the high yield market, which has experienced significant pockets of volatility this year and there is little to suggest the environment for high yield will be become materially more supportive over the near term. Securitized Products MONTHLY REVIEW April was another challenging month for securitized markets. Agency MBS underperformed again in April. Current coupon agency MBS spreads widened as the market is pricing in the end of quantitative easing (QE) and likely the beginning of quantitative tightening (QT). Agency MBS spreads could widen further as the Fed continues to reduce its purchases and possibly sell MBS. U.S. Non-agency RMBS spreads were significantly wider across all residential sectors in April, as nearly all risk assets cheapened given concerns about inflation, central bank policies and geo-political events. U.S. ABS spreads were also wider in April, but fundamental credit performance remains strong.9 OUTLOOK We believe the securitized market still offers a unique combination of low durations, attractive yields, and solid credit fundamentals. We remain constructive on securitized credit. We remain cautious on agency MBS and interest rate risk. × The views and opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Management team as of May 2022 and are subject to change based on market, economic and other conditions.

There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. × Global Fixed Income Team Our fixed income investment capabilities are driven by eight specialized teams – Agency MBS, Emerging Markets, Floating-Rate Loans, High Yield, Investment Grade Credit, Municipals, Multi-Sector, and Securitized – which span the global fixed income capital markets.

"AT A GLANCE • Big Tech has grown incredibly large, fueled by the unprecedented collection, processing and analysis of digital data. • Yet this growth has conflicted with users’ interests, particularly in areas related to user privacy, and misinformation. This may raise questions about the sustainability of Big Tech’s growth models. • At the same time, these companies’ concentrated market power also raises questions about potential antitrust action. • Corporate governance structures appear inadequate for guiding more effective self-regulation, which raises regulatory risks at a time when technology is being buffeted by macro headwinds. • In our view, shining a sustainability light on the dark side of Big Tech can yield important insights into risks that traditional (non-ESG) approaches may under-appreciate. × Introduction In today’s digital economy, data is the key resource underpinning economic value creation. Data is crucial to the development of most online services and is indispensable to the development of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Capturing and analysing data is therefore central to the business models of some of the most successful companies in today’s economy. However, as with the overuse of natural resources, the pervasive collection of data, particularly personal data, has negative externalities that cannot be ignored. In this paper, we focus on the “Big Tech” companies that dominate the new data economy. We discuss the potential social consequences associated with digital data mining and assess whether these issues might become a headwind for these data-driven companies, which are increasingly in the shadow of the regulator. By “Big Tech,” we are primarily referring to mega-cap technology companies headquartered in the U.S.1 While not homogeneous, we find it analytically useful to bundle these companies together, given their societal omnipresence and market power. The Rise and Rise of Big Tech Notwithstanding recent market volatility, Big Tech firms have grown to be among the largest public companies in the world. As a result, U.S. large-cap capitalization-weighted indices such as the S&amp;P 500 are now much less diversified. In fact, just five companies in our ‘Big Tech’ category make up almost 23% of the S&amp;P 500, with the two largest constituents’ combined weight (13.0%) now larger than that of the Real Estate, Energy, Materials and Utilities and sectors combined (11.5%). Big Tech is the Internet Big Tech firms typically provide access to digital platforms, which connect buyers and sellers or individual users. Often, these platforms’ strong network effects benefit from economies of scale, which reinforce a potential “winner takes all” dynamic. Put simply, the more a product is used, the more useful it becomes. Consider the example of online social networks, which are more useful for individuals if everyone they know is on the same platforms. Data facilitates these network effects, with the firm’s product usefulness enhanced by either using revenues derived from user data or by exploiting insights derived from the collected user interaction data. This, in turn, attracts more users and drives more revenue. These same network effects and economies of scale may explain concentration in some segments of the digital economy. × DISPLAY 1: Market Cap of the Five Big Tech Companies as % of S&amp;P 500 Index  Source: Bloomberg; Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

We believe that investors who fully appreciate these social risks may benefit, particularly as these conflicts materialise and attract the attention of regulators in key markets. For example, the more personal data a platform harvests and stores, the more the platform’s operator will be exposed to risks around privacy concerns. Additionally, the addictive nature of many platforms also raises the potential for societal problems such as damage to users’ mental health, misinformation and even extremism. These issues may pose a risk to companies’ value creation by limiting their growth prospects, either through the migration of users or advertisers or, increasingly, through regulatory and competition initiatives. Social Responsibility The Algorithm Decides For Big Tech companies that rely on data harvesting, engagement is key to growth. Big Tech platforms can capture more valuable data by keeping user attention fixed for longer. The drive to maximize data collection and therefore value has resulted in systems optimized to capture and retain users’ attention, with little regard for consequences. Content is a case in point. Material that elicits a strong emotional reaction has proven highly effective in capturing user attention and prolonging engagement. It is little wonder that the pursuit to optimize engagement can lead to algorithms designed to amplify and promote sensational and divisive content.2 Consider, too, that algorithms curate content based on a user’s unique interests. Such personalization limits exposure to outside views in a process that can create view-distorting “filter bubbles.” Roger McNamee, the renowned early Big Tech investor turned activist, claims that filtering results in social polarization, rising mental health issues, hate speech and even violence.3 On the one hand, this combination can prove fertile ground for the spread of disinformation. For example, disinformation related to Covid-19 and vaccines has proliferated across social media, resulting in vaccine hesitancy among some populations.4 In 2019, this led the World Health Organization to add vaccine hesitancy to the list of the top 10 threats to global health.5 On the other hand, global society is not oblivious to the dangers of indiscriminate algorithmic preferencing. A recent worldwide poll conducted by Lloyds Register Foundation and Gallup, of 150,000 people in 142 countries, found that internet users view “fake news” as their major concern.6 Ultimately, this suggests that users may push back. Platforms that fail to address the scourge of “fake news” may see users, and their valuable data, migrate elsewhere. × DISPLAY 3: “Fake News” a Key Worry for Global Internet Users  Source: Lloyd’s Register Foundation.

(2020) The Lloyd’s Register Foundation World Risk Poll. Self-Regulation – A Solution? While algorithms may lack the value systems of humans, they reflect the biases of their creators. The proliferation of algorithms in sorting and selecting content places a responsibility on the creators to ensure they are trained on a sufficiently diverse data set. Failure to self-regulate could impose burdens on companies such as increased transparency or limiting of use of algorithmic prioritizing, such as those proposed by U.S. House Lawmakers in the Filter Bubble Transparency Act. To date, tech companies have been slow to address this problem, save in extreme cases. This is due in part to a piece of U.S. legislation enacted in the 90s, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which grants wide immunity against liability for harmful content posted on platforms. However, support has emerged to amend Section 230 and the changes could have profound effects. Each internet platform company operating in the U.S. has explicitly identified Section 230 amendments as a business risk. Even if exposed companies manage to avoid costly sanctions through self-regulation, they would likely be forced to invest significantly into content-management initiatives, particularly as their presence grows in emerging markets, which have varying cultural and linguistic requirements. As operating expenses in technology can be high, even before these added outlays, additional expenses to monitor content may surprise to the downside. Additionally, if users feel like their free speech rights are being infringed upon by overzealous moderation, they may seek alternative, more laissez-faire platforms. This highlights the delicate balancing act today’s virtual public squares must strike between free speech and content moderation. Privacy Paradox As more activities move online, data privacy and protection have become paramount. Data privacy is centered around how data is collected, processed, stored and shared with third parties. Handling troves of digital personal data leaves Big Tech companies highly exposed to concerns around privacy. However, do users care about privacy? The evidence is mixed. Users voluntarily sign lengthy and complex legal terms and services (T&amp;Cs) documents detailing the use of their personal data by the platform and their partners for commercial purposes. A study of 2,000 consumers in the U.S. found that 91% consent to legal T&amp;Cs without reading them,7 a phenomenon known as ‘click wrap’. Thus, it is likely users do not fully comprehend the volume of data that is gathered on them. In fact, studies show that users do care about the scale and intensity of data harvesting when this is disclosed to them. 8 Given the frequent controversies around data use, we believe users may become more discerning. While they are typically happy to share data in exchange for a useful, free, or personalized product, they may be more likely to withhold permission when it is for services they do not highly value, such as targeted advertising. A 2021 UBS survey of circa 2,000 Americans found that 42% of respondents have already updated their privacy settings on a social media site to be more restrictive and 22% plan to. Notably, the rate of teenage users planning to update their privacy settings has risen consistently, indicating that younger cohorts may find the privacy/personalization trade-off as less valuable than older generations.9 Given some Big Tech companies heavy reliance on data informed advertising revenue (95% plus of 2021 revenues for some of the largest companies in our set), there is a strong economic motivation to extract as much user data as possible. Clearly, this impulse runs headfirst into the privacy interests of users and, increasingly, of regulators. × DISPLAY 4: GDPR at a Glance  Source: CMS.Law GDPR Enforcement Tracker (2021), https://www.enforcementtracker.com × DISPLAY 4: GDPR at a Glance Source: CMS.Law GDPR Enforcement Tracker (2021), https://www.enforcementtracker.com ESG Sharpens the Oversight Spotlight These social issues come against the backdrop of ongoing global debate about whether Big Tech’s market power and business practices have become disadvantageous to consumer welfare, competition, and productivity. As it is, Technology is lightly regulated in comparison to other sectors. We believe this is for a variety of reasons. The internet industry is comparatively young and has come to prominence in an era during which American public discourse has opposed industrial regulation as burdensome, innovation limiting instruments. However, growing scrutiny into the business practices of today’s tech titans is seeing bipartisan support emerge in key markets such as the U.S. and Europe to curb their influence. As the negative externalities associated with Big Tech become more widely recognized, the end of the “light touch” internet regulatory regime may be near. Privacy laws limit the flow of data Regulating data sharing via privacy laws is one way to address these concerns. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 137 out of 194 countries have passed legislation designed to protect data and privacy. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) statute, passed in 2016, is among the most comprehensive data privacy laws passed. Among other things, GDPR requires an individual’s consent when using their personal data, thereby giving individuals greater protection and control. Due to its extraterritorial reach, companies based outside the EU can fall in the scope of GDPR if they collect and process an EU citizen’s personal data. Non-compliance with GDPR can result in heavy penalties and reputational damage, including eyewatering fines of up to either €20million or up to 4% of annual global revenue. It should be noted that interpretation of GDPR varies within Europe and while fines have generally been increasing, regulators have shown restraint. No company has been hit with the headline 4% fine yet and few expect that to change. Recent court rulings in Europe continue to make data transfer outside the EU incredibly complex for tech companies operating in the U.S. The Court of Justice of the EU in its Schrems II judgment declared that companies who intend to transfer personal data outside the EU must ensure that GDPR-equivalent protection is provided, or they must suspend the transfer. We expect that the evolution of data protection regulations globally will continue to force changes to company practices, slowing their growth through loss of data, lower efficacy and poorer quality of content. Continued concerns around data collection and the slow rate of change by companies means that a worst-case scenario such as being locked out of markets, while unlikely, should not be entirely dismissed. Investors should be mindful therefore of the fundamental risk that privacy regulations impose. × DISPLAY 5: Dual-Class Structure Trends over time  Source: Ritter, J.

Initial Public Offerings: Dual Class Structure of IPOs Through 2021 (2022). U.S. Antitrust growing FAANGS? Experts believe that Big Tech’s stewardship over large pools of user data confers substantial advantages. They point to the feedback loop conferred on Big Tech through its network effects described earlier. The OECD notes that “the dominant platform may not do anything that can be properly qualified as anti-competitive, and yet the feedback loop can reinforce dominance and prevent rival platforms from gaining customers.” Consequently, many argue that today’s Big Tech companies exert monopoly power that can block competitors and disadvantage users in ways that would not have been permissible for most of the 20th century. Europe once again leads the charge against Big Tech on this front. The EU’s proposed Digital Markets Act seeks to blacklist certain anticompetitive business practices that allegedly have allowed Big Tech to exploit their size and entrench their position as “gatekeepers”. The Act is expected to come in to force at the end of 2022 once approved by both the European Parliament and Council. The U.S. has taken some steps towards addressing Big Tech’s power. We first discussed this in our July 2021 Insight10 where we identified Lina Khan’s appointment to chair the U.S. competition regulator as well as a raft of bills introduced in the U.S. to amend anti-trust law to make enforcement easier. However, despite Europe’s proposals and U.S. tentative steps to curb Big Tech’s power, the limited antitrust risk premium built into these firms’ valuations suggests that few believe today’s tech titans will be brought to heel. On a longer-term basis, we are less sanguine than the market. For instance, over the next 3-4 years, we believe that antitrust developments could hurt the growth prospects for Big Tech companies, particularly when it comes to M&amp;A, which is likely to face intense scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic. Governance Growing Pains Taken together, the recent strengthening of antitrust and privacy enforcement has grown out of these companies’ perceived failure to self-regulate. The failure to self-regulate may reflect a culture where leadership often goes unchallenged. Indeed, decision-making power is often heavily concentrated, with founders exerting significant influence on strategy, be it through force of personality or corporate shareholding structures. Dual class stock, which is prevalent in tech, entitles the owner(s) of certain shares to exercise voting rights at levels that exceed their claim on cash-flow rights. Some believe that this allows a founder or founder group to focus on a more beneficial long-term strategy, rather than being constrained by short-term considerations. Consequently, investors will have to grapple with certain trade-offs. They must assess not only the nature of the shareholdings, but also the nature of the company, industry and controller. And while we agree that simplified control structures may be beneficial in a company’s early growth stages, they place enormous power in the hands of leadership and the select few employees to whom leaders delegate key responsibilities. Given the size and complexity of Big Tech organizations we believe that this concentrated power in should be recognized as a risk. This is exacerbated by the increasing frequency with which these companies find themselves in the regulatory spotlight. Structuring decision-making processes to move away from the narrow views of the few, to incorporate more diverse perspectives, could help to mitigate some of these regulatory and reputational risks. The Investment Outlook for Big Tech While Big Tech has enjoyed a relatively unhindered rise to prominence, the headwinds are getting stronger. In the near term, the macro backdrop of slowing growth, ongoing inflationary pressure and subsequent rising nominal and real rates means that we generally expect developed market growth stocks like Big Tech to underperform. Over the next couple of years we expect that a more challenging operating environment, in the shadow of regulators and competition authorities on both sides of the Atlantic, may limit Big Tech’s growth potential upon which its valuations depend. As outlined throughout this piece, many of the biggest risks facing Big Tech are related to the “S” pillar within ESG. Issues around privacy and social responsibility may not be considered material for a traditional investor, however, an approach that fully integrates ESG could help gain a more thorough understanding of what drives the risks for Big Tech. Given that these companies are the largest constituents in major equity benchmarks, such as the S&amp;P 500, both active and index investors should consider the potential impact of these ESG risks. × 1 However, a number of relatively small companies that exhibit similar business practices focused on data collection share the same ESG risks we touch on 2 Cobbe, J., &amp; Singh, J.

Fed’s hawkish surprise, yet markets unruffled (2021) × Risk Considerations There is no assurance that the Strategy will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser’s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio’s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio’s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. ESG Strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. × Andrew Harmstone Managing Director, Lead Portfolio Manager Global Balanced Risk Control Team Li Zhang Head of ESG, Global Balanced Risk Control team Global Balanced Risk Control Team Kian Masters ESG Analyst Global Balanced Risk Control Team × Christian Goldsmith Managing Director, Lead Portfolio Specialist Global Balanced Risk Control Team",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/shining-a-sustainability-light-on-big-tech.html
"In our view, health care is a natural place to look for high quality, defensive companies. In many cases, revenues and barriers to entry are protected by patents, regulation and long-term contracts. However, the longer-term compounding power of individual companies must be considered on a stock-by-stock basis, as fortunes can diverge materially. × It is not enough to rely on long patent lives, generous pricing and decade-old therapies and frameworks. We look for companies with the ability to innovate, provide new therapies and treatments, and participate in scientific paradigm shifts, all of which may directly impact longer-term earnings power and the ability to sustain high returns on operating capital. One of the most important shifts to consider with respect to our health care companies is the development of “personalised medicine”. Personalised medicine is impacting many parts of the health care value chain, and is paving the way for novel therapies and cures for diseases that were once thought to be incurable. Take for example Usher syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that causes deafness and blindness in young children, for which there is currently no cure. Formulating a cure for diseases such as this will be revolutionary, but the science and technology underpinning it is not new. It lies in the process of “genomic sequencing”, which involves comparing the genetic make-up of someone with a particular disease to that of someone without it, allowing researchers to identify the faulty gene that is the cause. In 1990, sequencing the first human genome cost $5.5 billion and took 13 years. Today it takes less than one day and costs approximately $200. Usher syndrome may be cured when the faulty gene can be replaced with a working one, preventing the onset of symptoms that lead to deafness and blindness. Genomic sequencing has already been central to the development of treatment for certain diseases. Immunotherapy drugs, for example, directly attack cancer in a new way, by altering the expression of cancer genes. Enter the era of personalised medicine: treating patients based on their own genetic make-up, predicted response and risk of disease. × "" Personalised medicine is impacting many parts of the health care value chain, and is paving the way for novel therapies and cures for diseases that were once thought to be incurable One step forward: the promise of personalised medicine The genomic revolution has enabled a shift from a one-size-fits-all approach in health care to a personalised approach. Using the traditional one-size-fits-all approach is like walking into a shoe shop and buying any old pair of shoes without checking the size or trying them on. Personalised medicine is the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual genetic characteristics of each patient and their specific disease. A Swiss multinational pharmaceutical’s Zolgensma is perhaps the most stunning example of gene therapy, which is a specific type of personalised medicine. Zolgensma works by replacing a faulty gene with a working gene and is used as a cure for inherited spinal muscular atrophy in young children. While still in their early development and costly to access, gene therapies hold the promise of being able to cure a variety of medical conditions beyond this point. Another example of personalised medicine is a British-Swedish biopharmaceutical company’s Enhertu. This represents a huge step forward in the war against cancer through the development of personalised medicine. Existing chemotherapies poison healthy cells in the body, in the hope of catching the cancerous ones in the process. Enhertu uses complex technology to deliver chemotherapy only to the cancerous cells: this saves the healthy cells and allows physicians to give more of the highly toxic and powerful drug to a localised site. Enhertu holds the promise of treating very specific types of breast cancer, for which there is negligible existing treatment available. Two steps back: the pitfalls of personalised medicine The development of personalised medicine is a rocky road. Drug developers have faced the usual threats of trial failures where therapies are not effective or safe enough. Even in cases where these drugs make it through trials and are actually approved by regulators, some may carry unwanted side effects. In the case of some gene therapies, only 25% of potential populations are eligible for treatment due to prohibitive cost and safety issues. On top of this, some physicians demand a better track record of safety for the drug before administering a “one-shot cure” that will affect the patient for life and cannot be reversed. For conditions like haemophilia, patients may prefer to stay on existing treatments and wait 10 to 20 years to see how the hoped-for cure is working. However, not all patients have this luxury. Children with inherited spinal muscular atrophy have a life expectancy of just two years, meaning Zolgensma is potentially life-saving. For some, the step forward is worth the risk. The impact of the personalised medicine revolution on investing in the health care sector What do these promises and risks around personalised medicine mean for stock-picking opportunities in health care? We do not believe in owning individual companies on the basis that they are developing a specific drug. Single drug companies (such as early stage biotechs) are on the front line of progress and drug development, but are also the first to suffer from the setbacks. Single drug investments also carry significant concentration risk and do not necessarily translate into longer-term compounding power, particularly once the drug goes off patent (roughly 10 years after approval). Fortunately, this revolution is not limited to the drugs themselves. The shift to personalised medicine requires extensive adaptations in the way that health care is provided, paid for and monitored, resulting in second and third derivative health care beneficiaries that offer investment opportunities. As treatments become more targeted and complex, so too does the way diseases are diagnosed and monitored. How do you know which therapy to give a patient if you are not able to properly classify the specific type of disease? Diagnostics drive 70% of treatment decisions, and if treatments are changing, diagnostics must change with them. Diagnostic testing is crucial for health economics. If physicians are able to correctly identify the relevant marker of disease through testing, health care systems do not waste drugs on patients who would never have responded to the drug in the first place. The likes of a U.S. diversified health care company and a U.S. diversified science and technology company are at the forefront of developing molecular diagnostic tests that are used in assessing a patient’s individual suitability for personalised medicines. Diagnostics companies carry the benefit of having exposure to the trend of increasingly complex drug development, without the associated risks of trial failures, patent expiries and pricing pressures. Health care has made massive strides in the development and delivery of personalised medicine. Revolutionary benefits to patients are also bolstering the compounding potential of these high quality investments. × Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy’s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. × Helena Miles Senior Associate International Equity Team Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Previous Next",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/one-step-forward-two-steps-back.html

"One of the oldest investment axioms for market experts is to never set a price target and attach a date to when it happens. The market is a humbling beast that delights in making the supposed “smart money” look foolish. Anyone who is arrogant in the investment business is either too new or about to be colossally wrong. Yet as a portfolio manager of equity funds, I must have a market view. Quite simply, the concept of “just pick stocks and ignore the noise” sounds great in theory. However, too much of a stock’s return is explained by macro inputs to simply put on blinders regarding the market. The painful unwind of the uber growth stocks over the past six months has had far less to do with stock specific problems and a lot more to do with a massively shifting macro environment that is no longer willing to stomach sky high valuations. With that prelude, and 36 years of the market consistently reminding me of my place in its world, what follows is my best guess for the remainder of 2022. Overall, I remain cautious as we head into the summer, yet optimistic about a rally from the expected summer market lows through the end of the year. Regarding my cautious stance heading into the summer: In my opinion, we have not yet hit maximum growth scare hyperbole (“recession coming, look out below”). Here are some of the maximum growth scare signals we are watching for: VIX &gt;40…. not there yet. GS Financial Conditions Index tighten to over 100…. not there yet. Put/call ratio reflecting extreme investor anxiety…. building. High yield spreads to Treasuries blowing out…. not there yet. Fund flows turn very negative…. not there yet. CTA trend-followers have all but given up on equities…. in process. Typically, with this level of volatility in bonds, currencies and stocks, something breaks. Hedge fund blow-up? Debt default? Who knows? I think a maximum growth scare will happen when the Fed actually begins the more aggressive rate increases. I do suspect we are nearing a short-term bottom for the market: Stock buybacks are collectively the number one buyer of stocks. The window for stock buybacks will largely reopen, having been closed for much of April. Corporate fundamentals in the Q1 earnings season, overall, were simply too strong to scare off the bulls. Investor optimism is very low, and that is a contrarian indicator. With increased expectations of a hawkish Fed, investors could positively react to any more balanced-stance signal from Powell. The annual lows during a mid-term year have pretty consistently arrived in the summer. I continue to believe 4,050 is an attractive initial entry point for the S&amp;P 500 and 3,850 is a distinct possibility. Regarding being optimistic following a potential summer low and a buyer at that level: Corporate and individual balance sheets remain too strong for us to experience more than a growth “scare”. We do expect inflation to subside. Therefore, Wall Street is likely to, yet again, overestimate the degree of Fed tightening. If inflation subsides as recession fears fade, the setup for an equity market rally exists. However, at this juncture, it’s premature to expect more than an oversold bounce. During a mid-term year, Q4 has historically been the best quarter, as the incumbent party refocuses on “stimulus” (passing out the candy) in front of the upcoming Presidential campaign. While the full year S&amp;P 500 return could be lackluster from the 4,778 level on January 1st, 2022, the upside potential from those targeted lows would be quite attractive. Yet, sadly, here is what I am highly confident will occur: Investors cumulatively won’t be buyers into a summer low. Instead, they will hit the panic button to sell at exactly the wrong time. Here are our current thoughts regarding portfolio positioning: It’s too late to buy defensives. The time to buy defensives is when the market is soaring and nobody wants them, as happened at the end of 2021. Our portfolios have been underweight growth stocks. That is changing, given the magnitude of growth underperformance relative to the market. Therefore, using defensive positions as a source of funds, we are actively preparing a list of quality growth stocks to potentially add into this next leg lower for the market, with the following characteristics: phenomenal long-term track records of profitability outpacing their peers. no fundamental problems in their businesses. down over 20%+ from their highs. reasonable (do not have to be cheap) valuations. While now is too early to pull the trigger, we do think that a great opportunity is nearing. × Andrew Slimmon Head of Applied Equity Advisors Team Applied Equity Advisors Team Global Concentrated Portfolio MLNIX | Class I Global Core Portfolio MLMIX | Class I US Core Portfolio MUOIX | Class I Previous Next",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/equity-market-commentary-may-2022.html
"As companies continue to adapt to the changed world of work caused by the global pandemic, the need to prioritize gender-focused diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies remain as important as ever. In this Q&amp;A, Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s Seema Hingorani, Marte Borhaug and Yijia Chen share their views on the vital role gender diversity plays in companies. They discuss where progress can still be made, why they believe leadership teams should think beyond quotas, and how an engaged investor can advance a gender equality agenda. × Why does gender diversity, equity and inclusion matter for you as an investor? MARTE BORHAUG (MB): It is quite simple, really. In addition to being the right thing to do, gender inclusion is good for business, which makes it good for us as investors. For many, this seems self-evidently true, but others will naturally want to see the research, of which there is plenty. For example, one of the most quoted studies, by McKinsey, finds that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams are 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the bottom quartile.1 As an investor, I think it’s important to understand why we see this outperformance. What are the specific drivers? There are many reasons. I will mention two here. For starters, gender diversity helps to promote innovation. A study by the Boston Consulting Group found that companies with leadership teams that have above-average diversity generate, through product innovation, revenues that are 19 percentage points superior to companies with less diverse leadership teams, and enjoy earnings, before taxes and interest, that are 9 percentage points higher.2 And it's not just earnings. According to a study by MSCI, boards with higher levels of gender diversity tend to experience fewer instances of governance-related controversies, including bribery, corruption and fraud.3 In summary, research shows that companies with above average gender representation are better able to solve problems creatively, bounce back from failings and turn challenges into opportunities. As investors, we believe these qualities make more diverse companies more attractive for investment. × "" Research shows that companies with above-average gender representation are better able to solve problems creatively, bounce back from failings and turn challenges into opportunities. YIJIA CHEN (YC): I agree, studies have shown that gender diversity is a material factor to company performance across countries and sectors. Interestingly, the McKinsey study shows that the rewards and penalties that accrue to the best and worst performers compound over time, and can lead to dramatically different long-term performance. Echoing Marte’s points about potential drivers, we believe companies that demonstrate leading or improving DEI practices can attract and retain better talent, which promotes productivity that can help the company position better for longterm value creation. Lastly, diverse viewpoints can be additive to the decision-making process precisely because they bring in new perspectives and challenge traditional thinking. SEEMA HINGORANI (SH): Different perspectives are particularly important for risk management, in my opinion. The global financial crisis is a case in point. Within markets, we saw a situation where the same type of people were making the same types of decisions, resulting in groupthink. When I founded Girls Who Invest, a nonprofit organization designed to bring more young women into investment management careers, the need to challenge traditional thinking, as Yijia said, was very much in my mind. In the curriculum, we teach the core finance and investment concepts that are necessary for successful internships, but we also focus on educating our scholars on market events like what happened in 2008. The idea is to make sure that these young women are well prepared to enter the industry and understand that their voices are needed at the decision-making table to help make sure that this kind of crisis does not happen again. In your view, is the business case for gender equity well understood by corporate leaders today? MB: To be blunt, no. While there are leaders doing the right thing, if all corporate leaders really understood the business case, we would see a very different reality on company boards and in senior management. Unfortunately, diversity still doesn’t seem to get the right kind of attention or be considered a business necessity. For example, some corporate leaders argue the business case is wrong because appointing a woman to the board does not magically improve performance. Clearly, single appointments alone are unlikely to achieve such an outcome, but broader diversity within the top leadership, middle management and overall workforce will lead to different ways of thinking and ultimately in our opinion help improve performance, even if not immediately. Tackling diversity may also be difficult, as challenging traditional thinking and groupthink naturally creates discomfort. Leaders committed to DEI must be prepared to confront these growing pains. I also believe that some corporate leaders are at risk of “gender complacency.” Companies may get to 30% or more of representation on their boards and then consider it a job well done. But we’ve still got a long way to go. If you look at most businesses, very few can claim to be at parity in representation at every level across the organization. Proclaiming the gender question resolved is a problem because, although we are on a good path, a lot of work remains to be done to ensure everyone has the same opportunity to succeed regardless of their gender. SH: Ultimately, diversity is about making business better and not about social good. It seems that some leaders still feel obligated to prioritize diversity on moral grounds, but they should not lose sight of the fact that gender diversity can make businesses better. I’ve been encouraged by the progress that I’ve seen in the last five to 10 years, but there are still some who look at this as ticking a box and filling quotas. For instance, we frequently see situations where a company that is eager to recruit a woman to the board only seek out candidates with prior board experience since that appears as a safer approach. As a result, we see a small pool of the same women sitting on five or more company boards, which does little to expand the opportunity set of talented and diverse female voices in the corporate sector more broadly. YC: Understanding of the business case varies significantly across the world. We know that European countries are the leaders for gender representation in senior positions, but progress elsewhere is sometimes overlooked. In Asia, for instance, Japan lags developed markets’ peers in gender representation,4 but nascent changes are taking place. More and more, Japanese companies are making their first female board appointments. In fact, the share of Japanese companies with at least one woman on the board has increased to 88% from 67% over a three-year period.5 South Korea, meanwhile, is experiencing a similar trend. In 2019, more than 77% of companies had all-male boards. Now, it is about 41%.6 Clearly, more work remains to be done, but the trend is headed in the right direction. As the business case becomes better understood in more countries, we expect the focus to grow beyond board and executive representation to include company policies that affect gender diversity outcomes. Pay equity is an obvious one, but there are many others. Are companies doing enough to address the gender gap at the C-suite and board levels? SH: Companies are improving, but can do more. Screening criteria, for instance, has historically required board candidates to have a certain level of experience, including CEO experience. However, the top ranks of companies are not very gender diverse, which can create a Catch-22 situation, wherein poor gender representation among chief executives begets poor gender representation on boards. The stringent requirements exclude many talented people with other relevant experience. A candidate with profit-and-loss responsibilities, a valuable skill in the corporate sector, for example, could be a complement to many boards, given the opportunity. MB: There has been improvement at board level, in part because board diversity became a focus for investors and regulators. Here, the next step is to start broadening representation to include women from different backgrounds. Going forward, I expect to see more focus on executive teams, which lag behind boards. For example, female board representation is around 40% in the U.K., up from roughly 12% a decade ago.7 In contrast, at the executive level, representation has remained stubbornly low at 22% in recent years with very little improvement, and there are still companies with entirely male executive committees. × "" The top ranks of companies are not very gender diverse, which can create a Catch-22 situation, wherein poor gender representation among chief executives begets poor gender representation on boards. The so-called “Peter Problem” encapsulates this gender disparity well. Few people know that there are actually more CEOs named Peter leading top U.K. companies than female CEOs.8 In the U.S., a similar problem exists, with CEOs named David outnumbering total female counterparts in the S&amp;P 500. This is clearly far away from the levels of diversity we would want to see. YC: Companies can do more than solely targeting gender quotas, but that will require a deeper commitment and change in corporate culture. Norway is one of the countries leading the way in gender diversity. As of today, Calvert’s own research finds Norwegian large-cap companies have the highest female board representation on average among their peers.9 A recent study10 finds that mandatory quotas have been the biggest spur to progress in female board representation within Norwegian public companies, going from 6% in 2002 to 42% in 2016. However, the ripple effects have been pretty slow with public companies faring far better than their private counterparts with regards to gender equity at board level.11 This is also true for U.S. companies—nearly half of private company boards are all male, while 100% of S&amp;P 500 companies’ boards include at least one woman.12 Anecdotal evidence shows that cultural attitudes play important roles. For instance, we have seen a number of high-profile occurrences where female CEOs are parachuted in after corporate crises, typically, DEI-related crises. Sometimes these new leaders manage to rescue the companies, while others come in too late or face internal opposition that stymies change. In the end, appointing a new CEO alone cannot change corporate culture or a company’s fortunes, if everything else remains unchanged. More broadly, what steps can companies take to improve gender equity? SH: Developing the talent pipeline is critical. Companies have to broaden their scope for recruitment to attract candidates with different backgrounds and experiences. To reflect on our own experience at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, we have found that diversity in the workforce enhances our investment capabilities—whether that be in better understanding the end markets of a publicly traded company or helping to facilitate deal origination in private markets. As a firm, we partner with great nonprofit organizations to help foster the next generation of talent. Girls Who Invest, Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, the Toigo Foundation and the Greenwood Project are just some of the nonprofit organizations. These organizations aim to engage women early, oftentimes during high school and university, to foster that talent pipeline for our own industry. MB: We need more initiatives designed to change not just the player but transform the game. Traditionally, diversity efforts have focused on helping the player—i.e., supporting women to develop through mentoring and training. To be clear, these initiatives can be useful steps; however, research has shown that the problem isn’t that women aren’t qualified or don’t have the right aspirations, but that leaders must also look at processes such as recruiting, interviewing and career advancement, among others, to address how we provide unseen talent an opportunity to shine. Unless we look at the rules of the game, we are not going to see the improved outcomes that diversity can bring to a company—the type of outcomes that we, as investors, are seeking. YC: In addition to recruitment, we are seeing companies introduce workplace diversity councils and networks, not solely for gender but for all types of diversity, such as racial/ethnic, sexual orientation, gender identity, disabilities. There are also many group activities focused on intersectionality as an individual’s identity is multidimensional. With the growth in DEI efforts, it is becoming clearer that companies must commit dedicated resources. Frequently, members of the underrepresented groups will volunteer and take responsibility to change the organization’s diversity culture, a role that is in addition to their day job. It is therefore important to understand not only what these companies are doing, but also how specifically the leadership teams are supporting these actions, for example, by recognizing and compensating the time and work contributed by employees involved. What role can large company shareholders play to change the situation? YC: At Calvert, we have always valued the power of proxy voting to hold boards accountable for their attention to diversity. While we have exercised this power for three decades, in recent years, we have placed an added emphasis on DEI to strengthen our proxy voting guidelines. For example, if a company has fewer than two women on the board, Calvert’s guidelines would direct us to vote against reelecting the board directors who serve on the nomination committee. Thus, proxy voting can act as a potent tool in directly challenging board leaders who have failed to prioritize gender diversity. In addition, for companies in the U.S., the U.K., Australia and Canada, Calvert will vote against the nominating committee at companies that have fewer than two people from racially or ethnically underrepresented groups or that are less than 40% diverse. We will also vote against the chair of certain boards that do not disclose racial diversity information. × "" Proxy voting can act as a potent tool in directly challenging board leaders who have failed to prioritize gender diversity. Another important area where shareholders can advocate change is transparency. For this reason, Calvert launched a campaign to facilitate EEO-1 disclosure in July 2020. The campaign targets the largest 100 U.S. companies and advocates for the disclosure of their EEO-1 reports, which are mandatory demographic reports collected by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of the U.S. government. At the beginning, only 16 companies were making their data public. We engaged the other 84 companies and, today, nearly 90 of our target companies publish the report. In fact, now, about half of S&amp;P 500 companies disclose, demonstrating the power of engagement. MB: As an equity investor in large public companies, it is important to evaluate every potential investee company’s DEI approach to assess the risks and identify possible areas for engagement should we invest. For example, in the recent past, we engaged with a large spirits and wine company based in Europe. Despite being a global company, with a vast geographical footprint, particularly in emerging markets, the company had an all-white European board. We saw this as an opportunity to discuss the benefits of diversity in their leadership and urged the company to diversify their board. We were pleased to see that last year the company appointed a woman of Indian heritage with business experience from Asia, including Australia, Malaysia and Myanmar. Her nomination adds a unique perspective to the board, helps broaden the company’s horizon and thinking and brings valuable business experience. These types of examples show that on a one-on-one basis, engagement can help to influence change. Joining forces with like-minded investors can also be highly effective to compel companies to change. To this end, in the U.K., Morgan Stanley Investment Management recently joined the 30% Club Investor Group, which comprises 42 financial investors representing more than £20 trillion in assets under management. The group has engaged with U.K. companies for the last decade to improve board and executive gender representation. More recently, it has put out a race equity statement calling on companies to do more to improve race and ethnic diversity and will be engaging with investee companies to improve their DEI disclosure, strategy and outcomes. Working with groups such as these can be a powerful driver of change across a whole market or industry. We know this because we have seen it work. SH: If we step back to think about environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, the “E” and the “G” are often easier to measure and thus to highlight and talk about. We can count carbon reduction to assess climate impact, for example, and we can look at the proportion of women on boards when we think about corporate governance. The “S” is more difficult to measure, but it is a large part of what we are discussing here today. How do we treat our people? How does this impact the women in our workforce? The pandemic has brought home the importance of confronting “S” issues for corporate leaders. They have had a duty to ensure that workers are kept secure and safe. They have had to look at policies around caregiving, as it relates to childcare or even elder care, which affects the growing number of us who have aging parents. These types of “S” policies are not easy to measure, but have to be looked at and analyzed, which is what Marte, Yijia and I do as part of our jobs every day. For firms, this is critically important right now. In the aftermath of the pandemic, fewer women are returning to the workforce relative to men, a sign of sliding backward. Returning to the points made at the beginning of our discussion around the importance of gender diversity to performance outcomes, we need to ask ourselves: “Do we really want to see women dropping out?” Of course not. In order to remain competitive, we need to be harnessing that talent. By spending more time focused on the “S” issues, I think that women, companies and investors will all be better off. × 1 McKinsey &amp; Company. “Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters.” (May 2020). 2 Rocío Lorenzo, Nicole Voigt, Miki Tsusaka, Matt Krentz, and Katie Abouzahr, ""How Diverse Leadership Teams Boost Innovation"", Boston Consulting Group, 2018. 3 Linda-Eling, Lee Ric Marshall, Damion Rallis, Matt Moscardi. “Women on Boards: Global Trends in Gender Diversity on Corporate Boards,” November 2015. 4 Calvert blog: Japan Makes Strides in Female Board Diversity https://www. calvert.com/impact.php?filter=chris__madden#japan-makes-strides-infemale-board-diversity.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. In general, equity securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income.

"In a month where most global assets tumbled across both equities and fixed income, positioning in the bright spots of commodities and UK equities, all of which were up over the month, offered some cushion. As anticipated, markets took another leg lower. The S&amp;P 500 had the worst performance of the major developed markets, down -8.7% (USD), with the MSCI Europe holding up better, down -0.5% (EUR) after a relief rally1. After a brief reprieve in March, the MSCI Japan continued its downward trajectory, -2.7% (JPY)1. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index also fared worse at -5.5%1 (USD). The VIX reflected the volatility, spiking to 33 at month end1. Bonds underperformed equities, as the US 10-year Treasury yield continued to move higher to 2.9%1 by April end. × Are investors underestimating Fed tightening? At 8.5%2, US headline inflation is at a 40-year high and continues to accelerate. Investors still appear to be underestimating the amount of tightening necessary to cool inflation. Given continued inflationary pressures from an ultra-tight US labour market, energy and food price increases, the terminal rate of the current hiking cycle should exceed consensus expectations and what markets are currently pricing. The Fed Fund futures are indicating a terminal Fed Funds rate of 3.25%3. We believe the risks remain skewed to the upside and expect a terminal rate of at least 3.50% is required to keep inflation under control. This points to further downside pressure on US treasury bonds. Europe is less exposed to rate rises compared with the US, but inflation is still running unacceptably high, exacerbated by exposure to Russia-Ukraine. Inflation: to settle at elevated levels Whilst inflation should eventually stabilise, in the short-term China’s lockdowns are impacting supply chains. We believe inflation is likely to settle at elevated levels, above the Fed’s 2% target, as deflationary trends over the past decade, such as globalisation reverse and commodity supply shortages sustain upward pressure on prices. This has implications on equities, as higher real yields and inflation act as headwinds to equity valuations and earnings. Tighter margins, given pressures on wages and input costs, may not be passed to the consumer, as they too take a hit from increasing oil and food prices. Investment Implications Given the uncertain environment and potential for spikes in volatility, we have maintained our defensive, low equity positioning since last month. Portfolios managed by the GBaR team which permit options, benefitted from our enhanced tail risk hedging strategy, as they pulled the portfolios further out of equities as markets fell. Towards the end of the month, we reconciled the options and the target equity weight, increasing these portfolios’ equity weights to ensure they are in line. We made tactical changes, adding those which should benefit from the commodity theme, such as Brazil - a large commodity exporter. We are underweight Europe versus the US, due to the former’s increased recession risk, given exposure to Russia-Ukraine conflict. We made adjustments to bond exposures, reducing duration, given further Fed tightening and potential downside for bonds. Eurozone equities We initially reduced eurozone equities in March and after the recent relief rally, moved from neutral to underweight in April. There appears to be limited upside for stocks and significant tail risks, including a potential consumption-led slowdown, rising inflation pressures and margin compression on equities. Brazilian equities We moved overweight Brazilian equities, which should benefit from persistently high commodity prices on a tight market and positive terms of trade. A peak in the Selic rate in 2H 2022 should also support earnings growth, while valuations and sentiment remain supportive, despite the rally year-to-date. Emerging market local debt We moved overweight short duration commodity-exporting high yielders. A selection of Latin American, South African and Indonesian high yielders are likely to benefit from positive terms of trade given the rally in commodities. A rollover of inflation is also likely to offer positive real yield. We expressed this through adding to the emerging market local debt basket. European high Yield We moved from overweight to neutral European high yield, moving into cash for now. We believe the risk-reward has turned negative after the recent aggressive tightening in spreads towards the 10-year average level, leaving them slightly rich compared with European investment grade spreads. US duration Whilst we briefly increased duration last month, we reversed this in April, moving from neutral to underweight. Given current inflationary trends, we believe the market is still pricing an excessively low Fed funds terminal rate. Additionally, as the effects of Quantitative Tightening manifest in supply and demand balances, risks to long-term yields remain skewed to the downside. US 10-year breakeven We moved overweight to neutral, through removal of TIPS and positioned in short dated 1-3 year US treasuries or cash. As TIPS have an average maturity of 7-8 years, this reduction is in line with our move to underweight duration. JPY/USD We moved underweight Japanese Yen relative to the US dollar. Despite the weakening Yen, the Bank of Japan is likely to remain reluctant to change their policy to support their currency, as Japan’s recovery remains subdued. Furthermore, importers are selling the Yen to pay for increasingly expensive imports and exports remain constrained by supply chain disruptions in key industries. If this continues, real money selling could remain an issue. Industrial Metals For portfolios which held industrial metals through an ETF, we have removed the position and place this into cash for now.

Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser’s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio’s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio’s performance.

"Company culture, the shared values and behaviors that define how employees collaborate to create value for the enterprise, remains an enigma in the field of investing. Analysts intuitively understand its influence on investment outcomes and nod knowingly when presented with examples of effective or bad cultures. But measuring culture is a subjective exercise that is open to wide interpretation, even among employees at the same company. Culture has defied quantification at a time when researchers are numerically modeling every factor that has an impact on investment performance. × In the late 1970s, tangible investments were nearly twice those of intangible investments. Today, intangible investments are roughly one and a half times those of tangible investments. This shift has transformed the nature of business. We believe our economy’s transformation from tangible to intangible assets is secular and early in its course. As a result, investors will increasingly recognize culture as a critical determinant of value creation. That means it will be the subject of critical analysis and measurement in years to come. Given this reality, we reviewed legacy frameworks to quantify culture and found them to be well intentioned but generally inconsistent. They were also far too broad in their scope. We believe a new approach can add value. We studied how KPIs have evolved, how they are used, and what impact they have had. Our goal is to simplify the complex topic and to create a standard set of tools that investors can use to evaluate a company’s intangible assets. We have identified employee retention as a significant indicator of culture.

"The U.S. has made progress adding women to the executive suite, but new analysis shows that we still have a massive power imbalance across public companies and are unlikely to achieve the benefits of gender diversity with this ongoing problem. The conditions in society have changed, and public companies are lagging far behind in their internal demographics and power dynamics. While progress among public companies has been made to increase representation of women at varying levels, the power dynamic has remained largely unchanged at the top. The data on gender balance in the U.S. establishes an imperative for companies to improve on creating the right work environment for women. Therefore, more must be done by responsible investors to help companies improve and get on the right side of these very obvious and powerful trends. × Click to see full paper .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:fit-content; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } John Streur President and CEO, Calvert Research and Management",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/addressing-the-gender-power-imbalance-in-the-executive-suite.html
"In March we celebrated International Women’s Day, and Women’s History Month, so as a team we wanted to address the subject of diversity, and how we approach engaging on it. Across the globe, stakeholders are pushing employers for greater transparency and accountability for diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&amp;I), with heightened expectations for specific targets, concrete action plans and demonstrable improvement. The business case. McKinsey’s 2020 report, “Diversity Matters: How Inclusion Wins,” finds that companies in the top quartile for gender diverse executive teams were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile.1 According to Boston Consulting Group research, companies with above-average diversity on their leadership teams generated higher revenue from innovation—19 percentage points more than at companies with homogenous leadership teams—and delivered higher EBIT margins.2 Research by MSCI found that boards with higher levels of gender diversity tend to experience fewer instances of business misconduct, such as corruption, bribery and fraud.3 The findings are equally compelling for ethnic and cultural diversity. McKinsey’s study found that the most ethnically diverse executive teams outperformed the least diverse executive teams by 36% in terms of profitability in 2019. In fact, according to its analysis, there continues to be a higher likelihood of outperformance difference with ethnicity than with gender.4 Testing for DE&amp;I is hard. The lack of data is a real problem. Shifting goal posts, national differences and varying regional regulatory developments all contribute to the complexity of pinning down what can be measured. For example, gender pay gap (GPG) data in the U.K. is useful insofar as it provides a high-level overview of gender inequality, but its lack of granularity and limitation in scope makes it difficult to diagnose why pay disparities exist. In the U.S., while companies are required to report intersectional diversity data captured by the mandatory Employer Information Report (EEO-1), only a handful of companies disclose this information publicly.5 Making things even harder, in many countries it is illegal for companies to ask employees to disclose their race and/or ethnicity, and many don’t have GPG reporting requirements. The fact is women and minorities are underrepresented at senior levels of most companies and in the broader workforce across many industries. Other than the obvious negative impact on human capital development for women, there’s the economic issue: the pay gap. The World Economic Forum 2021 “Global Gender Gap Report” shows the global wage gap is currently 37%, while the income gap (the ratio of the total wage and non-wage income of women to that of men) is close to 51%.6 It’s not just gender. Black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups are typically underrepresented throughout organisations, and most acutely at senior levels. According to a study by Mercer, in the U.S., the most dramatic decrease in representation is among Black/African American employees, who make up 12% of support staff roles but account for a mere 2% of executive level positions.7 Taking the pulse. Of course, inclusion stretches beyond statistics and into culture. According to a global survey by Qualtrics, an “experience management” specialist, only 37% of workers say their company culture has improved since the beginning of the pandemic, implying 63% see no improvement or worse.8 Investing in “experience management” solutions helps managers and human resources leaders to listen to employees, allowing them to take insight-based action to improve employee experience and engagement. This goes beyond providing training to actively soliciting feedback and creating an environment of trust. Incentivising for outcomes. According to research by Deloitte, reviewing proxy statements between February 2020 and January 2021, fewer than 40% of Fortune 100 companies incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures in their executive incentive plans. Of those that had, social metrics were the most frequent, followed by environmental.9 Within social, DE&amp;I metrics were the most common – so it’s a relatively good start for DE&amp;I – but in an absolute context, most companies are yet to embrace environment and social (E&amp;S ) incentives, meaning leadership lack accountability for delivery of DE&amp;I objectives. So how do we approach DE&amp;I with our holdings? It is hard to get a view from the outside, so in our opinion, direct engagement with management is the best route. Our DE&amp;I engagement checklist includes: Has the company conducted a comprehensive pay equity and pay gap analysis? Does management align DE&amp;I with executive compensation? If not, why? Does the company have a hiring policy requiring a gender diverse slate of candidates for all leadership positions (e.g., 30% must be female)? Does the company have a hiring policy ensuring candidates are not required to disclose past pay information? Does the company have processes in place to ensure job descriptions are gender neutral? Does the company regularly train recruitment professionals and interviewers to focus on more inclusive recruitment efforts? Does the company actively develop female talent through a leadership development programme or equivalent? Does the company provide sufficient flexible working and parental leave to both parents? Does the company use employee engagement surveys, and with what frequency? Does the company offer a “Returnship” programme for females following a career break? What is the return rate from parental leave? U.S. companies: Is EEO-1 representation data disclosed? If not, why? A focus on engagement leading to outcomes. With two of our global beverage companies, we have been pressing for some time to see the board diversify away from being all European to more representative of its underlying markets. We are pleased to see real change happening, given new appointments. On data, we engaged with one of our medical technology holdings to discuss a shareholder proposal —which we supported—calling for a report on racial justice and disclosure of EEO-1 gender and ethnic diversity data. Given the company reports EEO-1 data to the U.S. government, we questioned why it didn’t disclose it publicly. It now plans to disclose some EEO-1 data as part of its new D&amp;I report. With another holding, the world’s leading digital and management consultancy, we looked to understand how it expects to reach its targets of 50/50 workforce gender parity by 2025 and attain 30% women managing directors by 2025. To help get there, the firm targets that each of the U.S., the U.K. and South Africa operations have ethnic representation targets; the use of diverse candidate slates is standard, managers are accountable for promoting diversely and flexible working provisions are in place—all of which we applaud. However, we challenged the company with our concerns about working conditions in its content moderation business and we will continue to monitor this. Where next? Along with pushing for data, better transparency, aligned incentives and credible pathways for change, our DE&amp;I engagements also encourage our portfolio companies to consider how greater diversity links to business strategy. Closer to home. Like our holdings, we are on our own journey. Today, just under a third of the investors on the team are female, from none a few years ago, and 46% of the combined Investor and Portfolio Specialist team is female. Of our eight managing directors, three are female. Leading on DE&amp;I, senior Portfolio Manager and Managing Director Bruno Paulson heads the MSIM EMEA Diversity Focus Counci; Managing Director Laura Bottega steered MSIM to win the 2019 Investment Week Contribution to Diversity Award (U.K.) for promoting gender diversity within our business, and Executive Director Marte Borhaug, Head of Sustainable Outcomes, sits as Co-Chair of the 30% Club, the investor group encouraging U.K. firms to be more diverse and inclusive. × 1 McKinsey &amp; Company, Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters, 2020. 2 Rocío Lorenzo, Nicole Voigt, Miki Tsusaka, Matt Krentz, and Katie Abouzahr, ‘How Diverse Leadership Teams Boost Innovation’, BCG, 2018.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy’s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. × Bruno Paulson Managing Director International Equity Team Marte Borhaug Head of Sustainable Outcomes International Equity Team Alistair Corden-Lloyd Executive Director Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Previous Next",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/diversity-asking-difficult-questions.html
"In today’s market, the great majority of ESG metrics concerns operations: activities that happen within the company’s control. The next major milestone for ESG metrics, in our view, involves impact: how companies affect society and the environment through their employees, customers and products.

"March was another brutal month for financial markets, capping one of the worst quarters since the 1980s. The “safe-haven” status of government bonds, evident as Russia invaded Ukraine, proved ephemeral as the end of February rally quickly reversed and turned into a large March sell-off. Indeed, it did not take long for markets to realize the inflationary/stagflationary implications of the war and resulting sanctions on Russia. × The negative growth implications were ignored as the new shock was going to exacerbate inflationary conditions already on the boil from an overheating global economy beset with supply chain disruptions. Market expectations of central bank rate hikes ratcheted higher, sending global bond yields spiraling upwards: the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield rose 90 basis points (bps) while the 2-year German government bond yield moved into positive territory for the first time since 2014. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s (Fed’s) March meeting was notable in that it resulted in a massive increase in its year-end inflation and rates forecast, justifying the market’s bearishness. The extent of the shift in monetary policy in 2022 is breathtaking by historical standards. Unlike in February, credit markets somewhat surprisingly outperformed governments with high yield (HY) and emerging market (EM) external debt spreads tightening meaningfully, correcting a significant portion of their February underperformance. HY and EM external lead the way, outperforming with spreads 30-64 bps tighter. Despite the negative implications of the war for the global economy, the U.S. dollar was mixed. European currencies fell modestly, and the Japanese yen was the big loser as the Bank of Japan (BoJ) made it clear it had no intention of following other central banks in tightening policy. EM currencies continued to do well, with Latin America leading the way. Reduced liquidity in financial markets was also noteworthy, exacerbating swings in prices, frequently on a daily basis. × DISPLAY 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date  Note: USD-based performance.

Fixed Income Outlook The Russian invasion of the Ukraine has further intensified existing imbalances in the global economy. The impact will likely be felt through an elongation and intensification of the inflation cycle and falling growth rates (though no recession). Inflation has moved up as have expectations through 2023. Commodity and food prices are likely to go higher still, exacerbating existing inflation problems, making central banks continue their hawkish jawboning and actions. The Fed is notable in this regard. It is very possible it hikes 250 bps this year as it front loads tightening while the economy is strong and shows its commitment to a credible anti-inflation strategy. There is absolutely no doubt in our minds that policy was too easy for too long (especially given the Covid-inspired fiscal policy response) and the Fed needs to “catch up” and get policy to neutral as fast as possible. This may even necessitate multiple 50 bps rate hikes in contiguous months AND sooner than expected balance sheet runoff. So far markets have taken this well, with credit spreads widening relatively modestly and the dollar only marginally stronger. However, if inflation does not fall enough (yet to be defined, but probably no higher than the Fed’s current end of year forecast), expect additional unexpected tightening next year, i.e., a much higher terminal Fed funds rate. This would raise the probability of a recession in 2023 and undermine credit assets. The Fed’s hawkishness is mirrored across the globe. Indeed, EM central banks have been fighting inflation for over a year. In the case of Eastern Europe, rate hikes have accelerated in recent weeks as has the ECB’s hawkish comments. This global synchronization of policy (outside of China and Japan) alongside stubborn inflation will, we believe, push yields higher globally. Even countries like Australia, where central banks have resisted raising rates, are experiencing very sharp increases in longer-maturity yields. Until inflation has peaked (or a recession is anticipated), which we will not know for several months, we expect yields to remain under upwards pressure. One reason central banks can be this hawkish is growth is strong. Although inflation is acting as a tax on households and businesses and yields are moving higher, labor markets and corporate profitability are strongly supporting spending. Thus, given the current level and trajectory of yields we do not anticipate a recession either this year or next. The earliest it could happen based on our analysis is 2024. This is a long way off and supports a more 1994 interpretation of this year’s rate hiking cycle as one that will slow things down enough to contain inflation without throwing the U.S. or global economy into a recession. We have to keep in mind that the global economy is decelerating from a very high level. That said, regional issues will occur. The probability of economic underperformance is greatest in Europe and China/ ASEAN. The U.S. will likely remain the growth leader. As a result, corporate profitability is likely to be varied. The energy, commodities, and defense sectors are likely to benefit; Healthcare and Telecoms will be least affected, and for Utilities it will depend on their exact regulatory and commodity exposure. Both industrial and consumer sectors will be negatively affected, but at least they were experiencing strong demand going into the crisis. However, there is no denying that the impact will be negative, with European corporates more affected. That said spreads are wider than the beginning of the year with notable underperformance of Europe. Credit fundamentals are mixed. Credit quality is mixed in terms of profitability, earnings have likely peaked, and leverage and margins are plateauing. But balance sheets, liquidity and debt servicing capacity remain exceptionally strong. And, importantly, we still expect very benign defaults and more upgrades than downgrades. We therefore think corporate credit remains sound and would look to add to positions on pull backs. That said, due to central banks’ new-found commitment to contain and reduce inflation over the next 18 months, growth will weaken and it will be important to differentiate those companies who can continue to thrive in such an environment. Active management is likely to be key to performance. We do maintain a preference at the margin for high yield over investment grade but that is very idiosyncratic and industry specific. EM outperformed recently. This is due to valuations, EM underperformed much of the last 12 months; big regional disparities, Latin America benefitting economically at the margin from the war (even if inflation cycle lengthens a bit); and, commodity exporters benefitting, like Brazil and South Africa. We think this trend is likely to continue. Country level analysis will be vital to uncover value as we expect markets to place an emphasis on differentiation amongst countries and credits. Developed Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW In March, repricing of central bank policy expectations resulted in a global sell-off in developed market rates. The movement included historic increases in front-end rates, a positive German 2-year yield for the first time since 2014, and 2-10s and 5-30s yield curves inversions in the U.S. Treasury market. Facing higher energy prices given the war in Ukraine, inflation figures remained elevated and surprised to the upside in many areas. Central bank policy was once again the dominating theme. Central bankers indicated to markets that despite everything going on in the world, from war to a resurgence in Covid cases, they are serious about tackling the inflationary pressure that still looms large and are willing to take the drastic measures necessary.1 OUTLOOK We still believe that inflation will continue to surprise to the upside. The war lingers on threatening energy prices and supply chain disruptions remain, and potentially are worsening, with lockdowns in China given Covid resurgence. Central banks are relatively limited on actions to combat inflation directly at the current moment. We expect central banks to continue normalizing policy; however, they may be forced to take a more cautious approach than they are now projecting if the war in Ukraine intensifies or if the market starts to price in expectations for a recession. We still have limited conviction on the direction of currencies. Emerging Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW Emerging markets debt (EMD) indices sold off notably across the board during the month as markets sought to digest the Russian invasion of Ukraine, further stress in the China property market, and the pricing in of an increasingly hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed). Inflationary pressures remain elevated in most EM countries with the commodity-price channel effects of the Russia/Ukraine conflict. EM central banks have continued reacting with orthodox monetary policy. U.S. dollar-denominated corporate debt,2 local sovereign debt, 3 and U.S. dollar- denominated sovereign debt also seeing negative returns.4 OUTLOOK We are optimistic on EMD as valuations appear to be well-compensating investors for the risk. The Russia/Ukraine war will continue to drive headlines and may continue for quite some time. Fundamentals are mixed and while Fed tightening is a concern, markets appear to be pricing that in somewhat aggressively. The growth and inflation dynamic remains critical. Country level analysis will be vital to uncover value as we expect markets to place an emphasis on differentiation amongst countries and credits. Corporate Credit MONTHLY REVIEW Credit spreads tightened in March with general market volatility calming after a rocky February. Over the month, markets reduced expectations that the impact would be systemic for markets outside the impacted region. Sector/corporate news in the month was limited to idiosyncratic news and speculation over the impact of increased cost inflation in the supply chain.5 The high yield market remained weak in the first half of March but strengthened in the final two weeks. Over the month, yields rose and spreads tightened and there was a brief period of inflows into the asset class, the latter of which has been exceedingly rare in the current environment.6 Global convertibles balanced between negative sentiment in the bond market from rising rates and improved sentiment in the equity on hopes that the Russia-Ukraine conflict may de-escalate. New issuance over the quarter was the second weakest first quarter on record, below only the first quarter of 2009, largely due to a weakening equity market.7 OUTLOOK Looking forward we see spreads likely to be rangebound. Markets are supported by technical demand, valuations look attractive relative to recent levels and expectations that the Russia/ Ukraine war is not systemic outside the region, leading to global default rates staying low. This is balanced by the expectation of supply and tighter financial conditions that are driving the yield curve flatter, potentially signalling an economic slowdown. Floating-Rate Loans The floating-rate corporate loan market experienced a smoother path than most of its index counterparts across the fixed income landscape. Technical conditions in the loan market were relatively balanced for the month. Fundamentals continued to showcase the health of corporate credit markets through the month.8 OUTLOOK We maintain our expectations for a strong year in loans as rising interest rates historically have been bullish for the asset class. Additionally, we remain in an appealing credit environment. As with all crises, it will take time for uncertainty to abate. In the meantime, this asset class has showcased its durability yet again. Securitized Products MONTHLY REVIEW Agency MBS underperformed again in March. Spreads are now materially wider than pre-pandemic levels as the market is anticipating the end of quantitative easing and likely the beginning of quantitative tightening, but agency MBS spreads could widen further as the Fed continues to reduce its purchases. U.S. Non-agency RMBS spreads were significantly wider across all residential sectors in March as nearly all risk assets cheapened given concerns about inflation, central bank policies and geo-political events. U.S. ABS spreads were also wider in March, but fundamental performance remains strong.9 OUTLOOK We believe the securitized market still offers a unique combination of low duration, attractive yield, and solid credit fundamentals. We remain constructive on securitized credit and cautious on agency MBS and interest rate risk. × The views and opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Management team as of March 2022 and are subject to change based on market, economic and other conditions.

There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. × Global Fixed Income Team Our fixed income investment capabilities are driven by eight specialized teams – Agency MBS, Emerging Markets, Floating-Rate Loans, High Yield, Investment Grade Credit, Municipals, Multi-Sector, and Securitized – which span the global fixed income capital markets.

"As the world gears up to tackle global warming, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydro power are at the forefront of solutions offered to avert a climate catastrophe. Yet half a century after the environmental case for nuclear power first became clear, it is making a comeback, as a way to fight climate change. × Given the challenges in quickly scaling renewable energy sources like solar, not to mention the increased geopolitical concerns around energy independence, it appears policy makers are finally waking up to the promise of nuclear power. French president Emmanuel Macron recently announced a €1 billion package of funding in support of small nuclear reactors, in addition to a pledge to construct 14 new generation reactors.1, 2 Newly elected South Korean President Yoon Sukyeol is aiming for nuclear to account for 30% of total power generation, a reversal in policy from the previous president.3 Japan, home to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, recently restarted nuclear capacity.4 China intends to build more nuclear reactors over the next 15 years—150 in total—than the rest of the world combined has built over the last 35 years.5 × DISPLAY 1: Nuclear Lifecycle GHG Emissions Lower Than Wind or Solar  Source: UN Economic Commission for Europe, 2021, “Life Cycle Assessment of Electricity Generation Options”. × DISPLAY 1: Nuclear Lifecycle GHG Emissions Lower Than Wind or Solar Source: UN Economic Commission for Europe, 2021, “Life Cycle Assessment of Electricity Generation Options”. Nuclear finally had a “seat at the table” during the recent UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow6 and, perhaps most importantly, the European Commission recently ruled that nuclear energy may potentially be included in the EU Taxonomy as a “green” sustainable activity, which may increase project financing for nuclear power.7 Public perceptions are changing as well: in 2018, only 37% of Democrats in the U.S. supported nuclear power; now a full 60% do.8 Who would have predicted a few years ago that Germany’s decision to close down the last of its nuclear power plants would prompt the Washington Post editorial board to proclaim “What a mistake,” earlier this year?9 This says nothing of the more recent sharp U-turn in attitudes towards nuclear by many European governments as they revisit their reliance on Russian fossil fuels: Britain reversed plans to shut down its nuclear plants by 2030, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced an aim to increase the nuclear share of electricity from 15% to 25%.10 Belgium, which confirmed plans as recently as December of 2021 to close all nuclear reactors by 2025, similarly reversed course and decided to extend the life of its nuclear reactors an additional ten years.11 Below we discuss the benefits of nuclear power, including why we believe public fears are misguided, and how investors can gain exposure to this structural theme. As Lux Capital’s Josh Wolfe has suggested, perhaps a re-branding of this “elemental” power is needed to overcome legacy perceptions.12 It is time facts—not fear—drive our policy towards fighting climate change. Nuclear is carbon free, more reliable than other renewables, and possesses a strong safety track record, on par with solar and wind energy. Nuclear Is Net Zero Like wind and solar, nuclear energy produces zero direct carbon or GHG emissions. In fact, nuclear has lower GHG emissions than solar and wind when we include not just direct but indirect—or Scope 3—emissions over its lifecycle (Display 1). Over the past 50 years, nuclear power has reduced CO2 emissions by more than 60 gigatons, which is almost two years’ worth of global emissions.13 Unlike solar and wind, nuclear has a proven track-record for historic decarbonization: three of the five fastest declines in the carbon intensity of energy occurred in countries that embraced nuclear power (Display 2).14 × DISPLAY 2: Nuclear Can Drastically Alter Carbon Footprint  Source: The Breakthrough Institute (December 17, 2018).

Retrieved from https://thebreakthrough. org/issues/energy/the-green-new-deal-and-the-legacy-of-public-power. Nuclear Is Reliable Our energy system requires redundancy and reliability that is hard to achieve with renewables alone. Although solar, wind and hydro have a carbon footprint similar to that of nuclear, they are much less reliable, given their dependence on weather conditions and seasonal cycles that limit consistent use. While battery technology is improving, wind and solar are not reliable “baseload” energy sources. Nuclear power is currently the only carbon-free energy source that can reliably deliver electricity, day or night, to service providers like hospitals or data centers 24/7, as illustrated by a higher capacity factor (92%) than any other energy sources including solar (25%), wind (35%) and natural gas (57%).15 Nuclear plants also have a relatively small land footprint. For example, plants in Germany require 500x less land than solar and 415x less land than wind,16 a factor which has recently caused “Germans to fall out of love with wind power,”17, 18 given land constraints and NIMBY opposition. Nuclear Is Safe Despite being carbon free, with a proven track record for historic decarbonization, nuclear power’s share of the global primary energy mix remains unchanged since the early 1980s at a little over 4%.19 Why has the world been slow to adopt nuclear? Arguably the biggest misconception about nuclear power is safety. High-profile accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima have amplified long-standing fears around nuclear. Yet any serious analysis of energy safety would compare death rates per unit of energy produced across all sources of energy, including deaths brought on by accidents and pollution. Under this methodology, nuclear is one of the safest sources of energy in the world (0.07 deaths/TWH), on par with solar (0.02) and wind (0.04), and multiple magnitudes lower than coal (24.6), oil (18.4), or natural gas (2.8) (Display 3), according to research compiled by Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser of “Our World in Data.” Deaths resulting from nuclear energy are 99% lower than deaths from coal and 97% lower than deaths from gas.20 To provide context, deaths linked to the worst nuclear accident in history (Chernobyl) resulted in an estimated 4,000 premature deaths related to radiation exposure, according to the U.N.21 While this is an unthinkable tragedy, researchers have estimated that as many as 4.5 million people died in a single year (2019) from exposure to air pollution caused by fossil fuels.22 × DISPLAY 3: Nuclear Safety Record on Par With Other Renewables  Source: Markandya &amp; Wilkinson (2007): Sovacool et al.

(2016). https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ death-rates-from-energy-production-per-twh What then explains the general public’s fear of nuclear power? It would appear to us that it stems from a societal-wide case of “salience bias,” or the tendency to overweight prominent or emotionally striking events, while underweighting less remarkable but possibly more serious events.23 Deaths resulting from coal and other fossil fuels are much greater and sadly chronic, yet many would be hard-pressed to name the last coal-related death. Nuclear accidents, on the other hand, seem to be seared into the public consciousness, as Margaret Harding, a nuclear engineer at General Electric for 27 years, notes: “You say, ‘Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima’ and everybody instantly knows what they are.”24 While there are clear safety risks with nuclear energy, tradeoffs matter. The fear of low-probability accidents, which resulted in relatively few deaths compared to other energy sources, should not stop us from advancing and improving nuclear energy in order to tackle climate change. In nearly every case that a country has shut down nuclear power plants, carbon-free electricity has been replaced with “dirty” power.25 For example, after Germany made the decision to shut down all of their nuclear power plants post- Fukushima, the country has witnessed the biggest rise in emissions since 1990, as the use of coal surpasses wind power to meet high electricity demand.26 As a result, Germany has now missed emissions targets for two straight years and has indicated it will likely fall short in the coming two years as well.27 Nuclear waste is a serious concern, but 90% of nuclear waste is low-level and only 1% radioactive.28 Three percent of the waste is considered “high-level,” but contrary to popular belief, it is dense and relatively small: by some estimates, the nuclear fuel waste generated in the U.S. over the past 60 years would “fit on a football field, stacked 20 feet high.”29 It is estimated that an American’s entire lifetime of electricity generated by nuclear power would produce long-term waste that fits in a soda can.30 Overcoming Costs Beyond public perception, another key hurdle faced by nuclear energy is cost, as illustrated by the total levelized cost of electricity per MWh.31, 32 But perhaps a carbon-free and safe form of energy that can operate at a greater capacity should be more expensive. Many experts have pointed out that the high cost of nuclear power plants are arguably a function of decades of stagnation and bad policies. To give one example, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission was created in 1975, yet as Stripe CEO Patrick Collison noted recently, since then, no new nuclear plants have ever reached operation.33 With regulatory red tape slowing the licensing process, it should be no surprise that costs have risen. Furthermore, incentives matter: the subsidies and tax breaks received by the different carbon- free sources of energy—wind, solar, nuclear—show a stark inequality. For example, in 2018 nuclear received a mere $13mn in federal tax incentives per unit of energy produced, while wind received over $2bn and solar over $3.3bn or 250x that of nuclear.34 Further, a wave of innovation in nuclear technologies is taking place all over the world, as entrepreneurs are seeking to solve a plethora of challenges, from using nuclear fission and nuclear fusion to generate electricity, to designing small modular reactors (SMRs).35, 36 Not only are SMRs designed to be significantly safer, but they will be much cheaper than current nuclear plants due to a smaller, simplified structure—SMRs can fit in a 20-foot container yet power 200,000 homes at once37—which allows them to be mass fabricated and assembled in factories, further driving down costs.38 × DISPLAY 4: EM Leads New Nuclear Capacity Additions  Source: “World Nuclear Performance Report 2021”. × DISPLAY 4: EM Leads New Nuclear Capacity Additions Source: “World Nuclear Performance Report 2021”. Emerging Markets Are Leading the Nuclear Build-Out Despite nuclear power being a reliable, safe, carbon-free source of energy, the biggest hurdle is political. For all the countries that are increasingly embracing nuclear power, Germany is targeting to phase out nuclear energy by 2022. Spain plans to phase out seven nuclear power reactors by 2035. The U.S. retired five reactors during 2021 and the Diablo Canyon Power Plant, the last in California, is poised to shut down in 2025. In fact, nuclear power output in advanced economies was down 6% from 2019 levels at the end of last year.39 In contrast, several emerging markets countries—including China, South Korea and India—which are earlier in their build-out of energy infrastructure, have demonstrated a much greater willingness to embrace nuclear energy (Display 4). Nuclear power output grew by 5% in 2021 and ended the year at 8% above 2019 levels.40 China has emerged as the world’s new champion for nuclear energy. President Xi Jinping considers nuclear as a key part of the “Made in China 2025” strategy, which is designed to bolster high-tech industries. China also announced the construction of the world’s first commercial small modular reactor in South China’s Hainan Province. After completion, the reactor will have an annual power generation capacity of 1 billion kilowatt hours, meeting the energy demands of 526,000 homes.41 Our Outlook and Investing in a Nuclear Future Given the challenges of achieving “net zero” through our current global energy mix, we expect nuclear to become a more favored alternative and play a key role in coordinated global energy transition. As investors in emerging and frontier markets, we believe nuclear power can play a role in helping developing countries achieve energy security without the need to rely on fossil fuels. In order to gain exposure to this theme, we invested in the world’s largest, lowest-cost, and cleanest nuclear fuel (uranium) mining company over three years ago (see the following case study). There are an increasing number of listed vehicles for investors to gain exposure to nuclear power, be it large-cap nuclear fuel mining companies, or a number of listed uranium ETFs. Several hurdles remain including safety, cost and public support. But just as COVID led to seismic changes in how we work, perhaps climate concerns and geopolitical events will revive support for nuclear power: a safe, reliable and carbon- free source of energy. Case Study: ESG Opportunities in the Nuclear Fuel Cycle The Next Gen Emerging Markets fund explores overlooked markets to seek out high quality business models. We avoid businesses that fail to integrate ESG considerations into their strategic planning or risk mitigation. We see actively engaging management teams on ESG risks as a vital step in our investment process. Given our long-held view that nuclear energy will need to play a larger role in efforts to fight climate change, in 2019 we became shareholders of a Kazakhstan-based company, which is the world’s leading producer and supplier of natural uranium, the main fuel source for nuclear power plants. As with most mining operations, conventional uranium mining can have harmful impacts on the environment and society writ large. This company utilizes a mining process referred to as “in-situ recovery” (ISR), which allows mining to occur with minimal amounts of physical excavation (as opposed to typical open pit mining) due to a closed-system water pumping and recycling method (Display 5). ISR is widely considered to be the safest and cleanest method of extraction given it is a closed system which requires no workers to go underground, nor blasting of rock or open cast digging. In October 2021, we engaged with the company’s CFO and head of environmental safety on a number of material issues, including: emissions, energy consumption, water management, waste management, lifecycle management, worker safety, employee diversity, and board compensation as it relates to ESG metrics. While the company is still working to strengthen its ESG reporting, it already has many sustainability considerations embedded into its business model. The two-way dialog led to a number of follow-up items and we plan to continue our active engagements with the company in the coming quarters and years in order to track and measure their progress on key issues. We believe the company is well-positioned to benefit from the global efforts to transition to a lower carbon future. This example is provided for illustrative purposes only. There is no assurance that the engagements will be successful and/or result in positive investment outcomes. × DISPLAY 5: In Situ Recovery (ISR) Mining Process  Source: Department for Energy and Mining, the Government of South Australia, In situ recovery (ISR) mining.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Stocks of small-and medium- capitalization companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets, and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more-established companies. By investing in investment company securities, the portfolio is subject to the underlying risks of that investment company’s portfolio securities. In addition to the Portfolio’s fees and expenses, the Portfolio generally would bear its share of the investment company’s fees and expenses. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). ESG Strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. 1 Alderman, L. (2022, February 10). France announces major nuclear power buildup.

"The global economic environment remains highly uncertain. On top of the unknown path and outcome of the war in Ukraine, many parts of the world are faced with record levels of inflation, rising interest rates and ongoing COVID challenges, most notably in China where the recent lockdowns affect supply chain costs and create delays. As a result, economic growth expectations have been lowered, most notably in Europe and China. Capital markets volatility across all asset classes has been extreme and is expected to continue. Given a moderated growth outlook and higher interest rates, real estate returns could potentially be lower over the next few years but still outperform other asset classes. Investor capital flows should remain steady, attracted to the durable, inflation-hedging income characteristics, which in turn should continue to support strong pricing for a narrower definition of core real estate. Class A residential and industrial markets will likely continue to outperform, while the office and retail sectors’ performance will likely remain challenged and highly bifurcated. Above Trend but Slower Growth GDP forecasts have come down due to lower demand as a result of higher prices, weaker market sentiment and squeezed consumer incomes. Despite this, real growth rate projections over the next two years still compare relatively favorably against the last 10 years (3.1% in the U.S., 2.7% in Europe and above 5% in Asia). Europe’s growth is likely to be more impacted by the war in Ukraine compared with the U.S. and Asia given its weaker macroeconomic conditions, greater dependency on Russia for energy, more supply chain linkages in key industries (e.g., autos) and greater trade exposure. Asia’s growth is likely to be less impacted as most countries are in the early-to-mid cycle phase of their economic expansion (due to stricter COVID policies), have less dependence on Russian oil, lower inflation and higher current account surpluses (compared with past crises). However, COVID-lockdowns have the potential to lower growth in China (and for the region) and further disrupt global supply chains. Growth in the U.S. should remain above-trend, helped by a healthy labor market (dynamic job market, rising participation rates and wage increases), de-levered consumer balance sheets and a strong capex cycle. Elevated and Sticky Inflation Rising energy and food prices, exacerbated by the war, has added more pressure on already high inflation prints in many countries, most notably in the U.S. (6.8%), Europe (6.8%) and the U.K. (6.7%). Governments in Europe and Asia are planning to reduce the burden from energy prices on consumers via tax reductions, subsidies and targeted income support measures. While higher energy and food prices will continue to affect all regions, MSREI believes that U.S. inflation may be more persistent relative to the other regions given higher wages and housing costs. From a real estate investing standpoint, it will be even more important to focus on sectors and opportunities where rents can grow faster than costs and where market fundamentals are more resilient to a pullback in consumer spending. Sectors best positioned to outperform in this environment include those with the strongest secular tailwinds, notably industrial and residential. Steeper Interest Rate Increases and Accelerated Unwinding of QE While Central Banks have noted the downside risks to economic growth stemming from the war in Ukraine, they have placed a higher priority on addressing inflation and therefore have adopted a more hawkish stance on monetary policy. Facing an unprecedented macro environment that includes supply chain issues, economic sanctions, war and unparalleled inflation, the Fed is expected to reduce the size of its balance sheet by $1.1T per year and aggressively raise interest rates. Morgan Stanley Research is anticipating a 50bps hike in May and in June, with additional 25bps hikes at all subsequent meetings through mid-2023, with the hiking cycle ending at 3.125%. × Display 1 GDP Forecasts have Weakened  Source: Morgan Stanley Research, data as of April 9, 2022 × Display 1 GDP Forecasts have Weakened Source: Morgan Stanley Research, data as of April 9, 2022 Display 2 CPI Forecasts have Increased  Source: Morgan Stanley Research, data as of April 9, 2022 × Display 2 CPI Forecasts have Increased Source: Morgan Stanley Research, data as of April 9, 2022 Display 3 Cap Rate Spreads Trending Below Historical Averages  Source: NCREIF, PMA, MSCI, Bloomberg, MSREI Strategy, data as of March 2022 × Display 3 Cap Rate Spreads Trending Below Historical Averages Source: NCREIF, PMA, MSCI, Bloomberg, MSREI Strategy, data as of March 2022 Outside the U.S., the Bank of England started to hike rates last year and is expected to continue in the first half of 2022, but may then decide to pause as pinched consumer incomes start to impact economic growth in the second half of the year. In Europe, markets are expecting more than two rate increases in 2022 and accelerated winding down of the ECB’s asset purchases this year. In Asia, the Reserve Bank of Australia has shifted to a more hawkish tone, with Morgan Stanley Research now expecting rate hikes totaling 250bps through the end of 2023. South Korea is also expected to raise its rates by 160bps through year-end 2023. Overall higher policy rates have already begun to flow through to higher real estate borrowing costs in certain markets, including the U.S., U.K., Australia and South Korea. Given the expected magnitude of interest rate increases, MSREI believes that the weight of capital targeting real estate may not be enough to offset an increase in cap rates resulting from higher borrowing costs and significantly compressed yield spreads. As a result, investors will need to search for opportunities to drive higher income growth in order to offset higher cap rates and keep values from declining. Shifting Longer-Term Secular Trends as a Result of the War The war’s longer-term de-globalization impacts on trading relationships, on-shoring/near-shoring trends, overall input costs and supply chains, may result in prolonged higher inflation and interest rates in some parts of the world, shifting trade routes and may create a new set of market winners and losers. A potentially stronger and more integrated Europe driven by fiscal stimulus to build out energy and defense infrastructure may lead to an above-trend, medium-term growth outlook. In the meantime, heightened political tensions and a potentially more fractured relationship between the U.S. and China may lead to decoupling in some spheres (e.g., technology), potentially causing a decrease in trade and a greater focus on maintaining buffer supplies of critical inventories in both regions. A shift to bi-polar and multi-polar economic and political relationships may create demand for more localized technology, research and development, spurring jobs in markets with access to that talent, while shifting trade patterns and re-shoring/near-shoring trends may benefit some industrial markets at the expense of others. × Display 4 Despite Prevailing Uncertainties, Near and Long-Term Macro Implications are Beginning to Emerge  × Display 4 Despite Prevailing Uncertainties, Near and Long-Term Macro Implications are Beginning to Emerge Flight to Quality More Pronounced Given the mix of macroeconomic unknowns discussed above and heightened market volatility, MSREI believes investors will need to follow a more cautious investing approach and adopt a more restricted definition of core real estate from a country, sector and location perspective. This could lead to lower return expectations for buyers of “true core” investments and the potential for transaction volumes to fall from last year’s highs due to a widening gap between seller and purchaser expectations. Additionally, higher real estate financing and hedging costs may result in a smaller and narrower buyer universe. Property Sector Fundamentals and Investment Strategy Despite the shifting market environment, MSREI believes that continuing to focus on opportunities in the higher growth industrial and residential sectors, while staying cautious on the retail and office sectors, will continue to deliver strong performance. However, within those high growth segments, investment strategies and market selection need to be more nuanced given the secular shifts across the macro landscape. Specifically, MSREI believes investors should target locations that are more resilient to a pullback in occupier and investor demand and that benefit from demographic and supply chain shifts as this may support enough rent growth to offset rising costs and potentially higher cap rates. Industrial – Diverse Set of Demand Drivers, Fewer Affordability Constraints. Development Strategy Most Attractive Industrial markets around the world continue to exhibit extremely low levels of vacancy generating record rent growth in most global locations. Despite the big uptick in rents, other supply chain costs have increased by an even greater amount (e.g., spot ocean container freight costs up 200% yoy), as a result rents still remain a relatively small fraction of the overall supply chain (5-10%), suggesting some further upside, particularly in markets in Asia and Europe which have not seen as much rent growth. Additionally, third-party logistics, retailer and wholesaler margins are yet to be materially impacted by rising costs, suggesting rent affordability remains manageable. Squeezed consumer incomes, however, may challenge the pass through of these higher costs which, combined with higher supply, may lead to slower rent growth over the next couple of years, particularly in secondary markets with fewer barriers to new construction. As mentioned above, potential supply chain shifts from de-globalization may alter relative market attractiveness. Within the U.S., re-shoring of semi-conductor and chip production may benefit fabrication locations such as Phoenix, Austin and Columbus, near-shoring manufacturing to Mexico should benefit border markets like San Diego and El Paso, while a focus on just-in-case supplies of crucial inventories could benefit markets like Atlanta and Dallas among others. × Display 5 Disciplined Execution of Current Investment Strategies  × Display 5 Disciplined Execution of Current Investment Strategies Residential – Surge in Fundamentals should Moderate as Demand/Supply Rebalance The residential rental sector has historically offered the greatest inflation protection, with a short-term lease structure that enables regular rent resets and growth tied to wages which typically tracks inflation. Additionally, rising mortgage rates should support continued strong residential rental demand, specifically in segments that target renters by choice. With higher energy and food prices threatening affordability, MSREI believes it will be critical to target markets that continue to benefit from demographic shifts and have the strongest income growth potential to keep affordability ratios at reasonable levels. Similar to the industrial sector, where shifting preferences to on-line shopping as a result of COVID have fueled demand, residential preferences in the U.S. have shifted with suburban, sunbelt and larger accommodations seeing stronger occupancy levels. However, over the past 12 months, there has been some reversion back towards urban or higher-density suburban areas, as well as gateway markets, following the return-to-office shift. Supply is also a risk in the residential sector, more so in exurban locations, but again, due to rapidly rising construction costs and supply chain delays, existing projects may be insulated against this risk for longer. × Display 6 Historically Tight Industrial Vacancy has Translated into Record Rent Growth  Source: CoStar, PMA, MSREI Strategy, data as of February 2022 × Display 6 Historically Tight Industrial Vacancy has Translated into Record Rent Growth Source: CoStar, PMA, MSREI Strategy, data as of February 2022 Office – Significant Bifurcation in Performance Significant uncertainty remains over future occupier working models, although Europe and Asia are further along in the return-to-office timeline compared to the U.S. Broadly, MSREI expects to see lower demand in the future compared to pre-COVID levels and a greater focus by occupiers and investors on quality, amenities, ESG compliance and micro location. These preferences are reflected in current absorption, rent and pricing trends. Retail Similar to the office sector, the retail market has become more bifurcated, with convenience and experiential formats continuing to outperform older, less relevant assets in less-trafficked locations. Retail exhibits the highest yield of the main property sectors, and has begun to attract investor interest resulting in cap rates stabilizing or even compressing for the best quality centers and locations. Potentially more exposed to high inflation and an economic slowdown induced by the impact of squeezed consumer incomes on discretionary spending, MSREI believes it will be important to remain very selective when deploying capital in this sector. × Display 7 Target Residential Opportunities in High Growth Markets  Source: OECD, MSREI Strategy, data as of February 2022 × Display 7 Target Residential Opportunities in High Growth Markets Source: OECD, MSREI Strategy, data as of February 2022 Display 8 Regional Differences in Work-From-Home  Source: Kastle Return-to-Work Office Barometer, Google Mobility Trends, PCA, MSREI Strategy, as of March 2022 × Display 8 Regional Differences in Work-From-Home Source: Kastle Return-to-Work Office Barometer, Google Mobility Trends, PCA, MSREI Strategy, as of March 2022 Alternative Sectors Investors are increasing allocations to alternative asset types, particularly healthcare and sectors linked to industrial and residential. Life science fundamentals remain extremely strong with vacancy rates near zero in prominent clusters, attracting capital and keeping yields at record-low levels. However, new development and office-to-lab conversions are increasing supply levels. Senior living fundamentals are accelerating, supported by aging baby boomers. Supply levels are lower compared with pre-COVID levels and yields are relatively higher than other healthcare sectors, partially due to higher operating risk. Student housing offers an attractive yield spread to multifamily, thanks to stable and countercyclical demand and reduced supply levels. Self-storage fundamentals have also been very strong due to increased housing demand and above average business demand. Lastly, leisure hotels that don’t depend on international, business-transient or group travel continue to recover strongly, with RevPAR ahead of pre-COVID levels in U.S. markets. However, the durability of that strong performance may be challenged given headwinds to consumer spending and a transition back to a more normalized share of international outbound travel as COVID restrictions are lifted abroad. Outside the U.S., the recovery in hotel performance has lagged due to COVID-related lockdowns and travel restrictions. × Display 9 Less Capital = Wider Retail Cap Rate Spreads  Source: Green Street Advisors, PMA, MSREI Strategy, data as of March 2022 × Display 9 Less Capital = Wider Retail Cap Rate Spreads Source: Green Street Advisors, PMA, MSREI Strategy, data as of March 2022 Display 10 Alternatives Sector* Investment Share  *Includes self-storage, student housing, senior living, data centers Source: Real Capital Analytics, MSREI Strategy, data as of March 2022 × Display 10 Alternatives Sector* Investment Share *Includes self-storage, student housing, senior living, data centers Source: Real Capital Analytics, MSREI Strategy, data as of March 2022 Conclusion MSREI believes that the shifting and more volatile macro environment will support attractive investment opportunities for discerning investors.

"In just a few months, Covid-19 has transformed the way we live, from the everyday washing of our hands to the way we travel, shop and eat. But well before the start of the pandemic, consumer behavior was already evolving, sparked by technological developments. The Emerging Markets Leaders strategy team has been closely following and researching the outsourcing of Digital IT Services (DITS) as an industry that would benefit from the rising digitalization trend that we are witnessing across the globe (Display 1) A great proxy for this theme has been the rise of the Digital Transformation, or DX market, which has quickly grown to become a large part of global IT spending (Display 2). × Display 1 Changes in Corporate Strategy in Response to COVID-19  Source: McKinsey, Jeffries Research August 2021. × Display 1 Changes in Corporate Strategy in Response to COVID-19 Source: McKinsey, Jeffries Research August 2021. Display 2 Digital Transformation Spending on Technologies and Services Worldwide ($B)  *E= estimate.

Forecasts/estimates are based on current market conditions, subject to change, and may not necessarily come to pass. Source: Gartner, Jeffries Research August 2021. The total DITS addressable market (TAM) estimates have ranged between US$500bn to upwards of US$1tn in 2021, compared to more than US$4tn global IT TAM (which includes hardware, software, services, communication) and US$1tn of dedicated global IT Services.1 According to Gartner, IT spending is expected to increase by low- to mid-single digits while DX spending is estimated to grow between 15-19% on the basis of Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). With segments such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR), and virtual/remote workspaces growing more than 30% CAGR,2 we believe this will remain a structural thematic on investor’s radar. We have in fact added this theme to our portfolio after following DITS for some time. But why now, some may ask? The Covid-19 outbreak accelerated the corporate demand to digitalize. The impact of this pick up has been a significant increase in the organic demand environment, to the point where we believe the longer-term demand will likely be driven substantially higher from new digital native solutions. The expected revenue growth from this theme should drive strong profitability; note that this structural theme is complimentary to the hardware/semiconductor industry. The following is a simple “real life” example in the new digital world. Consider an airline that wishes to: Create a seamless reservation system independent of outside travel agencies; Integrate Covid-19 vaccination certificates online within its app; Offer automated check-in procedures in coordination with airports via face recognition, issue and verify boarding passes baggage tagging; Offer auto-routing of misplaced baggage efficiently, optimizing costs and time. This simple example is actually a complex issue without an easy solution. Number 1 is a must-have requirement, while number 2 starts to differentiate the company. Numbers 3 and 4 then creates a significant point of differentiation from competitors. This is where the DITS firms become an important part of the solution. In our opinion, the pure digital native companies are better positioned to build these types of solutions as they are not encumbered by any legacy businesses. Greater complexity requires an engineering team capable of dealing with that complexity, including a need to develop strong upskilling programs, maintain best-of-breed talent attraction and retention capabilities, all complemented by an attractive corporate culture. In our view it is critical to find the right companies that can hire and nurture strong talent pools, maintain high retention rates, sustain high utilization rates of 75%- 80% (i.e. maintain spare capacity), aim for high organic growth rates, and establish high-teens to low-20s operating margins. Geographical cost arbitrage is also a factor in the equation. We believe the successful company needs to get comparable or better talent at cheaper than customer location pricing. In that scenario everyone wins—customers are happy (high-quality work at lower prices), employees are happy (intellectually challenging high-quality work at better than comparable local remunerations), and the company itself makes strong profits (cost arbitrage of talent to produce high-quality offerings) in a structurally growing revenue pie. Two essential factors are the relative “brand strength” of these firms, and the geographical talent availability. With respect to branding, firms need to command good relative placement within peer sets to attract top talent. Typically, their internal work cultures, remuneration, capability, and talent fostering form this brand power. If done right, there is a significant “soft moat” that gets built on three foundational elements for successful companies. Assuming competitive remuneration within the peer set is a given, these firms are able to: Generate enough brand pull for talent to join; Provide positive employee-oriented cultures to help retention; Offer enough upskilling and opportunities for each employee to grow as a professional. In our process, these soft moats combine with some hard numbers—the bench size vis-à-vis the customer slate size, and the bench utilizations—which are additional key parameters for us to assess brand strength. Our guiding principle is that bench strength needs to be right-sized relative to the business opportunity, optimally utilized at all points, ultimately providing differentiation of opportunities across multiple skill sets for each individual employee to grow. It is interesting to note that firms delivering on all of these foundational elements are typically naturally strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) companies, with social and governance factors being the standouts. This is important to our team, and our firm. As for talent recruitment, the key players are centered in India, China, Brazil, Eastern Europe, ASEAN, and the U.S.—with the majority based in Emerging Markets. Finally, there is a pyramidal structure when it comes to the industry. On the base are several traditional IT outsourcers who are trying to develop digital capabilities (traditional Indian IT players), with the middle section occupied by more global companies. The top of the pyramid has fewer players, including some of our portfolio holdings. There is also a set of firms that offer IT consulting and strategy work alongside IT services. The work at the top end is more structural, premium and lower volume, while at the base it is more commoditized with high volumes. Business consulting may or may not be a part of the DITS offering, but if offered, tends to be premium in nature. We see a “sweet spot” in the middle-high section of the pyramid, with a premium footprint where scaling up is much faster with good margins. On this part of the pyramid, the pure plays are smaller in number—and this is where we focus exclusively. Within this construct, we believe our holdings are the best-placed players due to their premium positioning, and their stage in the companies’ development cycle, positioned in the sweet spot. We have also invested into India digital IT specialists, which in our opinion has the right DNA with a smaller relative size that enables them to scale up structurally and join the sweet spot. Our view is that these firms generally have the right kind of leadership teams, operating spaces, and moat characteristics that can potentially lead to a sustainably high Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) (20%+) with strong, repeatable revenue growth, all of which the Emerging Markets Leaders Strategy finds highly attractive. × DOWNLOAD EMERGING MARKETS LEADERS FOCUS: DIGITALIZATION .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:fit-content; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Vishal Gupta Managing Director, Portfolio Manager, Emerging Markets Leaders Strategy Emerging Markets Equity Team Arun Kapoor Vice President, Emerging Markets Leaders Analyst Steve Sun Executive Director, Emerging Markets Client Portfolio Manager",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/emerging-markets-leaders-focus-digitalization.html

"Improving the Usefulness of Financial Statements The shift from tangible to intangible investments has complicated the ability to interpret financial statements. One solution is to record intangible investments on the balance sheet and then amortize them over their useful lives. We apply this approach to two companies in different industries and the S&amp;P 500 index. This results in a huge operating profit margin expansion for the company that is intangible intensive and an insignificant change for the one that is tangible intensive. We estimate that earnings for the S&amp;P 500 would be about 12 percent higher. This analysis suggests that one should compare earnings or valuation multiples over time with great caution. × Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Counterpoint Global consists of 54 people, including 30 investors, four disruptive change researchers, two consilient researchers and two sustainability researchers.

"With more than three decades of investing in emerging markets, our team has long recognized the importance of sustainable development and ESG challenges. When identifying and evaluating stocks, our portfolio managers place a great deal of emphasis on the quality of leadership, sustainable drivers of value and pathways for growth. We also believe that socialization of ESG factors in EM will mean an added set of disclosures and transparency over time, which will be critical not just to a fuller understanding of ESG risks and opportunities but to offer an additional lens on the quality of the businesses in which we invest. As active managers, we have always believed in the importance of direct dialogue with company management, and since 2017, we have added dedicated ESG engagements to our process. Material ESG issues are incorporated into our general management meetings, but we also believe that specific engagements allow us to look beyond an ESG data point and understand at a deeper level how a company’s ESG risks and opportunities are evolving, and impacting corporate strategy, current operations and long-term financial performance. We are then able to evaluate qualitative and quantitative ESG factors in greater detail and integrate them into our investment decisions. Our portfolios consist of companies that we believe will remain proactive and resilient, and continue to generate sustainable earnings growth in the face of critical environmental and social challenges globally. Finally, as responsible managers, we actively examine and vote our proxies. Voting represents the direct participation of shareholders in the overall governance of a corporation and offers shareholders a voice on important issues, such as director independence and executive compensation. In 2021, we voted at 263 meetings and reviewed 2,823 proposals across our team’s strategies. We voted against management 8% of the time, the majority of which were on board/directors’ independence issues and executive compensation. Further, investor expectations for independence and diversity of board members and increased disclosures are growing. We believe both are part of a nascent effort to refresh stale boards in EM, an effort that can bring fresh perspectives, added expertise and more accountability. × Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:60%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Emerging Markets Equity Team × Featured Funds Active International Allocation Portfolio MSACX | Class I China Equity Portfolio MAKIX | Class I Emerging Markets Leaders Portfolio MELIX | Class I Emerging Markets Portfolio MGEMX | Class I Next Gen Emerging Markets Portfolio MFMIX | Class I Previous Next",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/emerging-markets-esg-and-sustainability-2022-report.html
"Morgan Stanley’s house view on the global economy is constructive but recognizes that investment returns from traditional asset classes may be potentially more difficult to come by than in the more recent past. Public markets have delivered remarkable performance over the past few years, but we expect that returns may be lower and volatility higher going forward. It is no surprise therefore that the interest in Alternatives and Private Markets continues to grow. Of course, Alternatives and Private Markets are not homogeneous and offer a diverse set of investment opportunities with varying return and risk profiles.1 Within the space, we see several changes brought about by shifting market dynamics, through product design and innovation, and even changes in investor priorities and conscience. In the following article, we discuss some of these dynamics which we believe may provide attractive investment opportunities and investors should be aware of. Private Equity – Changing Secondary Market Dynamics Private equity represents approximately 11% of the average portfolio allocations. Despite almost tripling in size since the mid-2000s (see Display 1), one could argue that this level of adoption still appears below the optimal exposure given the asset class’s attractive performance. Increasing duration and the associated illiquidity remain key reasons why this allocation gap persists. However, there are solutions available within the private equity industry to check, or reverse, this upward trend in duration and allay investors’ concerns about increasing their allocation to the relatively long holding periods. × Display 1 Secondaries Volume vs. PE Unrealized NAV ($B)  Source: Preqin, data as of 31 March 2022 × Display 1 Secondaries Volume vs. PE Unrealized NAV ($B) Source: Preqin, data as of 31 March 2022 In the early 2000s, the secondary market was primarily a tool for large limited partners (“LPs”), such as endowments, to obtain liquidity for their portfolios. However, we are witnessing a significant shift in the use of the secondary market and attitudes about the sector have shifted tremendously in the past decade. These markets are no longer viewed solely as vehicles for LPs to provide liquidity. Rather, they have evolved to enable complex general partner (“GP”)- led restructurings of mature funds and become an important part of the strategy for many private equity and venture capital funds.2 GPs have a significant amount of capital locked up in funds. Along with an increased volume of, and narrowing spreads in, secondary markets, longer holding periods have led to a huge growth in GP-led secondaries. These transactions now represent over 50% of the secondary market transactions (Display 2). The motivations for GP-led deals are different from traditional LP secondaries. Rather than focusing on liquidity, GPs use secondaries as an avenue to preserve the assets they want to maintain while addressing the needs of their investors. Thus, when a GP has an asset that the fund partners want to keep owning but is feeling pressure to return capital to its LPs, using a secondary with a continuation fund is an attractive option while it may provide investors with an interesting set of attractive investments. This solution may allow new investors to gain access to carefully selected high quality assets, with revised favorable terms, in deals with a shorter duration, potential for compelling IRRs and less of a j-curve (Display 3). × Display 2 Annual Transaction Volume ($B)  Source: Global Secondary Market Review, Jefferies, January 2022 × Display 2 Annual Transaction Volume ($B) Source: Global Secondary Market Review, Jefferies, January 2022 Display 3 Potentially Beneficial Solution For All Parties Involved  For illustrative purposes only.

The Appeal of Hybrid Private Investments From work/life arrangements to the energies used in our cars, demand for hybrid solutions is everywhere, including investments. Indeed, we see many investors transitioning to more hybrid structures in an effort to achieve their investment goals. Similar to the growth of customization as a way to refine investment solutions over the last two decades, we are now also seeing investment solutions adopt a more hybrid approach to their structure and/or investment universe. Investors are seeking combinations of investment features such as equity-like returns with traditional bond-like characteristics and thus looking at opportunistic alternative funds. These tend to be less constrained by traditional metrics, guidelines and mandates, investing across capital structures and into more niche investment opportunities. They may offer attractive risk/return characteristics thanks to the freedom of their mandate, potentially providing complementary risk/ return profiles to traditional portfolios, public equity diversification, stable returns and alpha/growth.3 The current environment is auspicious to these less constrained funds. They have the opportunity to identify mispriced assets across a spectrum of opportunities and determine the best investment method, presenting an attractive entry point for investors. Potentially less well understood than traditional investments though, and generally less liquid, care must be taken when evaluating an investment in hybrid funds. Partnering with a specialist is therefore key. In addition to opportunistic alternative funds, traditional asset classes such as fixed income offer new hybrid funds that have the potential to deliver enhanced yields over core fixed income (see Display 4), thanks to hybrid features such as mezzanine positions and floating interest rates offerings, as well as increased access to private credit solutions (e.g., middle-market direct lending and consumer lending). Their hybrid attributes are particularly attractive for investors who can accept some illiquidity in exchange for enhanced and differentiated yields. In addition to positive real yields, these fixed income solutions may also offer downside risk mitigation for public equity exposure, which is now less available from traditional fixed income securities. × Display 4 Public vs Private Credit Risk/Return Profile  Source: Bloomberg Barclays High Yield index, S&amp;P Leveraged Loan Index and Cliffwater Direct Lending Index.

Data as of 31 December 2021. As a consequence of the environment and these features, there appears to be significant growth particularly in private credit. On the supply side, borrowers continue to look to the private markets. Equally, borrowers value the adaptability and partnership of private lenders, often the only—or the lead—investor in deals. From a demand standpoint, the global search for yield continues. Today, it also includes a demand for assets that can hedge inflation and protect capital in untested market environments. As a result, investors are increasing their allocations to the asset class (Display 5), achieving differentiation through the types of private credit chosen and other sources such as geographic diversification. Private credit still offers relatively high spreads over public markets (Display 6), as well as covenants (lender protection), and floating rate or asset-based inflation protection. It is also likely to continue to exhibit low volatility due to its less liquid nature. × Display 5 AUM of Funds Primarily Involved in Private Debt Direct Lending Has Grown Tenfold in Past Decade  × Display 5 AUM of Funds Primarily Involved in Private Debt Direct Lending Has Grown Tenfold in Past Decade Display 6 Differing Credit Source Returns %  Source: BofA Securities, Bloomberg, Clarkson, Cliffwater, Drewry Maritime Consultants, Federal Reserve, FTSE, MSCI, NCREIF, FactSet, Wells Fargo, J.P.

As extreme weather events make global headlines and experts warn about a shifting climate, more investors are thinking about both environmental risks and how they might affect their portfolios. They are also looking for investment decisions that may contribute to environmental protection or where the investment has tangible metrics and performance indicators. Early adopter investors are also no longer oblivious to the growth opportunities created by compelling climate innovations and changing consumer preferences. As Private Markets investors engage on this topic, we see increasing opportunities to effect meaningful change through true alignment of interest. Indeed, certain progressive thinking investment firms are implementing direct linkage between their fees and the outputs their investments have on the climate or environment, a unique and important step by managers showing both confidence in their investment acumen as well as moral compass. Whilst these observations do not represent the full extent of developments across what is a dynamically changing private markets investment landscape, they do represent some shifts that we believe could provide differentiated investment opportunities.

"In the early hours of March 28, China started a two-phase lockdown of Shanghai’s 26 million inhabitants1 in a desperate bid to control the spread of Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus, in what is turning out to be the latest in a series of missteps that have stalked the world’s second-largest economy. China is currently facing its worst outbreak since the pandemic was first discovered in Wuhan in 2020. × The containment effort, which also has enveloped Shenzhen, and several other regions, as part of China’s “zero-Covid” policy, is the latest in a confluence of events --from regulatory crackdown on big tech companies, to delisting concerns over U.S. ADRs and increased geopolitical risk -- that have created a perfect storm for the Chinese markets. Beijing’s ambiguous stance on the war in Ukraine has alarmed investors just as Xi Jinping’s policies promoting “common prosperity” (Display 1) and a barrage of regulations to rein in the tech industry have hurt their share prices. Government curbs on borrowing in the property sector also helped set off a spiral of falling home sales, surging corporate bond yields and eroded confidence among investors and home buyers. Allegations of Xinjiang human rights abuses have added to the complexity of investing in China for foreign investors, and in all likelihood this might be the toughest conundrum to resolve. × Display 1 Fading Mentions of “Common Prosperity” Story Counts on Common Prosperity -Jan 2020 – March 2022  Source: Bloomberg, Jeffries. × Display 1 Fading Mentions of “Common Prosperity” Story Counts on Common Prosperity -Jan 2020 – March 2022 Source: Bloomberg, Jeffries. For investors, the Chinese markets were a roller-coaster ride. On the way up, stocks soared 87% from 2020 to record highs in early 2021, or almost doubling, before losing half their value in the following 12 months.2 The MSCI China Index is currently down 45%, recovering from a 55% plunge, from its early 2021 peaks.3 The regulatory crackdown on tech companies decimated their shares, as the listed market cap of Chinese Internet stocks collapsed almost 60% to $1.3 trillion, from a $3.04 trillion peak.4 The plummeting markets forced Beijing’s hand. Vice Premier Liu He, Xi’s top economic adviser, made a surprise policy change announcement on March 16 offering “concrete actions.” Although vague on details, Liu downplayed the delisting of Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges and suggested plans related to ADRs and overseas listings were being worked out. He offered that the pace of regulation of Internet platforms should ease (Display 2) and the government would propose “strong and effective” policies to defuse the real estate sector and to keep the capital markets running smoothly . Investors liked the “Beijing put.” The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index jumped 33%, in one day, the most ever.5 Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index surged 9.1%, the most since 2008 while China's CSI 300 Index climbed 4.3%.6 × Display 2 China Could Be Past Peak RegulationBeijing Regulatory Actions – November 2020 -March 2022  Source: Piper Sandler.

As of March 30, 2021 It is too early to say that China has witnessed its “Draghi moment.” A decade ago, the European Central Bank president Mario Draghi staved off financial calamity by promising to do “whatever it takes,” to save the euro zone from a three-year sovereign debt crisis, in which several periphery countries including Greece, Ireland and Spain had their debt downgraded to junk status. Government intervention can cut both ways. In the past, China’s handling of the economy was considered a success. This time, Beijing was forced to change course and appease international investors to head off further cratering of the economy. The government faced the risk of massive layoffs by Internet companies when employment numbers are already weak. The downward market spiral threatened to impact the real economy, necessitating a much larger stimulus later. Beijing also needed to send a signal regarding the debt-ridden property and construction sector, which could hurt the rest of the economy if not managed through orderly and controlled defaults. The final deciding factor may have been foreign investors pulling out of stocks and bonds in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. According to China Central Depository &amp; Clearing, a depository for government bonds, overseas investors’ holdings of Chinese onshore bonds fell by 67 billion yuan (US$10.5 billion) in February, the largest monthly decline since 2017.7 China’s economy is slowing, weighed down by depopulation, declining productivity, high debt and the hollowing out of manufacturing industries. The country’s average income reached middle class phase in 2015, a point when all miracle economies have slowed.8 Mounting debts and a declining labor force have weighed on the economy which got a boost from last decade’s tech revolution. Today, the digital economy generates 40% of GDP output.9 Going forward, growth will likely increasingly come from the next generation of the new, “hard tech” driven economy. In the 2010s, China’s economy grew thanks to consumer Internet service giants that offered shopping, entertainment, mobile banking and the like. We believe the next turn will be to science-based industries like semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech and high-end manufacturing. Xi is pushing for self-reliance in tech, and less dependency on the U.S. in order to localize supply chains. His drive to make China carbon neutral signals deeper investment in industries such as electronic vehicles and renewable energy. If the 2000s saw the last surge of the Old China, and the 2010s the rise of New China, the 2020s will be the decade of China 3.0—an even more deeply digitizing economy. Any stimulus will mean increasing debt in the economy, a concern given the degree of leverage in the property sector. Beijing, at this point wants to manage the situation with “talk” rather than large fiscal and monetary relief, which tended to prompt enormous enthusiasm from international investors. Therefore, expect more palliative rather than stimulative measures. While historically these may not address the core issues of slower economic growth and pressure on corporate earnings, in the current environment, it will help avoid a systemic risk induced by a sell-off in bonds and equities. In our opinion, the well-known “New China” names that dominated the market in the last decade will continue to fade. What excites us are the next generation science-based industries that will create world-class companies which will attract talent and generate well-paid jobs and steady earnings growth. The wild card is the fallout from Russia’s war in Ukraine. China must have been alarmed at how quickly the West unified to arm Ukraine, impose sanctions on Russia and isolate Vladimir Putin. The U.S. has publicly warned China that any attempt to help Russia evade the West’s sanctions would result in it being targeted with the same sorts of measures that have plunged the Russian economy into chaos. Xi has called Putin his “best friend,” and although bilateral trade last year surged 35% to $147 billion,10 it’s hard to see Beijing taking any steps that could invite Western sanctions. The economic balance of power greatly favors China rather than Russia. China consumes 15% of Russia’s exports and provides about a quarter of its imports.11 Moscow has a much smaller trade influence, accounting for only 2% of China’s exports and supplying 3% of its imports.12 Today Beijing holds about $1 trillion in U.S. dollars, about 50% more than Russia’s total foreign currency reserves.13 For now, Liu’s intervention is a reminder that the government will not allow an economic downturn this year, especially ahead of the Communist Party congress that will reward Xi with an unprecedented third term. For his part, Xi would certainly prefer to arrive at the conference with an economy that is gathering steam and back on track. He faces a tough task trying to balance relations with Russia and the West, amidst a commodity price shock, a surging Omicron wave and an ongoing property fallout that will weigh on the markets. × DOWNLOAD TALES FROM THE EMERGING WORLD .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:fit-content; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Stocks of small-capitalization companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets, and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more-established companies. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the Portfolio’s performance. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Cryptocurrency (notably, Bitcoin) operates as a decentralized, peer-to-peer financial exchange and value storage that is used like money. It is not backed by any government. Federal, state or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency may experience very high volatility. 1. Reuters 2. MSIM, Bloomberg 3. MSIM, Bloomberg.

"Nash Waterman, Head of Private Markets Secondaries at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, and Boris Secciani, journalist and Head of Research for the Italian publication Fondi&amp;Sicav, discuss the evolving landscape of GP-led secondaries, and why investors should take note. In this Q&amp;A session, the pair address the history of GP-led deals, and how a focus on high performing companies has made the strategy a compelling choice for investors. × How has the secondary deal market in private equity evolved and based on what investment needs? ""This is certainly an interesting question and I am happy to provide my view of the secondary market. To answer, we need to start from a fact: the private equity secondaries industry was born and has evolved to address a myriad of different needs of equally diverse investors.1 The first transactions that fell into the macro-category of secondaries arose to meet two different needs. On the one hand, private equity funds are known to have a well-defined duration (i.e. it has a clear fund term), typically 10 years, with investors (so-called limited partners) having specific and often non-negotiable liquidity needs. On the other hand, managers of such a product (so-called general partners) sometimes need more time to be able to adequately realise the potential value of the assets held. For these reasons, the first secondary transactions took place in the context of so-called internal buy-outs in which existing general partners and new limited partners acquired an existing portfolio in a new vehicle.” “In the early days of our secondaries program, Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s private secondaries team focused on these deals as well. However, we began to pivot to GP Led deals in the early 2010s and in 2016, moved away from traditional secondaries for what we viewed as the most compelling part of the secondary market, single asset secondaries. Why do buyers find this opportunity attractive? ""In general, buyers (and many of their LPs) see the distinguishing benefits of secondaries private equity to include faster deployment in a potentially diversified set of investments, shorter duration, potential for attractive IRRs with less of a j-curve.1 I have always believed secondaries have an important benefit that is overlooked: GPs have generally owned these companies for some period of time. These managers have generally passed the higher risk discovery stage that occurs at the beginning of a PE investment. The existing GP and the management team know the company very well at this stage. This dynamic can be hugely beneficial for the secondaries buyers. Secondaries avoid the part of the lifecycle of a private equity investment that we believe is often the riskiest. While single asset secondaries opportunities were relatively scarce in 2016, we felt the opportunity was so compelling that we shifted our secondaries program to focus on this single asset strategy, with the goal of delivering our clients a market-leading and differentiated secondaries offering.” In recent years, so-called single-asset secondaries have become very popular. Can you give a few more details about this? ""I love this question because it shows how much the sentiment has changed. As noted, in 2016, single asset secondaries were a little-known investment area and some may have questioned our strategy initially. In our view, single-asset secondaries address a fundamental natural conflict in private equity. What does a private equity manager do if they find a great business they believe has significant potential for value creation going forward but they have run out of time or resources to pursue that potential within their existing fund? Should the GP sell the asset and send back the cash to its investors? Should the GP hold onto the asset and potentially extend their fund life? Should the GP sell it to their most recent fund? Private equity investors do not see it all the same way. Some want cash. Some want to hold assets they believe have potential. Some are fine either way. Single asset secondaries provide choices for LPs, who generally can choose to sell or hold. For buyers, the case for single asset secondaries is relatively simple in my view. I believe GPs more commonly move forward with these transactions for their best companies, creating a positive selection bias from the seller. Furthermore, we can frequently conduct due diligence alongside the owner and the management team-who are STAYING with the business. This small nuance makes a material difference. Both parties are incentivized to be transparent with us because we are partners going forward. This approach has helped us achieve strong performance with the potential for returns beyond what many investors expect for a secondary fund.2 At Morgan Stanley Investment Management, our goal with our single asset secondary funds is to exceed not only typical secondary fund performance, but also the performance of the PE market in general. Our current Ashbridge II Fund seeks to deliver top quartile returns on an IRR basis, on a multiple of investment capital, and on a DPI basis. What kind of companies are you most interested in? ""In overall terms, the secondary sector is quite diversified, with groups that specialize in different industry segments requiring a different set of skills.1 In our case, we are interested in companies that provide an essential product or service to a stable end market. We live in an unpredictable economic environment. We can no longer invest with the comfortable predictability of what many call cycles. As a team, we generally do not consider cycles or cyclicality when choosing our investments. We invest with the assumption that there will be a continuous set of surprise economic shocks that will challenge certain industries, certain countries, and sometimes the global economy. For many of us, we view our careers as having been an ongoing set of economic crises with pauses in between. We seek to prepare for that reality and take advantage when investing”. There are increasing concerns about the continuation of a higher inflation rate and thus, at least in the medium term, a higher cost of money. Do you fear such developments? Do you think that the private equity industry, which is often characterised by a high degree of leverage, will face difficult times? ""We believe a minimal amount of inflation is good for the economy and the markets. It is no coincidence that over the last decade the monetary authorities have gone to great lengths to try to stimulate it. In the long run, the effects of having interest rates at or below zero are probably more negative than positive in our view. That said, excessive leverage will be a problem for many companies in a rising rate environment and is a risk that we seek to minimise within our Ashbridge II Fund. 1 Diversification does not eliminate the risk of loss. 2 Past performance is not indicative of future results. × Nash Waterman Head of AIP Private Markets Secondaries AIP Private Markets Team Reproduced with permission of:  BY BORIS SECCIANI × Reproduced with permission of: BY BORIS SECCIANI",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/the-evolution-of-gp-led-secondaries.html

"Equities rallied in the final two weeks of March, with developed market equities recouping part of their YTD losses. The S&amp;P 500 (USD) ended the month up 3.7%1, the MSCI Europe (EUR) returning 1.0%1 and the MSCI Japan (JPY) up 5.0%1, whilst the MSCI Emerging Markets (USD) fell -2.2%1. Oil prices continued to crank higher due to the Russia-Ukraine war, with the benchmark WTI at one point reaching $123bbl2, before pulling back to $100bbl1 by month end, as China’s lockdowns dampened demand. The VIX came down significantly from 36.53, finishing March at 20.61. Bonds sold off, with the US 10-year Treasury yield jumping to 2.3%1 by March end. × Is the rally a short-term reversal? This year’s sell-off appears to have been driven by sentiment, not an earnings recession. Commodity-exporting countries are showing the most value, though most equities no longer appear expensive,4 with the US the exception. Earnings are still expected to grow around 9% over the next 12 months5. However, the risk is markets take another leg lower and 2022 growth expectations get downgraded. Moreover, the major macro themes reinforce two outcomes: higher inflation and weaker growth. Both the war in Ukraine and China’s renewed lockdowns put upside pressure on inflation and downward pressure on growth, as well as exacerbating supply chain disruptions, particularly for commodities from Russia. The Fed hikes and signals aggressive tightening to come Central bank policy is also being watched closely. As US inflation accelerated to a 40-year high of 7.9%6 in February, March’s FOMC meeting brought the first rate hike since 2018. Chairman Powell signaled aggressive tightening, citing a potential 50bps hike in May. He indicated that the economy should be able to withstand the pace, as should the labour market which is “tight to an unhealthy level7” - another acknowledgement the Fed may be behind the curve. The Fed Funds futures are reflecting market and Fed alignment, with 7-8 rate hikes in 2022 and 4 in 2023. Investment Implications We maintain low equity exposure, reflecting our defensive positioning. In addition to the broad commodities for portfolios which permit, we have included further inflation hedges and initiated downside growth hedges, such as gold and have lengthened duration. US 10-Year breakeven We have added an overweight to US 10-Year breakevens, to hedge against protracted inflation in 2022 and de-anchoring of US inflation expectations. Despite already lofty valuations, the recent commodity price spike further contributes to high core inflation. We have added to US rather than European inflation, as we believe US inflation is more structural than in Europe, where only some of the main components have been impacted (food and energy). In contrast, the US is experiencing more broad-based inflation, with wage increases also reenforcing the dynamics. Energy We added to our energy overweight, which should continue to benefit from higher equilibrium energy prices. Gold For portfolios which permit, we initiated an overweight to gold, as a diversifier of geopolitical risks, particularly in the face of global growth fears. Sanctions on Russia have reinforced gold’s role as the currency of last resort. Compared to other commodities, gold is still attractively valued. Duration We moved from underweight to neutral duration. Long-end yields will likely remain capped, as the growth outlook deteriorates, due to the commodity supply shock. Central banks, led by the Fed, should continue to hike into slowing growth to keep inflation in check, leaving front-end rates to trade with an upside bias. Eurozone equities, financials and UK equities We reduced exposure to eurozone equities, given stronger links to Russia, relative to the US and rising risk of recession in Europe. We reflected this through reducing European banks, expressed in some portfolios through a removal of global financials. We added an overweight to UK equities, to gain exposure to UK banks, as well as materials, energy and consumer staples. This is not only a defensive play, but also an inflation hedge due to high commodities exposure, relative to Europe. Chinese internet We removed our position in Chinese internet stocks, due to heightened global volatility from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the potential increase in US-China tensions and renewed lockdowns in China. Although attractive in the longer-term, near term they are likely to remain under pressure from negative sentiment.

Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser’s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio’s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio’s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. × Andrew Harmstone Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Manfred Hui Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Select Product(s) Right Click Edit",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/managing-portfolios-in-an-inflationary-world.html

"February was a challenging month for financial markets, with most assets reporting negative returns. Most of the month was dominated by stronger-than-expected inflation causing central banks to turn more hawkish, causing fixed income assets, government bonds in particular, to perform poorly. However, the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which most investors did not anticipate, caused risky assets—equities, corporate credit, emerging market debt—to sell off. European assets did worse than U.S., which makes sense given Western Europe’s economic linkages to central and Eastern Europe. The rise in energy prices—both oil and natural gas—is of particular concern for the European economic outlook given it is effectively a tax on consumers. European bank debt and equity also suffered due to concerns about Eastern European exposure and the impact Western sanctions will have on the financial sector. While government bonds staged a dramatic rally in response to the invasion, they still delivered negative returns for the month. The U.S. dollar and Swiss franc rose, given their “safe-haven” status, as did commodity currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollar. The Russian ruble depreciated around 30% due to the impact of sanctions; other Russian assets also depreciated in value significantly, the extent to which is difficult to know for sure given illiquidity. Reduced liquidity in financial markets is exacerbating downward price pressures making it difficult to disentangle changes in fundamentals from temporary dislocations. × DISPLAY 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date  Note: USD-based performance.

Fixed Income Outlook Financial markets have gone from worrying about COVID-19 to worrying about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The main impact on economies, beyond the immediate region, will be through higher commodity prices, mainly energy (natural gas and oil), but also food (wheat) and metals. The main concerns for investors are: what impact will this have on economic growth, central bank policy and corporate profitability. At present our expectation is that the conflict may continue for several months, but we are hopeful that it will not escalate further or expand into a broader regional or global conflict. This means the economic impact will primarily be felt through higher commodity prices, with the market already pricing in the expected supply disruption. There is a risk that sanctions, which have cut Russia off from global financial markets, destabilize global financial conditions, but we are optimistic that central banks will be quick to respond to any signs of stress. Higher commodity prices will effectively act as a tax on household and businesses, reducing demand for other goods and services, and pushing up inflation. It will be relatively obvious for central banks to ignore commodities’ impact on inflation (which should be transitory) but more difficult for them to decide how much to tighten policy given inflationary pressures from other sources are strong but the growth outlook is now a lot more uncertain. Given economies were rebounding strongly before the conflict started, we think they will still grow at a robust rate, meaning central banks will remain committed to normalizing monetary policy, just more cautiously than before. So, expect 25 basis points (bps) rate hikes rather than 50bps jumps, getting to the same point in the end but taking a few months longer. This means we still expect government bond yields to rise from current levels, and credit products to remain under pressure (even if underlying asset quality remains sound). Uncertainty about the length and intensity of the conflict remains the biggest issue. That said, the meaningful sell off in credit products in March, particularly in investment grade bonds is already pricing in a significant deterioration in economic conditions and in the case of euro denominated credit, almost recessionary economic conditions. Central banks have their work cut out for them but for now we expect central banks will follow through on their pre-invasion monetary tightening strategies. The impact on corporate profitability is likely to be varied. The Energy, Commodities and Defense sectors are likely to benefit (not that we see a lot of this being priced in at present, especially in emerging markets); Healthcare and Telecoms will be least affected, and for Utilities it will depend on their exact regulatory and commodity exposure. Both Industrials and Consumer sectors will be negatively affected, but at least they were experiencing strong demand going into the crisis. However, there is no denying that the impact will be negative, with European corporates more affected. Still, we think the growth backdrop is strong enough that default risk remains low given the extent corporates have repaired their balance sheets over the last two years. We therefore think corporate credit remains attractive and have a preference for high yield over investment grade. The conflict has also created opportunities in emerging markets, which have repriced cheaper due to liquidity and contagion reasons; many of them ought to be beneficiaries of higher commodity prices, but this is not reflected in the recent price action. The U.S. dollar and Swiss franc have benefitted as “safe havens” and are likely to remain strong during this uncertain tumultuous period. Longer term the U.S. dollar looks stretched and may explain why it has not risen even by more than it already has. Developed Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW The month began with more signs of persistent inflation and further hawkish shifts from central banks, leading to a broad increase in rates. That narrative was interrupted as the attention shifted to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which disrupted global markets across asset classes. The initial increase in rates reversed, as a flight to safety supported government bonds and markets anticipated that central banks may move slowly when removing accommodative policies. The U.S. dollar appreciated due to its “safe-haven” status. Inflation remains a key theme, with data continuing to surprise to the upside, and the outlook exacerbated by higher commodity prices due to the Ukraine conflict.1 OUTLOOK Developed economy central banks face a more difficult job, as they now need to balance increased downside economic risk against stronger than expected inflation. Most economies are mainly affected by Ukraine through higher commodity prices, which are effectively a tax on consumers and will reduce demand for other goods. There are also concerns about what sanctions will do to global financial liquidity conditions. We still expect central banks to normalise policy. However, the pace is likely to be more cautious than previously speculated. This should mean that government bond yields still rise through 2022, as the conflict is likely to delay the pace of normalisation for three to six months rather than stop it. We have limited conviction on the direction of currencies. Emerging Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW Emerging markets debt (EMD) experienced a large increase in volatility upon Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine towards the end of the month. Broader global markets did experience a related increase in volatility, but really focused on Russian and Ukrainian assets as well as those in the immediately surrounding countries. Local Russian fixed income assets were down an estimated 70% in value. U.S. dollar-denominated corporate debt,2 local sovereign debt,3 and U.S. dollar- denominated sovereign debt were also down.4 OUTLOOK The outcome of this situation is quite fluid and path dependent, including the degree of broader geopolitical impact and contagion into global capital markets as large scale sanctions begin to take effect. Various macro implications include further global inflation as a result of supply side shocks and the West’s tolerance level for autocratic regimes. Corporate Credit MONTHLY REVIEW Investment grade corporate credit spreads widened in February with general market volatility continuing amidst macro disruptors. Government bond yields rose globally. The Russian invasion of Ukraine was the major news event in February where the sentiment is fluid reflecting each new piece of information. Other news impacting markets included upside surprises to the global inflation data. Corporate news in the month was dominated by fourth quarter reporting.5 The high yield corporate market remained weak in February. Concern over elevated inflation readings and increasingly hawkish messaging from the U.S. Federal Reserve remained a consistent theme. The Russian invasion of Ukraine injected additional volatility into the market. Over the month, yields rose by 35 bps and spreads widened.6 Global convertibles continued the worst start to a year on record as investors weighed the impact of rising rates and of war in Ukraine. Issuance was low in down markets in February. Growth sectors lagged again while only Energy and Materials rallied.7 The senior floating-rate corporate loan market lost ground in February driven by market volatility. Despite the modestly negative performance, loans fared better relative to other capital markets, including equities and high-yield corporate bonds.8 OUTLOOK Looking forward with valuations significantly above the long run average for spreads and nearing the wides of the fourth quarter 2018, we see value opportunities but expect volatility given the near-term uncertainty of geo-politics and the limited liquidity available if flows increase. Securitized Products MONTHLY REVIEW Agency MBS underperformed again in February. Spreads are now wider than pre-pandemic levels as the market anticipates the end of quantitative easing and potentially the beginning of quantitative tightening, but agency MBS spreads could widen further from supply-demand pressure. U.S. non- agency RMBS spreads were also wider across most residential sectors in February, as nearly all risk assets cheapened given concerns about inflation, central bank policies and geo-political events. U.S. ABS spreads were also wider, but fundamental performance remains strong and issuance remained high through the month.9 OUTLOOK We believe the securitized market still offers a unique combination of low duration, attractive yields, and solid credit fundamentals. We remain constructive on securitized credit and cautious on agency MBS and interest rate risk. × The views and opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Management team as of March 2022 and are subject to change based on market, economic and other conditions.

There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. × Global Fixed Income Team Our fixed income investment capabilities are driven by eight specialized teams – Agency MBS, Emerging Markets, Floating-Rate Loans, High Yield, Investment Grade Credit, Municipals, Multi-Sector, and Securitized – which span the global fixed income capital markets.

"In January 2019, Ken Michlitsch, AIP Alternative Lending Group Portfolio Manager, interviewed Upstart CEO David Girouard about the increasingly important role machine learning plays in the consumer lending process. × Background While machine learning has been embraced by diverse industries, from online shopping to autonomous cars, finance has been a relatively slow adopter. Commensurate with the rise of consumer alternative lending that has begun to change—to the benefit of consumer borrowers. Consumer alternative lending encompasses online platforms that use a marketplace model to bring together consumer borrowers and lenders. These platforms view the consumer underwriting process through a different lens than traditional consumer lenders do. While traditional lenders commonly focus on a narrow set of borrower attributes, such as income and employment status, alongside a credit score (a backward-looking risk assessment metric), alternative lending platforms may use a much broader dataset to predict a borrower’s ability and willingness to repay a loan. This alternative data might include educational background, occupation, housing costs, bank account transaction details and/ or estimated free cash flow. This fuller picture of the borrower in some circumstances can mean consumer access to credit not otherwise available at comparable rates. Indeed, on December 3, 2019, five federal financial regulatory agencies issued a joint statement on the “benefits that using alternative data may provide to consumers, such as expanding access to credit and enabling consumers to obtain additional products and more favorable pricing and terms.”1 Underpinning this model is data: access to lots of data with the ability to analyze it quickly and competently. Machine learning facilitates real-time processing of huge volumes of data about loans with the goal of ever-improving, ever-“smarter” models that make sense of it all. In short, the rise of alternative lending has been driven by the same boom in data that we’ve seen disrupt industry after industry. What prompted your decision to launch Upstart? The traditional lending model hasn’t changed in many decades. Banks continue to use the same backward-looking metrics and models that they’ve used for years, making credit available to the same types of borrowers at the same terms. That works well for some borrowers, but not all. We realized the types of technologies we were building at Google could make a positive impact on how credit is accessed by more types of borrowers. The tools we were working on could provide a more predictive model that could understand who an applicant is, his propensity to pay something back and his capacity to pay it back. In short, we saw the opportunity to dramatically improve access to credit for people. Far more people in this country are judged as “risky” than actually are. What type of borrower stands to benefit from the alternative lending model? Younger borrowers come to mind. We think of ideal candidates as “future prime” borrowers: they don't have blemished credit, but they don't have a lot of history either. They are transforming themselves from being net debtors, often because of student loans or medical bills, to being wealth creators. Machine learning helps us see the trajectory of their incomes. Can you compare and contrast alternative lending underwriting with traditional bank underwriting? Traditional models tend to be FICO-centric and rules-based. For example, a borrower must be above a certain FICO score and can't have had any bankruptcies within a certain number of years in order to qualify for a loan. The rate a bank assigns to a borrower who meets those criteria depends on the perceived credit-worthiness assigned by their model. A borrower who falls short on any of these measures is simply denied credit. Traditional lenders have come to use a larger number of variables, relying on linear regressions to inform their views on which variables matter most, but their models have remained fairly static over time. Alternative lenders analyze thousands of variables, including borrower bank account transactions, monthly repayments, prepayments, delinquencies, and their models look for patterns in the way those variables interact. Much more quickly than a human being ever could, machine learning enables models to “learn” from data as soon as it’s introduced, becoming better and better able to make predictions about likelihood of defaults. In other words, over time models can predict that if ten specific things are true, an eleventh is likely also true. For example, knowing where someone went to school, what he studied, what his tax burden is, where he works, and what his monthly bank transactions are allows a model to extrapolate other things that increase a lender’s confidence about that person’s willingness and ability to repay a loan in the future. How does machine learning impact other parts of the alternative lending process? Machine learning has a role to play at every stage of the process: this includes customer acquisition, credit scoring, loan servicing and the mechanism through which loans are repaid. With customer acquisition, the challenge is identifying the right borrowers, people who need a loan and are likely to qualify for one. Lenders target potential borrowers digitally, but somewhat surprisingly also achieve good results through direct mail campaigns. Machine learning facilitates a degree of automation in the application process as well, reducing the amount of human oversight and time required to process a loan. For example, if an applicant provides access to his bank account, a lender can immediately verify his education, income and current employer without requiring documentation for each of those three things. This means less paperwork for the applicant to gather, fewer documents for the lender to review and quicker turnaround time for both parties. Over time, this can translate into lower costs being passed through to the consumer. Loan servicing can also be done in an automated way. Alternative lenders generally use an automated clearinghouse to pull payments directly from a borrower's bank account; no bill is sent and no paperwork is filled out on a monthly basis. Do you think there are broader applications for machine learning in the lending space? In a decade we believe that most types of lending around the world will rely on machine learning as opposed to traditional models because the difference in economics is so dramatic. We have fairly reliable data that shows for a given set of borrowers in certain FICO ranges our loss rates are less than half of what we see in our industry. That is an enormous difference, and it's not random. It's a fundamentally different system, one that is transferable to small business, real estate and auto lending. × 1 https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/federal-regulators-issue-joint-statement-use-alternative-data-credit-underwriting/ × Dave was formerly President of Google Enterprise and built Google's billion-dollar cloud apps business worldwide, including product development, sales, marketing, and customer support.

"The military conflict in Ukraine means the world is witnessing a televised humanitarian crisis and grappling with forces and scenarios not contemplated in Europe since the Second World War. Our team’s thoughts are with the victims and families of all those affected. While year-to-date the MSCI World is down 8% in U.S. dollars, it remains up more than 10% in the last 12 months. This fairly limited market drop has been down to a de-rating rather than any fall in market earnings expectations. × Forward earnings estimates, perhaps optimistically, have actually risen 3% over the last two months. Historically, it has been the robustness of earnings in tough times, be they the Global Financial Crisis or COVID, that has provided our global portfolios’ relatively low participation on the downside, not something that has applied so far in 2022 given that the market’s earnings have held up so far this year. It is worth noting that the de-rating has been valuation driven, with the more expensive stocks falling more. Dividing the MSCI World into five quintiles by end 2021 multiples, the top quintile is off 15%, the second down 9%, while the other three have only fallen 1-4%. While we have been very focussed on valuation over the last few years, trimming the more expensive, growthier names as they have re-rated, on top of always avoiding the most expensive growth names, the portfolio’s high quality means that they are mildly more expensive than the market, with about half the portfolios’ weight in the second quintile. As such the market’s de-rating has been a headwind, though it has had the benefit of making some names, both inside and outside the current portfolios, more attractively valued. The final point to make is around the sector moves. Consumer staples, a key sector for our global portfolios, has held up relatively well this year, but looking at the other outperforming sectors in 2022, our philosophy means that we are not invested in energy (the standout performer this year), materials or utilities, while we are significantly underweight financials, not least because we avoid banks. We remain focused on compounding over the long run, something the market struggles to do. What we look for in a stock is simple, but hard to find. First on the list is companies with dominant and sustainable intangible assets, for instance brands or networks. These intangible assets should drive pricing power, which we define as the ability to pass on input cost inflation to the end consumer. This is particularly important in today’s inflationary environment. The signal you have pricing power is a history of a high and stable gross margin in the face of input cost shocks. We also demand the ability to steadily grow revenues organically, rather than a volatile cyclical top-line, with a substantial recurring element. Such recurring revenue can come from repeat purchase of a favoured shampoo or face cream, or from long-term relationships and contracts. The combination of pricing power (protecting margins) and recurring revenues (protecting sales) should lead to robust profits. Given the reliance on intangible rather than tangible assets, these profits should be generated at high returns on capital, and as such robust earnings should turn into robust cash flows. Sadly, compounding requires more than a strong and sustainable franchise that can be relied upon to grow steadily at high returns. It also requires the right management, who are not only going to continue to innovate and advertise to preserve and improve the intangible assets, but also allocate the remaining free cash flows well. Some companies are fine acquirors, but most are not and should therefore focus on returning the excess cash to shareholders. The final test is valuation. We are happy to own companies we believe are going to compound at fair value, relying on the compounding to deliver the returns, but paying too much for them risks the permanent destruction of capital. This process for selecting stocks has been consistent for a quarter of a century. Both this history and basic economics suggest that our global portfolios’ earnings should be relatively resilient in a squeeze on the wider market’s profitability, be it due to inflation, governments’ reaction to inflation or a geopolitical crisis. The market still looks vulnerable, especially if the current geopolitical crisis worsens, with the MSCI World Index over 17 times forward earnings, a multiple never reached between 2003 and 2019, and this on earnings estimates up 57% from June 2020 and 23% above the pre-COVID peak. In a deeply uncertain world, we would argue that limiting your uncertainty by owning a portfolio of relatively predictable compounders makes sense, particularly when they are available at a modest free cash flow premium to the market. × Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy’s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. × Bruno Paulson Managing Director International Equity Team Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I Previous Next",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/investing-in-a-deeply-uncertain-world.html

"The current geopolitical events on top of the ever present COVID-19 virus pandemic might make it seem like the world has been turned upside down. Yet, as disturbing as these events are, they are really just accelerating trends that were already well under way. Rising debt, global food and energy price hikes, territorial conflicts, increasing climate change and continuing technological barriers have only become even more pronounced with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In this paper, we convey our ten themes for the year examining the deeper trends that will likely have major economic, political and market impact. × 1. DEBT PROLIFERATION Inching higher for four decades, global debt soared during the pandemic, driven by government borrowing. Twenty five countries, including the U.S. and China, have total debt above 300 percent of GDP, up from none in the mid-1990s.1 Money printed by central banks designed to protect lives, preserve jobs and prevent bankruptcies also inflated the financial markets, which were about the same size as the global economy in 1980, and are now more than four times larger.2 This has only deepened the debt trap: societies addicted to debt find it tough to cut back, for fear of triggering a wave of bankruptcies and market contagion. Central bank mandates are generally designed to stabilize inflation and employment, but now also require that tremors in the financial economy do not negatively impact the real economy. Faced with such a dilemma, central banks need to avoid tightening too fast—a delicate balancing act that, if mishandled, could generate additional volatility and even greater stress in financial markets. 2. BUT NO DEBT IMPLOSION U.S. government debt is at the highest level ever, at 133% of GDP, although it reached a similar levels of 121% in 1946 after World War II (Display 1).3 × Display 1 Debt Spikes Coincide with Negative Real Rates  Source: MSIM Emerging Markets Research, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver. As of Feb 22, 2022 × Display 1 Debt Spikes Coincide with Negative Real Rates Source: MSIM Emerging Markets Research, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver. As of Feb 22, 2022 And yet, the debt service burden is not as large as it was historically. Over the past decade, average global interest rates were lower than average global nominal GDP growth rates.4 This has made debt sustainable across countries, a marked difference compared to the conditions before and amid the great financial crisis. The downside, however, is that higher rates will likely have a much greater impact on government and non-government balance sheets, and risk being much more damaging today than they were just over a decade ago. This could force policy makers to remain behind the curve. Government debt sustainability depends on economic growth, budget balances and the interest cost of servicing debt. The key to debt servicing cost is the real interest rate. And with higher inflation ahead, even if nominal yields rise, real yields are likely to stay negative or low. That makes it unlikely we will witness a debt implosion, which would be the worst-case scenario for financial markets. 3. INFLATION GENIE OUT OF THE BOTTLE For a long time, inflation had been tamed. Last decade, inflation in the U.S. averaged only 1.8%.5 But as the rush of government Covid relief spending and debt last year, as well as the rise in oil prices driven by the Russian invasion of Ukraine push inflation higher, many in the media fear a return to 1970s levels of double-digit inflation when it rose to 11% in 1974 and more than 13% in 1980 (Display 2).6 × Display 2 U.S. Inflation Highest Since the 1980s  Source: MSIM Emerging Markets Research, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver. As of Feb 22, 2022 × Display 2 U.S. Inflation Highest Since the 1980s Source: MSIM Emerging Markets Research, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver. As of Feb 22, 2022 The economy of the 1970s not only suffered from two oil price shocks (Arab oil embargo in 1973 and the 1979 Iranian Revolution), but the closing of the gold window and subsequent floating of the dollar, the unwinding of wage controls that had suppressed wage inflation earlier in the decade, and widespread unionization that led to higher wage demands. Since then, the U.S. economy has become progressively less energy intensive reducing the impact of an energy price shock compared to the 1970s. The decline in union membership over the recent decades also puts a dampener on intense wage pressures. But it isn’t the 2010s anymore either. The U.S. does have an inflation problem, which is likely to persist. Demographic decline means fewer workers and higher wages. Deglobalization--weakening flows of goods, money and people--reduces competition. Weak productivity growth implies higher costs. Efforts to reduce carbon emissions, is inflationary, as we note below. Sustained supply disruptions due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine will also put pressure on prices. The bigger risk however comes from asset prices. Even when the financial markets were much smaller than they are today, their corrections could depress consumers and lead to consumer price deflation, as Japan experienced in the 1990s. 4. GREENFLATION PARADOX Climate change is raising demand for the so-called “green” metals like copper and aluminum, but green politics has been reducing raw material supplies of all kinds. Investment in mines and oil fields has dropped by more than 50% in the last five to ten years (Display 3).7 Normally new technologies fuel a last gasp of defensive investment in old ones like electricity growth spurred a gas lighting boom in the early 1900s that continued for many years. × Display 3 Global oil and mining capital expenditure has dropped significantly  Source: Bernstein, Wood Mackenzie, The Economist, MSIM Emerging Markets Research. As of 2020 × Display 3 Global oil and mining capital expenditure has dropped significantly Source: Bernstein, Wood Mackenzie, The Economist, MSIM Emerging Markets Research. As of 2020 Green building projects will raise demand for “dirty metals” and fossil fuel. Green politics will cut supply, inflating the cost of building a cleaner economy. The harder policymakers try to bring forward the shift away from fossil fuels, the less oil and gas exploration will take place, and oil price will need to be higher until the transition is well advanced, and that can take many years. The curbs on Russian energy exports have seen rising oil prices and increased calls to expand domestic production. Governments are more focused on alleviating near-term price shocks but the long term trend is to cut reliance on fossil fuels. Both the demand and supply side dynamics in several commodities are supportive of a multi year boom in commodity prices. 5. AN EMERGING MARKETS COMEBACK Every decade one investment theme captures the attention of investors. The 2010s was dominated by large tech companies in the U.S. as the U.S. emerged from the Global Financial Crisis with a deleveraged economy, a cheap dollar and very attractive overall asset valuations. Emerging markets (EM) have fallen off the radar after the worst decade for emerging stock market returns since the 1930s8 —and to makes matters worse, EM equities had another disappointing year in 2021. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index declined -2.3%, underperforming the MSCI World Index by 25%, due to a number of factors including: an economic slowdown driven by policy tightening, a regulatory crackdown in China, inflation overhang, dollar strength, EM currency weakness and COVID-19 shocks.9 Several critical catalysts, however, should turn the macro environment positive for the EM asset class this decade. We expect a comeback for select EM equities over the next few years driven by a post-pandemic recovery, pandemic-inspired reform, manufacturing, ongoing strength in commodities and the digital revolution. Asset class valuations are at very attractive levels, with equities at nearly a 50% discount based on composite metrics.10 6. CHINA 3.0 China’s old economy is slowing, weighed down by depopulation, declining productivity, high debt and the hollowing out of manufacturing industries. Going forward, growth will come increasingly from the next generation of the new, “hard tech” driven economy. In the 2010s, China’s new economy was rising on consumer internet service giants that offered shopping, entertainment, mobile banking and the like. We believe the next turn will be to science based industries like semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech and high-end manufacturing. Xi is pushing for self-reliance in tech, meaning in particular less reliance on the U.S. in order to localize supply chains. His drive to make China carbon neutral signals deeper investment in sectors such as electronic vehicles and renewable energy. If the 2000s saw the last surge of the Old China, and the 2010s the rise of New China, the 2020s will be the decade of China 3.0—an even more deeply digitizing economy. 7. A SILICON CURTAIN DESCENDS For the past decade, nations have erected barriers to slow the flow of people, trade and even money. Data has been the one exception. According to Ericsson, mobile data traffic in the third quarter of 2021 alone exceeded all the mobile traffic before 2017.11 In the U.S. and Europe, it is the regulators who are trying to rein in the tech giants and even the playing fields. Other countries are filtering data, and blocking it from crossing borders, creating the “Silicon Curtain.” Data localization requirements now act as non-tariff barriers to digital services trade and could reduce the efficiency of digital data trade. Techno-nationalism is on the rise where countries are viewing private-sector technological developments through the lens of national security. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is likely to accelerate the fragmentation of the global economy—to include financial systems, beyond the traded goods system. 8. STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS We could witness a renewed capital expenditure cycle in several parts of the world to deal with global warming and geopolitical challenges. The realization that a net zero world path is not easy will lead to investments to meet the goals of energy security and expanding alternative supplies. For economic resilience, countries will focus on onshoring some productive capacity; insulating supply chains from geopolitical risk; and building inventories of important commodities and goods. The world of Just-in-time Management may be structurally changing. There is a need to increase defense spending especially in Europe and substitution of capital for labor could become necessary as faster wage growth will encourage higher labor-replacing investment. After 75 years of austerity in Germany, the tide may be turning. The pandemic saw Germany accept aggressive fiscal stimulus and debt mutualization within the EU. Recent EU bonds are a step in the direction to support these investments. 9. RETURN OF THE MATERIAL WORLD In the 2000s the world was overinvested in commodities and underinvested in technology. In the 2010s decade that trend reversed.12 Now a turn towards the commodities is underway. Despite the hype for the intangible economy, the rise in prices in the physical economy—land, cars, raw materials and human labor—tells a different story. A housing deficit has seen home prices rise 14% last year in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the highest since 1980 (Display 4).13 × Display 4 Home Prices at Their Highest Year-over-Year Increase Since 1980  Source: MSIM, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver.

Growing demand from millennials helped drive the global boom in both house and car prices in 2021. The cars of the future may be smarter than the current gasoline-burning models, but they also require a lot more copper and aluminum -- an electric car requires more than three times as much copper -- to connect their batteries and software. Physical labor shortages are translating into increased wages worldwide. Even the advances in the metaverse have fostered a land-grab as data centers become the new real estate. Behind every digital screen is an array of microchips and costs that have soared amid a global shortage, demonstrating how even the most digital tech sectors are not immune from physical world constraints. 10. ELECTIONS, GEOPOLITICS AND MARKET RISK U.S. midterm elections and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will likely weigh on global stock markets. The average drawdown in U.S. markets is historically much greater in a mid-term election year compared to any other.14 The silver lining is that more often than not, markets have bounced back strongly in the year following those elections.15 Russia has swiftly achieved pariah status and we believe will remain uninvestable for some time unless there is a regime change, a prospect that will add further uncertainty and global market turmoil. Our work on 27 geopolitical conflicts since 1939 shows markets have had a probability of being up 70% of the time a year out after the conflict.16 Disruptive geopolitical events are abruptly discounted by global markets in the short term, while the underlying economic context tends to prevail over the medium to longer term. The commodity price shock as a result of the current geopolitical situation has been significant and, if sustained, could present an altogether different challenge for the global economy, with the potential to affect the monetary policy cycle, growth and earnings cycles. Panic selling by retail investors who opened trading accounts for the first time during the pandemic could add further pressure. From the United States to Europe, millions of people opened trading accounts for the first time in 2021 and in the U.S., net purchases of stock topped $1 trillion for the first time,17 a trend that has continued so far this year. IN SUMMARY Economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has been derailed by geopolitical concerns. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has further advanced trends that were already in play. Food and energy price hikes will add to inflationary pressures as an indebted global economy prepares to tackle climate change and health concerns. Fears of continued conflict in Europe and beyond will increase calls for technology and broader protectionism, bringing a greater appreciation for the physical world. These trends will continue to shape economic, political and market dynamics in 2022—and beyond. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Stocks of small-capitalization companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets, and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more-established companies. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the Portfolio’s performance. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Cryptocurrency (notably, Bitcoin) operates as a decentralized, peer-to-peer financial exchange and value storage that is used like money. It is not backed by any government. Federal, state or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency may experience very high volatility. ESG Strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. 1 IIF, Haver 2 MSIM, BIS, IMF, McKinsey 3 Deutsche Bank 4 McKinsey, CEIC, OECD, World Bank 5 MSIM, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver 6 MSIM, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver 7 Bernstein, Wood Mackenzie, The Economist, MSIM Emerging Markets Team Research.

"Talking Points Geopolitics are often the cause of 10% pullbacks in the S&amp;P 500. 10% corrections morph into 15% corrections 50% of the time.1 We think this 10% correction is highly likely to bleed to a 15 - 20% correction at some point during Q2, and hence the S&amp;P 500 to low 4,000/high 3,000 level. A major geopolitical issue + bad inflation numbers = Shouldn’t the market be down more than 13%? Regardless of the tragic outcome in Ukraine, we have an inflation problem in the US that should continue to weigh on equities, at least for now. We do not believe this correction will bleed past the -20% level. Declines of that magnitude historically are associated with recessions. A recession just two years after the previous one would be highly unusual. The three previous bear market (non-recessionary) corrections stopped short of -20%: 1998, 2011 and 2018. Every time, the market subsequently rallied to new all-time highs within 4 months.2 Investing into every 10% non-recessionary correction has produced an average return of +15% over the following 12 months, even though the market may have become uglier first.3 The Fed anticipates inflation will subside into the spring. We agree. However, until then, the markets are operating in a vacuum. We expect corporate fundamentals will remain stronger than what many bears predict, which was the catalyst for the rapid bull market recovery in the three previous periods cited above: 1998, 2011, 2018. We maintain our original 2022 Outlook call. We continue to believe 2022 will be an “ok” year for stocks, consistent with the third year off a recession low. These tend to be characterized by strong earnings, offset by a less accommodative central bank policy. Applied Equity Advisors Positioning: If the Fed or geopolitics were going to kill the economy, the two and ten-year treasury yields would be dropping, and there would be far greater stress in the bond market. This is consistent with our view that the US economy has the power to withstand the inflation/external shocks. In a rising interest rate environment, value stocks should continue to outperform. We continue to emphasize financials despite the recent hit due to the geopolitical situation. We expect financials will be relative outperformers in a rising yield environment. We have recently trimmed back energy exposure and added to financials. Energy is under-owned but very extended. While richly-priced growth stocks have dramatically repriced, rising yields will continue to weigh on these stocks. In our experience, once bubbles pop, they don’t end in “V” bottoms. Our portfolios have been underweight in Europe, which looks like the right call, as the risk of a recession in Europe is far greater than elsewhere. However, our global European luxury consumer stocks have been taken to the shed recently. We anticipate sticking with current positioning here, as we have not seen signs of fundamental deterioration in those companies. Asia ex-Japan continues to be our biggest non-US exposure and fertile ground for finding out-of-favor stocks that have compounded at very high levels over time. These stocks continue to struggle, given the strength of the US dollar and the current fragility of the global investor especially towards China. Traditionally, the US dollar peaks with the first Fed rate hike.4 1 Since the S&amp;P 500 was incepted in 1928 through March 14, 2022. Bloomberg.

"The GP-led secondary market has witnessed a brisk pace of growth in the past two decades with a flurry of transactions in recent years. In 2021, GP-led secondaries represented 51% of the $135 billion overall secondaries market, a record year in deal volume. 1 Forecasts suggest another banner year in 2022, with deal volume expected to rise as much as 20% year on year.2 In this Q&amp;A, Nash Waterman, Portfolio Manager and Head of Private Markets Secondaries, discusses the growing opportunity set for General Partner (GP) led deals, spelling out why we believe the sector and the single-asset segment, in particular, are attracting growing investor interest. × Where did GP-led secondaries start? NASH WATERMAN (NW): Like the wider secondaries market, GP-led deals were designed to solve a problem. In the early 2000s, financial groups needed to spin out of banks and GP-led secondaries became an efficient way to lift out these assets and teams. From there, the market evolved quickly, as the suitability of GP-led deals for use in other situations quickly became apparent. Today, single-asset transactions are the fastest growing area of the secondaries segment. The deals are gaining favor, as they provide existing GP and Limited Partner (LP) investors the ability to double down on their best portfolio assets or for LPs to take liquidity, while opening up access to outside investors without the need for highly competitive bidding processes. At which point did you notice a divergence from the LP-led secondaries market? NW: In the early 2010s, GP-led secondaries experienced exponential growth driven by post-crisis fund restructurings. With the deals evolving into highly bespoke solutions, we became skilled in the more customized and surgical approach these type of transactions require. We began structuring deals to lift out the specific assets that we found to be the most compelling. Unlike traditional LP-led deals, or multi-asset GP-led deals for that matter, where secondaries investments involve exposure to multiple assets at the portfolio level, this new approach allowed us to mitigate unwanted broader portfolio risk. Fast-forward to today and the single-asset model now stands as a functionally distinct segment of the secondaries market. Early on, however, these deals were a novel concept and we had to convince GPs that single-asset deals could help to maximize value. To start, we oriented the conversation toward problem solving. For instance, we would ask, “Do you need a solution that brings in fresh capital?” or “Do you need more time to compound value for a prize asset?” Oftentimes, that potential value would be sacrificed due to a lack of funds or premature exit. Single-asset deals open the way to unlock that additional value, which is a key reason we coined the term “transformational secondaries” back before a standard nomenclature existed for these transactions. Why are GP-led secondaries so attractive to investors? NW: In our view, the sector offers the best access to top-quality assets in the middle market. Consider, too, that within private equity the penetration of secondaries activity is relatively low. In practice, this has tilted purchasing power toward buyers as primary deal activity has outstripped secondaries demand, creating a growing universe of investable assets. As a result, managers such as ourselves can be highly selective and intentional about adding positions to the portfolio and managing risk. Put simply, we are able to cherry pick the best assets in an opportunity set of holdings that GPs view as the most attractive companies in their portfolios. Relative to other segments of the secondaries market, single-asset deals stand out for their return potential. According to recent research by PJT Partners, nearly two-thirds of secondaries investors (62%) are targeting net IRRs of 20% or more in the single-asset segment.3 In comparison, return thresholds for the multi-asset GP and LP-led segments are much lower, with only 40% and 16% of investors targeting returns as high as 20% or more, respectively. Based on the fundamental performance and embedded value that we see in our own strategy, we believe that these investors’ expectations for single-asset deals are realistic and achievable for allocators deploying capital into the space today. How does an allocation typically fit into an investor’s portfolio? NW: In our experience, investors typically see these deals fitting in a few different ways. First, they view single-asset secondaries as a definitive alpha source within private equity. They see the value of the prize assets being sold, which, when combined with their shorter duration and lower volatility characteristics, make for highly compelling investments. Second, to the extent that assets are sold out of portfolios into continuation funds, an allocation to a focused singleasset secondaries fund can capture value that an investor might otherwise have lost—i.e. as an investment, they can help to fill a gap left in the portfolio. More generally, we would argue that the divergence that we’ve highlighted between LP and GP-led deals should be reflected in investors’ planning. That is to say that secondaries should not be thought of as a single bucket. The two segments exhibit different risk and return characteristics and the simple fact that the GP-led market is now larger than the traditional LP-led segment suggests that a dedicated allocation to the sector warrants consideration. These are complex investments. What skills are involved? NW: As with other differences discussed above, investment skillset is an area where LP and GP-led single-asset deals starkly diverge. The intricacies involved in sourcing, undertaking due diligence and executing on single-asset deals explain precisely why investors can earn a complexity premium in the space. Below, we explain the steps that the Morgan Stanley Investment Management Private Markets Secondaries Team has taken in each of these areas to gain an edge. SOURCING. We built a dedicated sourcing subgroup focused exclusively on deal origination. Our team members meet regularly with GPs to develop networks that will sustain a proprietary pipeline of the choicest opportunities. As incubation periods for a deals can last from three to 24 months, investing in these relationships has been critical to being a first port of call when GPs consider secondary sales. The numbers bear this fact out. In our first portfolio, roughly 70% of our deals were either exclusive or proprietary. In our second portfolio, all transactions have been either exclusive or proprietary. DUE DILIGENCE. Due diligence entails deep work in analyzing financial statements, understanding end markets and undertaking quality of earnings reports. We commission market studies and speak with customers, suppliers and industry experts to gain a real insight into the fundamentals of a given asset. As with sourcing, this requires a dedicated team, which we began building from the ground up in the advent of this market. DEAL EXECUTION. Single-asset deals involve an incredibly complex negotiation process that can take three to six months to conclude with a wide array of stakeholders. Success requires a specialized skillset to navigate potential conflicts, as transactions can include the GPs, rolling LP investors, selling LP investors as well as the new buyer group. We’ve transacted on 50 deals in this space, an amount not easily matched by our peers. From our perspective, this experience enables us to drive negotiations and become a preferred buyer for GPs. In summary, the resource-intensive nature of this space creates barriers to entry that preclude “investor tourism.” Without a dedicated and expert team experienced in single-asset deal craft, investors will find success very difficult to achieve. 1 PJT Park Hill. “Secondary Roadmap Series.” Q1 2022. 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid. × Nash Waterman Head of AIP Private Markets Secondaries AIP Private Markets Team",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/the-pick-of-private-equity-single-asset-secondaries.html
"The frequent appearance of ESG in everyday conversation is a welcome development. However, it is very important to clarify what ESG is (and what it isn’t) and employ this frequently used term in its proper context. × ESG, which is shorthand for Environmental, Social and Governance factors, is having a moment. While the concept has been around for a while, references to “ESG investing, ESG funds, ESG strategies” in the media and by data providers seem to have spiked in recent months. The term “ESG investing” is often used as a stand-in for sustainability or impact investing. It is not uncommon to hear comments along the lines of “investing in renewable energy is a key part of our ESG strategy”. In short, people assume ESG investing requires the pursuit of positive impact or doing good—for the planet or people in need. This is not the case. In our view, ESG is not about doing good, nor is it an investment strategy in itself. ESG is simply a framework that can and, we believe, should be applied to all investment diligence processes. ESG diligence aims to identify and mitigate economic, social and governance risks that could weaken or de-rail an investment. For example, a company with inadequate environmental controls may suffer damage to its revenues, profitability, reputation and valuation should an incident occur. Investors who do not follow a process that would enable them to identify this company’s environmental shortcomings before they decide to commit their capital are likely to suffer alongside it. One does not have to be a “do-gooder” to see how weak ESG can materially affect investment returns. When thinking about ESG, most people focus more on the “E” component, likely because the dangers are more tangible and potentially catastrophic. BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill is a prominent example. However, in our view, social and governance risks are equally important. Social risks occur when communities are harmed in a way that is not environment related. Wonga, a pay-day lender in the UK, saw its path to a $20bn valuation wiped out when it was accused of predatory lending practices. On the governance side, the financial press is rife with stories of managerial misconduct, from fraudulent accounting to inadequate board oversight. Theranos, for example, went from a much hyped start-up to a scandalous mess, largely in part to insufficient governance procedures. The good news is that most investment teams consider these risks when evaluating opportunities. However, they may not bucket them into discrete ESG categories or have a formal ESG investment policy or process in place. We believe that having a strong ESG umbrella to corral these risks under in a cohesive way is valuable. A robust ESG focus embedded in all stages of the investment process, from underwriting to execution and monitoring, is fast becoming the basic requirement for any serious investment organisation. In our view, simply using an “ESG overlay” or “ESG lens”, or “giving consideration to ESG factors”, will not cut it in a sophisticated world where the asset owners and stakeholders are deeply conscious of the risks they want to avoid. × DISPLAY 1: Responsible Investment Prism  × DISPLAY 1: Responsible Investment Prism How does this translate into action? An ESG policy is not credible if it remains just a policy. For it to be meaningful, we believe all of the investment staff need to be trained on it and such training should be refreshed on a periodic basis. We believe the tone of solid ESG processes is set at the top of organisations, and, as such, a senior member of the investment team should own the ESG process. The trained investment team should then proactively discuss ESG risks during the investment process and not address them as an afterthought. The ultimate test is whether an otherwise attractive investment is rejected because the ESG risk cannot be mitigated. It is also important to acknowledge that ESG is not a blunt instrument. We believe it is fine to vary the level of ESG intensity from deal to deal. An investment in chemical manufacturing will require greater consideration of environmental risks than one in the software sector. The sales practices of a business focused on the public sector may require a different level of scrutiny that those of a direct-to-consumer business. This is an evolving phenomenon and we think teams should be open to grappling with contradictions and grey areas and using a feedback loop to refine their thinking about ESG. It is also important to place ESG in its correct context along the continuum of responsible investing. ESG, as discussed, is about doing the right thing with the aim to safeguard against downside risk. It does not require a change in investment mandate such as divestment from certain sectors like extractive industries, nor does it require token efforts such as using low energy bulbs (a frequent example). ESG, in our opinion, is simply about making sure the risk of an investment failure is tightly controlled. While there may be some positive social or environmental impact from improving ESG standards, it is incidental to the investment strategy aims. Sustainable investing is about seeking to achieve long-term resilience of an investment. It can be either something inherent in any long-term investor’s process or it can be an explicit strategy. This could include looking at the environmental sustainability of the production process or the viability of the supply chain. It could also mean being aligned with market trends and consumer preferences. Examples include building back up data centres in areas less prone to flooding, switching from fossil-fuel based inputs to plant-based inputs and changing stock-keeping units to cater to the growing preference for organic products. It could also be about analysing an insurance company’s liabilities arising from coastal properties or a services company adapting robotics to deal with labour shortages as the population ages. A lot of sustainability strategies will generate clear positive impact but it is not the objective of the investment strategy. Impact investing, on the other hand, is very much a distinct strategy which seeks explicitly to do good—reduce CO2 emissions, save water, improve access of education and housing to deprived communities—while making sure the investment also seeks to generate compelling returns. Impact may have elements of good ESG and sustainable practices, but it is not always certain. An impact investing team, like any other investing team, needs to incorporate proper diligence procedures to seek to ensure that ESG risks are squared away. Investing in a solar farm or an affordable housing project does not automatically allay pollution risk or weak governance. In our opinion, embedding ESG in the investment process is crucial for any investment strategy no matter where they are focused on the investment spectrum. There is no such thing as ESG investing, but there is such a thing as employing an ESG framework to evaluate the merits and risks of an investment. We believe that, over time, as more and more teams put this structure in place, this will be known simply as “investing.” Nothing more, nothing less. × Vikram Raju Head of Climate Investing | Private Markets AIP Private Markets Team a.banner-btn { -webkit-border-radius: 25px; -moz-border-radius: 25px;border-radius: 25px; text-decoration: none; border: 2px solid #fff; padding: 10px 20px; font-size: 1.4rem; background-color: #ffffff; color: #337ab7;margin-top: 0px;display: inline-table;font-family: karlabold; } 2tileBento2 INSIGHTS SustainableSignals Survey 7 key findings emerged when we asked asset owners about their views on sustainable investing.

"Russian President Putin’s decision to launch a full invasion of Ukraine has, in a matter of days, taken the Russian economy from a globally integrated economy of scale and potential into one isolated and on a trajectory toward pariah status. Russia is being hit with unprecedented sanctions by the EU, UK and US and others, meant to be punitive in nature and only increasing in breadth and depth over the past few days. Russia announced its own retaliatory sanctions and domestic policy responses on February 28th. × The initial sanctions enacted by the G7 and EU countries last week were significant but manageable; however, the ones built up over the weekend are now essentially unprecedented for an economy the size of Russia. Their main goal is to target the financial system punitively for Russia’s attack on Ukraine—the ability of Russia to access the international capital markets, international payments systems (SWIFT), and even its long accumulated foreign reserves (Breakdown of Russian International Reserves - Pre Sanctions on Central Bank – Display 1). Display 1 Breakdown of Russian International Reserves - Pre Sanctions on Central Bank Billions USD Source: MSIM, Haver, Bank of Russia, ING, Reuters. Data as of June 2021 In the years since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia has been conducting fiscal and monetary policies seeking to insulate its economy from external vulnerabilities. In response to these latest sanctions, Russia itself has announced its own counter measures on the morning of February 28th, including freezing foreign stock holdings, hiking interest rates to 20%, banning citizens from moving capital abroad, and forcing the conversion of foreign exchange revenues from exports in rubles—in other words, Russia has imposed capital controls.1 The announcements are continuing but many lines have already been crossed, disrupting economic norms and practices that have been in place for decades. Once implemented, history and this specific situation strongly suggest that comprehensive sanctions and capital controls are likely to remain. Beyond the direct impact, these will have a chilling effect on businesses, foreign investment and perception of Russia for years to come. As long as Putin remains in power, the direction of the Russian economy appears headed toward isolation and autarky. From a global perspective, the Russian invasion of Ukraine could affect the global economy via three channels—economic growth, trade and monetary policy. The hit to economic output likely will be minimal as both countries combined account for only 2% of global GDP and trade.2 Exports to Russia and Ukraine combined account for well under 1% of GDP for each major economy such as the US, the Euro Area, China or Japan.3 Spillover caused via the commodity markets, however, could be much more material as Russia’s share in global commodity production is large for major energy sources such as oil (11%) and gas (17%), and also for precious metals (11%), industrial metals (9%), as well as wheat (11%), and fertilizers (8%).4 Ukraine’s share in global exports is large for wheat (7%) and corn (22%).5 There is also a risk to disruption in Russian PGM (platinum group metals) supply, with the country accounting for 12% of global platinum mine supply and 37% of global palladium supply, both of which are critical in the production of automobile catalytic converters (Display 2).6 Analytically, commodities generally find their way to market. From a historic perspective, oil and gas exports from Russia continued to flow throughout the Cold War. Europe relies heavily on Russia for gas imports, and gas accounts for a relatively large spending share in European countries such as Germany. Although the EU has reduced its reliance on Russian gas, Russia still provides about 40% of EU gas supply.7 Lastly the impact on global inflation and monetary policy could lead to inflation being stickier than expected and market expectations of peaking inflation in March/April could be pushed out further.

History suggests that such disruptive geopolitical events are discounted by global markets in the short term, while the underlying economic context tends to prevail over the medium to longer term. Our work suggests that over 13 major geopolitical conflicts/attacks since MSCI EM inception in 1988, the 12-month forward return for MSCI EM in USD terms is generally positive (+18.5% on average, +3.5% on median basis) with a 70% probability of being positive over the full 12-month period after onset of the event (Display 3).8 Display 3 MSCI Emerging Markets: Geopolitical Event Study Key Date Current = February 22, 2022; Conflict Key Date -6months/+12months Source: Bloomberg, Factset, Haver.

Russia will most likely remain uninvestable for global investors unless there is a change in regime While overall global economic impact could be muted in the medium term, the commodity price transmission due to potential supply issues of inflated prices of certain metals and energy support our allocation to select companies in these sectors. Equity markets may remain volatile while the conflict continues in the short term due to higher risk premium, history strongly suggests equities are driven by economic fundamentals longer term, which remains supportive for several countries and themes we have identified in EM. × Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:fit-content; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Jitania Kandhari Managing Director Emerging Markets Equity Team Eric Carlson Head of Sustainability, Emerging Markets Equity Team",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/russia-invasion-of-ukraine.html
"Is now the time to own reasonably priced quality companies with pricing power, many of which are in EAFE? Bruno Paulson explains why the International Equity Team believes so. × Even after the mild falls in January 2022, we still see markets as stretched, with the MSCI World Index on 18x forward earnings1, a multiple never seen between 2003 and 2019, on forward earnings up a massive 52% on the trough in June 2020. There are only two ways of losing money in equities - if the earnings go away or the multiple goes away, but unfortunately we would argue it is now time to worry about both of them happening, given peaky multiples on peaky earnings. On a more positive note, we would also argue that there may be two relative havens, which have struggled in relative terms over recent times, namely EAFE and reasonably priced quality and the Portfolio offers exposure to both. After a long and sustained period of relative underperformance, the MSCI EAFE Index marginally outperformed its U.S. equivalent in January, down only 4.8% in U.S. dollars (USD), versus -5.7% for the U.S. We are not suggesting that the tide has turned based on 90 basis points of outperformance in a month, but there are good reasons to be relatively optimistic on EAFE versus the U.S. The U.S. market is expensive, as reflected in Robert Shiller’s CAPE – the ‘cyclically adjusted price earnings’ ratio, based on average inflation-adjusted earnings from the previous 10 years. The current approximately 38x level of the CAPE implies negative real returns over the next decade. This is a notoriously poor predictor of short-term returns, as shown in 2021, but it does suggest that the S&amp;P Index is not likely to be a lucrative safe haven over the next decade. It also looks pricey on the more conventional forward earnings multiple, at 20.4x, while EAFE sits at a 30% discount at a mere 14.3x. This discount to the U.S. oscillated around 10% until 2015; since then there has been a steady relative de-rating for EAFE. Part of the U.S. premium is down to mix, and the tech mega-caps which have grown their share of the global profit pie. But in addition, the U.S. economy outgrew Europe across the 2010s, with annualised gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the decade of 2.3% versus the euro area’s 1.4% . This growth differential may not hold over the next couple of years, with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates2 suggesting the euro area may have higher GDP growth in 2022 (4.3% versus 3.7%) and again marginally in 2023 (2.5% versus 2.4%). The U.S. emerged faster from the pandemic, giving Europe the chance to catch-up, and is also facing higher inflation and tighter labour markets, meaning more tightening is likely to be required, with the associated risks of economic damage. The OECD estimates Q1 2022 inflation of 6.4% for the U.S., twice the 3.2% of the euro area. The cost pressures on corporates also seem tougher in the U.S., where unit labour costs were up 3.2% in the first nine months of 2021, while they stayed flat in the euro area. If it does prove to be the case that Europe can combine faster growth with less inflation and cost pressure, that may well drive a relative re-rating. Time for Reasonably Priced Quality? 2020 saw a growth bubble in expensive and loss-making technology companies, which was followed by a value rally as the massive government interventions and the vaccines miracle drove a far stronger economic outlook. Reasonably priced quality therefore got left behind. One proxy for this is the Consumer Staples sector, by far the biggest overweight for the portfolio, which lagged the overall EAFE market in both 2020 (up 6% as against 8% for the index) and 2021 (up 7% vs 11%). The sector has also had to deal with the sharp rise in commodity costs, which has put pressure on margins, given the lag until companies are able to raise prices for customers. Arguably, Consumer Staples companies have already faced much of the inflation pressure, which may now spread to other sectors during 2022. We also believe that the sector still has pricing power, and will therefore be able to preserve or restore its margins by passing on the cost rises to customers. Within the Consumer Staples sector, our holdings have been skewed towards cheaper plays, and those exposed to re-opening, as shown by the 16% discount they traded at relative to the Staples index at the start of 2020. This did not work in 2021, as the growthier names continued to re-rate and COVID waves continued. Indeed, the discount widened to 24% during the year, though the earnings growth of our names matched those of the sector. On a positive note, this left our holdings attractively priced at the start of this year, as well as positioned to benefit from the ‘post COVID’ re-opening, whenever it happens. Looking at the Portfolio more broadly, it is far higher quality than the EAFE Index, with a 24% return on operating capital and a 40% gross margin, which are both 50% higher than the index, along with a net debt/EBITDA ratio at 1.6x, which is 15% lower than the index. Less quantifiably, we believe it has stronger pricing power than the index, given this is a focus of our investment process, which could prove a useful asset as inflation bites. Despite this big difference in quality, it is only trading at an 11% earnings premium to the EAFE Index, and on a free cash flow basis this premium drops to a mere 4%. In a world of elevated multiples on what may be unsustainable levels of earnings, the focus should be on preservation of wealth, rather than chasing another year of outsized gains. In this environment, the EAFE market looks relatively attractively priced, particularly if Europe can match or exceed U.S. growth over the next couple of years. Within EAFE, we would also make the case for a portfolio skewed towards the higher quality, defensive sectors and built on companies with superior pricing power. It is time to keep the lights on, rather than trying to shoot them out. 1 Factset 2 OECD × Bruno Paulson Managing Director International Equity Team Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Previous Next",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/time-for-eafe.html
"February was marked by the escalating tensions and a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. Many asset classes were already on a downward trend since the beginning of 2022, given inflation pressures, concerns over rate hikes and deterioration in investor sentiment. However, as the situation between Russia and Ukraine rapidly worsened over February, asset classes that had already sold off, such as the major developed equity regions, sold off further, with the S&amp;P 500 moving deeper into correction territory, while the Nasdaq moved closer to a bear market. × The S&amp;P 500 (USD), MSCI Europe Index (EUR) and MSCI Emerging Market Index (USD) declined around 3.0% over the month, with the MSCI Japan (JPY) faring slightly better, down 1.1%1. Unsurprisingly, Russia was hardest hit, with the MOEX Russia Index (RUB) plummeting 30.0%1. At the same time, the price of crude oil rose to levels not seen since 2014, due to heightened concerns over disruptions to global energy supplies. The VIX2 ended the month at 303, as the conflict intensified, and international sanctions tightened around Russia. Implications on inflation and monetary policy In our team’s recent market outlooks, we have highlighted our view that inflation is not transitory, but is likely to persist, at least through the first half of 2022. A prolonged conflict would keep upward pressure on energy prices, and in turn contribute to upward pressure on inflation. However, there is likely to be a notable difference between Europe and the US in this respect, given that Europe is highly reliant on imports of Russian gas, but currently has low inventories. Our view of the impact of this crisis on inflation – and any implications for our portfolio positioning - is therefore one area of active discussion within the GBaR team. The impact of the crisis on global growth and on monetary policy are other areas of focus. Investment Implications We entered 2022 already cautiously positioned. At the time, we were talking of Russia/Ukraine tensions as a potential near-term risk and we were therefore monitoring the situation closely, but they were by no means the only risk. For example, during January, increasing evidence of US Fed hawkishness, inflation becoming embedded, concerns over decelerating growth, and deteriorating investor sentiment, were equally important in driving our forward-looking volatility expectations. This was in an environment in which certain areas of the equity market, such as US equity stocks and large tech names, still appeared overvalued. Our view is that the military conflict in the Ukraine is unlikely to end quickly; the situation is likely to worsen, before it improves. We therefore expect volatility to persist in the short term, so remain cautious in our positioning, in fact we felt it prudent to further reduce exposure to risk assets. Considering the above, we reduced equities further in February, from a level that already reflected caution. We believe that in the near term, this should position us well to weather the near-term market volatility. In addition, we remain underweight duration, given rising yields. We also made the following tactical changes: Broad Global Commodities At the beginning of February, we added an overweight exposure to broad global commodities, as an explicit hedge against an escalation in Russia-Ukraine tensions. Given ongoing signs of supply constraints within the commodity complex, we believe the downside risks to this trade are limited. We increased this position towards the end of February given our concerns at the speed with which the situation was deteriorating, and the increased likelihood of a full-scale invasion, such as we now have seen. European Banks At the beginning of the month, we reduced exposure to US Financials, in favour of their European counterparts. At the time our view was that European banks may benefit more from rising net interest income on higher rates, and may deliver higher capital returns, than their US counterparts. Since then, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has changed the dynamics, requiring a review of the position towards the end of the month. UK Equities We moved overweight UK equities, expressed through the FTSE 100, providing a blend of value and defensiveness through exposure to energy, materials, and consumer staples companies. We believe that an attractive valuation discount and lower (real) rate sensitivity, adds to the defensive character of the FTSE 100 in the current environment. Active US Growth For portfolios which allow active funds, we trimmed the US growth active managers, in favour of broader S&amp;P 500 exposure, to achieve a small underweight in large and mega-cap growth stocks. With slowing growth, near-term inflation pressures, and rising nominal and real rates, we expect to see continued pressure on US mega-cap names, which still trade at substantial 12-month forward PE premiums to the broader market.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser’s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio’s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio’s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. × Andrew Harmstone Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Manfred Hui Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Select Product(s) Right Click Edit",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/russia-ukraine-risk-and-investment-implications.html
"Our expectation that financial market developments in 2022 would not be like 2021 did not take long to materialize! January was an eventful month, which led to even more interesting developments in early February, which are sure to have long-lasting effects. To recap January/early February: equities down, in many places quite sharply; credit spreads meaningfully wider; and, potentially most importantly, government bond yields up materially as central bankers, seemingly en masse, threw-in-the-towel on “transitory” inflation. The practically coordinated global central bank pivot to accelerate monetary tightening (or, in central bank speak, removing accommodation) surprised the market which had anticipated a more sedate, orderly transition to rate hikes in the 2022/2023 period. This monetary policy conflagration impacted everything. The only assets not spilling red ink were oil, the U.S. dollar, Emerging Market (EM) local (surprising, yet not surprising), and bank loans. Last month we posed three questions: How impactful will Omicron be? Should markets fear the Fed? And, lastly, will inflation fall? While the surge in Omicron infections has no doubt hit economies, its impact still looks temporary, meaning lost output in Q1 2022 will likely be made up in later quarters. Labor markets remain resilient and, probably most importantly, central banks appear to be looking through it and not changing strategy. Indeed, some highly vaccinated European countries like Denmark and the UK are in the process of eliminating all COVID restrictions and returning to normal in terms of social distancing, vaccine requirements, mask-wearing etc. It remains uncertain if these health policy changes will spread and stick. But, for now, we can assume Omicron will fade as an issue for economic activity and policy behavior, except in China, which is a significant outlier. × On the other hand, the outlook for central bank behavior has been upended. Not only has the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) not pushed back against the market pricing in multiple rate hikes in 2022, it has also effectively acknowledged that it has fallen behind the inflation curve (Chairman Powell said he was already marking up his end of year inflation forecast), necessitating a quicker than usual pivot from Quantitative Easing (QE) to Quantitative Tightening (QT – i.e. balance sheet run off). 2021 market expectations of three rate hikes shifted to five by early February, post FOMC meeting, and the possibility of hiking by 50 basis points (bps) at a meeting, rather than just 25 bps, has also been flagged. Indeed, Chairman Powell has gone out of his way to confirm that this tightening cycle will differ from the 2015-2018 cycle in several ways: rate hikes could occur faster as inflation is substantially above target rather than below and QT is unlikely to meaningfully lag rate hikes; employment is growing rapidly; wages are rising at their fastest pace in decades; inflation is picking up globally, so there is no offset from offshore deflationary pressures; and supply side issues, either on the goods or labor force participation rates, are NOT going away. If only it was the Fed acting hawkishly, it might not have been so bad. But the Fed was joined by the ECB, Bank of England, and the Bank of Canada in delivering more hawkish than expected messages or actions (in addition to the litany of emerging market central banks who continued to aggressively raise rates in January). In particular, the ECB was considered a dyed-in-the-wool dove, with no plans to raise rates or significantly reduce accommodation in 2022. Well, forget that. The ECB has caught the inflation worry bug and can no longer be expected to keep rates unchanged in 2022. It was only two months ago that analysts and the ECB were fairly convinced that there would be no need to raise rates until 2024! German government bond yields rose significantly in January as markets digested monetary policy developments. Net, net, central banks are getting their wish of tighter financial conditions before anyone has raised rates (outside of the UK, Norway and New Zealand, which have raised rates) by weakening financial markets. Lastly, the inflation outlook remains of paramount importance as central banks ARE responding to continued positive inflation surprises. There is good news and bad news on this front. First the good news. We believe inflation will come off the boil in the first quarter as energy inflation subsides. This will be the first drop in this expansion. The expected drop in developed market headline inflation does not mean that core inflation will drop, with inflation proving much stickier than anticipated. The trajectory of core inflation has been buffeted by both supply and demand shocks. While the demand should fall gradually in 2022, the supply side of economies are not recovering as anticipated. Energy prices in Europe, wages globally, but particularly in the U.S., are not behaving. As such, central bankers have adopted a much more hawkish posture to try to convince markets that inflation will not be allowed to become entrenched at a level meaningfully above medium-term targets. Core inflation should stabilize at a minimum, and hopefully fall, if only marginally, but this is not likely to happen until the end of Q1. Do not expect central banks to relieve pressure on markets in Q1. In terms of market views, we have been reducing portfolio risk given the uncertain outlook. We remain modestly long higher-yielding, shorter maturity assets (corporate credit, securitized credit, emerging markets). Economic growth should still be above trend in 2022; inflation will likely fall after the first quarter and, most importantly, we do not believe central banks want to create tight financial conditions; they want to get policy to neutral fairly quickly, but that should be it. Inflation is NOT completely demand-led and higher rates will not fix the supply side of the economy. We expect developed economy government bond yields to continue to move higher but, given how many rate hikes are now priced into yield curves, there could be some stability in the near term if inflation stabilizes. The risk is that it does not. × Display 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date  Note: USD-based performance. Source: Bloomberg. Data as of January 31, 2022.

Fixed Income Outlook January was a difficult month for financial markets. Two intertwined factors drove performance: inflation and central banks. Inflation data continued to surprise on the upside across both the developed and emerging markets. As a result, central banks continue to talk more hawkishly than before. Yields rose everywhere: on government bonds, corporate bonds, emerging market bonds, securitized assets. There was no real “safe haven” in fixed income assets except cash and floating rate products like loans. Whether or not this continues for the rest of 2022 will depend crucially on how this inflation/central bank dialectic plays out. Before getting into inflation and monetary policy, Omicron issues need to be dealt with. While we and many others were concerned about how the Omicron infection wave would impact markets, it does not look like it will be a major force in the months ahead. This is not to say it has not been impactful. It has. Recent economic data in Europe and North America has been negatively impacted. But crucially this should be temporary without having longer-term repercussions. Thus, positive trends in economic data should reassert themselves, as should current central bank behavior. Despite an expected weakening of economic activity in 2022, growth should remain well above trend in most countries, crucially in the Eurozone and United States. This is supportive for corporate and government cash flows and supportive of corporate credit in general. The widening in spreads seen so far in 2022 increases their relative attractiveness but we are leery of adding to exposure just yet. Importantly, whether this expected strong cash flow year materializes will depend heavily on the inflation outlook. For if inflation does not fall as anticipated by central banks (and the market), monetary policy settings may need to be moved to a restrictive setting with all the negative ramifications the word implies. So, what about inflation? Unfortunately, high, and persistent levels of inflation have triggered changes in monetary policy expectations. The trend of central banks globally reducing accommodation is intensifying relative to what was expected a short while ago. The aggressive repricing of short rates, none the more surprising to the market than in the Eurozone. German 5-year yields rose 23 bps in January and another 26bps in the first four days of February to their highest level since 2018! Now that is a repricing. While U.S. Treasury yields have also risen significantly this year (10-year maturities up 40 bps through February 4), they are only getting back to where they were pre-pandemic. If economies are truly returning to “normal,” there is no reason NOT to expect monetary policy settings to revert to “normal.” But, if inflation dynamics prove to be stubborn, central banks may need to push policy settings to restrictive territory, reinforcing the natural economic slowdown occurring in 2022, risking a rising probability of a recession in 2023/2024. Certainly, markets are testing central banks’ commitment to capping/reducing inflation this year by pricing more aggressive rate tightening cycles, including in the Eurozone. Importantly, central banks have not pushed back at all on market pricing. But a disconnect between central banks and the market does exist with regard to how high rates must go to achieve lower and at-target inflation. One of the biggest surprises in 2021 was the decline in real yields. This year the surprise has been the other way around. Real yields have risen substantially and much faster than anticipated. But, unfortunately, they will likely have to move higher still in 2022 if they are to return markets to “normal” pricing, consistent with medium term growth expectations. The real 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, while already rising 53 bps this year through February 4, is still significantly negative. This is a very pessimistic forecast and one unlikely to be true if secular stagnation does not return (although we cannot completely dismiss the possibility). The depressed state of real yields is a function of a variety of factors that should dissipate in importance, like excessively easy monetary policy. Importantly, the Fed needs real yields to rise to slow inflation. How high they need to go will depend on the financial market’s reaction. The more long-term yields rise, the less tightening is required from the Fed. The expected move to begin QT this year adds an element of uncertainty as markets do not have much experience in handicapping a higher rates/QT combo (nor does the Fed). Therefore, nominal, and real yields should move higher in 2022 as liquidity is withdrawn, the economy slows and inflation falls. With the global central bank “peloton” moving together, constraints on any one country’s monetary policy or level of yields is relaxed. For instance, one reason U.S. yields remained so low in 2021 (and previous years) was the huge amount of negative yielding bonds in the world. U.S. yields were high by global standards, encouraging capital inflows, capping yields. With all bond yields moving higher and global central banks tightening policy somewhat synchronously, there is more scope for ALL yields worldwide to rise. Indeed, the rise in Eurozone yields is particularly important given the extent to which euro-denominated investors have historically chased higher yields in other markets. This is an important reason why bond yields could surprise the market to the upside, assuming central banks follow through on their tightening agendas, which depends on how inflation behaves. There is a lot of front-loaded tightening priced into almost all developed market yield curves. Whether or not this happens will depend crucially on how inflation behaves through March, and eventually beyond. The pace of tightening is not the only thing to worry about. One crucial factor keeping longer maturity yields relatively low is expectations that terminal rates, i.e., the peak in policy rates, will not reach new highs. Indeed, current market expectations are that peak rates this cycle will be meaningfully lower than last cycle (2015-2018). The risk to bond valuations is that this is wrong. The Fed, for example, thinks short rates will peak around 2.5%, much higher than what the bond market is currently pricing. With inflation proving to be stubborn, there is a danger that expected terminal rates will have to be adjusted higher by both the market and Fed. There is also the risk that the reversing of QE programmes will impact longer maturity bonds in particular, given that the original rationale of many of these programmes was to drive long-dated yields lower. That said, we believe inflation will fall in 2022, growth in output and employment will slow, and the Fed will calibrate its tightening cycle as more information arrives. It may be true that this is just an inflation scare. By mid-year, when we know more about how fast inflation is falling, the Fed will be able to slow down its tightening. Of course, the opposite is true as well. In the interim, it will be hard to fight the Fed! Credit investors have become more nervous recently, causing credit spreads to widen; we think this is reflective of how tight spreads have become, anticipated reductions in liquidity and the anticipated Fed (and other central bank) tightening, rather than any meaningful increase in default or cash flow risks. Further widening could be a buying opportunity but we will need to see some stability, if not outright falls, in inflation to be confident. EM local market risk is improving as central banks get a handle on the inflation situation. Very hawkish central banks, with inflation pressures still evident, make it premature to get bullish, despite significant rate hikes in recent months. But this could change by the end of the quarter when more evidence is available on the global inflation trend. Where does this leave our views on markets? In general, we remain overweight shorter-maturity higher yielding sectors. We think high yield (HY), securitized credit and floating-rate loans will outperform government bonds, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and investment grade credit, but by less than in 2021. We think low expected terminal rates and negative real yields make longer-maturity bonds relatively unappealing. We do not think a return to neutral Fed policy is something to be overly concerned with. However, this outcome is contingent on the Fed not overdoing it, either on purpose or by accident. If markets sense recession risks rising, performance rankings will flip with investment grade and government bonds expected to outperform. Local EM looks interesting given how much central banks have raised rates. On the external side, we are more selective, but do expect high yielding sovereign bonds to reverse their 2021 underperformance. Once inflation peaks, substantial risk premiums should fall. Shorter maturity bonds are more interesting due to much higher risk premiums now priced in. How China manages their zero-COVID strategy will also be impactful both on the demand and supply sides. Developed Market Rate/Foreign Currency Monthly Review The year did not start quietly for developed market rates. In January, yields rose broadly following further hawkish sentiment from central bankers. Additionally, inflation worries continued and geopolitical concerns arose. Pressured by higher discount factors given increased rates and demanding valuations, risk assets sold off considerably. Regarding COVID, data continues to indicate that the Omicron variant is a dwindling threat. The U.S. dollar rose slightly during January.1 Outlook Central bank policy will continue to dominate markets going forward. While a more hawkish bias has been confirmed, there is still speculation about just how quickly central banks could tighten, with the Fed and others indicating they may be happy to raise rates quicker than 100 bps per year, as was typical in the previous rate hiking cycle. Overall, we see value in many emerging market currencies vs. G10, but many still have elevated risks. Amongst G10 currencies, we see limited valuation differences. Emerging Market Rate/Foreign Currency Monthly Review Broad market volatility impacted the hard-currency segments of the market, as spreads widened for both sovereign and corporate credit, and the move higher in U.S. Treasury yields had a direct hit. Local currency was essentially flat and outperformed most other areas of markets. Local sovereign debt were still negative,2 as was U.S. dollar-denominated corporate debt.3 U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign debt was also down. The asset class experienced outflows, with approximately -$2.2 billion net in January.4 Outlook We remain constructive on the emerging markets, given the balance of fundamentals and valuations. Fundamentals appear stable, with global growth and trade continuing their rebounds, albeit at a slower rate. Many central banks across EM have tightened policy well ahead of the Fed and other developed markets, and inflation appears to have potentially peaked in many spots. COVID continues to be a challenge for many EM countries, but potential “lockdown” policy responses would be the most impactful for markets and, so far, appear unlikely in most areas. Corporate Credit Monthly Review Investment grade credit spreads widened in January due to the volatility in risk markets. The news was dominated by a number of negative themes that drove sentiment – continued high inflation, Russia-Ukraine geo-political risks, and Omicron.5 The high yield market began the year with the worst return for the month of January on record. A continuation of hawkish messaging from the Fed was the primary catalyst. Treasury yields leapt, credit spreads generally widened and fixed rate products sold-off.6 Global convertibles had the worst start to a year on record as investors weighed the impact of rates rising on growth stocks. Energy names performed best along with Financials, while Technology, Communications and Consumer Discretionary fared the worst.7 Outlook We expect Investment Grade (IG) credit to trade in a range earning carry with limited capital gains from spread tightening. We continue to expect volatility in early 2022 given the current uncertainty and lack of appetite for risk positioning. Floating-Rate Loans Monthly Review Loan returns for January were favorable relative to other areas of investor portfolios, as U.S. stocks, high-grade and high-yield bonds sold off sharply during the month on expectations of rising interest rates. Results were strongest in the opening half of January as the market carried over momentum from the end of 2021, later easing in the second half of the month as market volatility increased.8 Outlook We expect continued strong technicals and fundamentals. Above-trend economic growth, the likelihood of declining inflation levels, and the possibility of Fed rate hikes should all play into an investment narrative that supports the loan allocation and thus provides support for current valuations. At the same time, broad-based improvements in credit metrics, a very low default outlook and a likely continued strong technical tone in the asset class should serve as helpful forces as well. Securitized Products Monthly Review Agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) underperformed in January with spreads almost reverting to pre-pandemic levels as the market anticipates the end of quantitative easing and potentially the beginning of quantitative tightening. The spike in rates volatility and lengthening durations from rising mortgage rates are also weighing on the sector. Non-agency Residential MBS (RMBS), Commercial MBS (CMBS) and Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) spreads were generally wider during the month, however performance varied by sub-sector.9 Outlook We believe the securitized market still offers a unique combination of low duration, attractive yields and solid credit fundamentals. We remain constructive on securitized credit and have a modest credit overweight across our portfolios. We remain cautious on agency MBS and interest rate risk, and we continue to manage the portfolios with relatively short durations. × 1 Source: Bloomberg.

There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. × Global Fixed Income Team Our fixed income investment capabilities are driven by eight specialized teams – Agency MBS, Emerging Markets, Floating-Rate Loans, High Yield, Investment Grade Credit, Municipals, Multi-Sector, and Securitized – which span the global fixed income capital markets.

"Climate change is everyone’s business. Having engaged on the issue with 95% of the companies in their global strategies, the International Equity Team discusses holding companies to account. × In 2021 we launched a carbon transition engagement programme across our global strategies. Our aim was to assess each holding’s climate risks and opportunities, understand their climate profiles and encourage improvement. We did this to ascertain our portfolios’ resilience to a low-carbon future. We engaged with 95% of all the companies we hold across our global strategies, a level far above the industry average for corporate engagement (according to a recent report by the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment, which suggests the average level is just 19% of holdings).1 Positive outcomes have followed. Six out of seven companies we own that initially didn’t have targets are now either preparing to set them or have them in place, and nine companies advanced their existing target ambitions to be carbon neutral or net zero. Broadly, at the outset of 2021, an average 54% of our holdings across our global strategies had set net zero targets or better. By the [CE(1] end of the year, this average had risen to 71%. For contrast, according to a report by Oxford University2 covering Forbes 2000 companies globally, only 21% have net zero targets. Climate change is now everyone’s business. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group 1’s Physical Science Basis report maintains it is still possible to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5°C, but only if the world acts now.3 In our opinion, tackling climate change is not only the right thing to do; it also makes business sense. Our message to companies we engage with is clear: failure to address carbon emissions is now risky business. Companies face the danger their emissions will be taxed and regulated, and they risk their competitive position, their physical assets, their reputation, their profits, their valuation and maybe even their future. For investors, evaluating corporate carbon emissions risk is now a fundamental cog in the wheel of security analysis and stock selection. The high quality, company-level information we look for is only available from targeted engagement, not simply from third-party providers. Engagement is the hallmark of our integrated environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment process. We conducted 143 ESG-related engagements overall in 2021. By engagement, we’re not talking box ticking via emails, anonymous group meetings or “speed-dating” conferences. We prefer one-on-one dialogue with management and senior company ESG specialists. Because of our size and long-term holding periods, we have the luxury of excellent access. While there are always going to be one or two outliers that are hard to meet, we are proud to say we met with nearly all our global holdings to exclusively discuss carbon in 2021. Targeted Engagement to Drive Outcomes The type of engagement we seek varies, depending on where in the climate maturity matrix an individual company sits. It could be helping kickstart their carbon journey, seeking better transparency and accountability, or challenging well-meant targets that may lack credible pathways. For those already on the right track in terms of their disclosure, targets and actions, we use engagement to both track performance and encourage continued leadership. The outcomes we’re looking for (or the risks) vary by industry. Following our first carbon-specific meeting with a quality industrial/technology holding that initially had no targets or carbon ambitions, the company invited us to engage with both them and a consultant around our views on best practice and investor expectations. In turn, this will help them formulate their carbon strategy – an outcome, in our view, that demonstrates the effectiveness of targeted engagement. In a different industry, with a company we hold in consumer credit reporting, we challenged why environmental and social targets were not included in their management incentives. They acknowledged the changing circumstances, telling us that it is now actively being discussed internally. Staying with the theme of changing circumstances, in the context of Scope 1 emissions we asked how they were measuring the CO2 footprint of staff now working from home, and the impact of a likely different working model going forward. We also challenged them on the merits of having data centres located in Texas, given heating and cooling is a significant component of their emissions. Again, they are actively considering their position here. Engagement isn’t just about challenging policies or targets; we also look to explore climate-related opportunities. Here, positive outcomes may be more distant given some initiatives are relatively recent, but they could well become more significant in time. One of our leading global exchange groups sees regulatory change as positive, with related “new projects popping up everywhere”. In their view, they’re ideally placed to create trading products in regulated markets. For another of our companies (one of the world’s leading management consultancies), their global partnerships with many of the world’s leading companies, combined with a client base which in some instances is also part of their supply network, puts them in a unique position to advance sustainable initiatives. On the supplier side, as part of the company’s goal to reach net zero by 2025, they aim for 90% of their key suppliers to disclose their environmental targets. On the partnering side, in a joint venture working with the world’s leading software company, the company is helping U.K. utility and energy companies transform the energy system and lower the cost of decarbonising the supply and demand of electricity in the U.K. This is underpinned by open data, artificial intelligence and equipping a workforce with digital skills. In our engagement with them, we pressed them on why environmental targets were not included in management incentives, while diversity and inclusion were. They have taken our suggestion on board for internal discussion. The Programme Ahead Having completed the first phase of our programme, our plan for 2022 is to continue to advocate for better outcomes in four focus areas: (i) improved transparency and disclosure; (ii) the strengthening of targets to net zero and the adoption of science-based targets and Scope 3, where missing; (iii) better alignment of management incentives, pressing for environmental and social targets to be tied to executive compensation in order to drive their fulfilment; and (iv) moving the conversation onto nature-based solutions and physical asset risk. Climate change is not something that can be tackled by an individual or small group, no matter how determined or engaged they are. But what we can do is continue to hold our companies to account, pushing for and encouraging change. What never changes is our relentless focus on owning high quality compounders at reasonable valuations. Time and again over the last 25 years, investing in companies with these characteristics has proven valuable during truly testing times, from the dot-com boom and bust at the beginning of the century, to economic recessions and, most recently, the global pandemic. Their relative resilience has shown through when it has been needed most. The strong underlying economics we prize – the steady compounding of profits over time at high returns on operating capital – are the high quality fundamentals that we continue to believe will help set the best course for attractive returns in the long term. × Nic Sochovsky Managing Director International Equity Team Vladimir Demine Head of ESG Research International Equity Team Alistair Corden-Lloyd Executive Director Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Previous Next",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/climate-change-everyones-business.html

"The inevitability of change remains constant with central bank monetary policy, global money market reform, and technological advances expected to drive changes in 2022. In the U.S., we expect the Federal Reserve to end tapering by mid-March and announce four rate hikes over the course of the new year. In a potentially rising rate environment, efficient cash management is critical to maximizing economics, both through the investments themselves and technology solutions. × Introduction Bob Dylan’s classic song, “The Times They Are A-Changin” summoned listeners to look around and recognize that although change is an inevitable and unstoppable force, we are each called to action to adopt. Dylan’s lyrics are certain to resonate with treasury managers as they face major changes in monetary policy, money market funds (MMFs) regulations, sustainability practices, and technology. How cash investors adopt to the onslaught of change may very well determine their success in 2022 and beyond. Market Overview Last Fall demonstrated just how quickly change can take place. At the time, financial markets were awash in liquidity, LIBOR was at an all-time low, and there was one Fed interest rate hike on the horizon in late 2022. But in response to persistently elevated prices, the Fed altered their stance on inflation, no longer viewing it as “transitory” but admitting “that prices have remained higher for longer than expected.” At the same time, they announced plans to end their asset purchase program sooner than expected, opening the door for a series of interest rates increases beginning as early as March. The Fed’s current projections suggest three rate hikes this year, another three in 2023, and two more in 2024. Our expectation is relatively in line with the Fed, to have at least 4 rate hikes in 2022 in addition to beginning the gradual reduction of the Fed’s balance sheet. It is important to remember that even with the Fed speeding up their tapering program and rate hikes starting, absolute rates will remain below historic average levels and are simply normalizing from emergency settings. Positioning for Rising Rates The Fed pivot facilitated major moves in the rates markets that could be expected coming out of a period of extremely accommodative central bank monetary policy. Similar to other periods of change, we believe clients are best served by re-evaluating the options to manage their cash more efficiently. This can often be achieved by synching investment objectives, risk parameters, and time horizon with the investments themselves. Taking a step back, it is important to spend a moment talking about investor psychology when interest rates are increasing. As we head into another rate hiking cycle, we understand that many investors will likely shift their focus to shorter duration strategies. While this type of tilt may favor MMFs and bank deposits, we often need to remind investors that what is important is to ensure cash and liquid assets are managed in an efficient manner, something that can lead to maximizing income and total return. As rates rise, duration can still be your friend but only if what happens with future interest rates is less than what is currently priced into the market. A robust investment and risk management process can mitigate interest rate risk while meeting the overriding objectives of capital preservation and liquidity. This is highlighted by our approach to portfolio positioning in the Summer of 2021 when yields were at their lows and spreads were at their tightest levels. We responded to these market dynamics accordingly, with high levels of liquidity and short duration profiles until the market appropriately priced in rising rates. The changes in market expectations and year-end technicals caused credit spreads to widen, and we were well-positioned to deploy cash given our short duration profiles. Today we currently favor short-term fixed rate and longer floating-rate securities in our portfolios. × DISPLAY 1: Number of Rate Hikes Priced Into the Market  Forecasts/estimates are based on current market conditions, subject to change, and may not necessarily come to pass. × DISPLAY 1: Number of Rate Hikes Priced Into the Market Forecasts/estimates are based on current market conditions, subject to change, and may not necessarily come to pass. Key Investment Themes Major changes are also in store for MMFs in 2022 as regulators worldwide attempt to improve the resiliency of prime funds, especially in times of market stress like we experienced in March 2020. In December, the SEC released the following policy recommendations: Minimum daily liquid asset requirements increased from 10% to 25%; weekly from 30% to 50% A removal of required and permissive liquidity fees and redemption gate provisions A swing pricing requirement for institutional prime and institutional tax-exempt money funds Amendments added to address the functioning of Government constant NAV MMFs should short-term interest rate policy ever be set at negative levels The proposals are subject to a 60 day public comment period. While the industry is heartened to see the elimination of the current gates and fees regime, it is likely to use the comment period to push back hard on the mandatory swing pricing requirement. As proposed, swing pricing will likely alter prime funds in a manner that makes them somewhat unrecognizable and removes much of the utility valued by investors. Tracking the impending regulatory developments and planning for alternatives to prime funds is certain to take on more importance as we move through 2022. The elements of societal change that Dylan expressed in the song and the need to heed the call also have parallels today as sustainable and socially responsible investing play an increasingly important role in treasury management. Whether investing to generate social change or to focus on strategies investing in companies making a more positive impact on environmental, social, and governance factors, treasury teams are looking to align their strategies with the broader corporate ethos. As a result, investors will look to their asset management partners to deliver new solutions that have a more direct and measurable diversity and inclusion impacts. Adapting and adjusting to change brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and the transition to work from home arrangements have also prompted a review of treasury systems and processes to ensure that they meet the continuous changes taking place today. Outdated and inefficient processes are being enhanced or replaced with tools including cloud-based solutions, APIs, and artificial intelligence providing assistance in cash flow forecasting, decision making, and developing more optimal cash management strategies. The inevitability of change will continue to drive innovation and advancements in technology, leading to opportunities for improved cash flow forecasting and visibility, optimal cash management, and more positive economics. There are also new opportunities to use investable cash balances to offset the cost of certain treasury tools and technology. In Summary “The line is drawn, as the present now, will later be past, for the times they are a-changin’.” The last stanza of Dylan’s song speaks to change, the continual nature of change and the need for preparation. Tapering is winding down and rate increases are on the horizon. Regulators are likely to change the rules in the money market space and cash managers are looking for increased efficiency in managing their assets. Investors will likely continue to focus on ways to make an impact with their capital that are aligned with their values. While 2022 is shaping up to be a watershed year, also know that “present will soon be the past”. As always, we at Morgan Stanley are here to help and work with you to manage and adjust to the times that are a-changin’. × Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in these portfolios. Please be aware that these portfolios may be subject to certain additional risks and general market liquidity (market risk). Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. ESG Strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. × Jonas Kolk Chief Investment Officer of Global Liquidity Global Liquidity Team Brian Buck Executive Director Robert Leggett Executive Director",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/the-times-the-are-a-changin.html
"Key 2022 Macroeconomic Issues COVID-19 Transition From Pandemic to Endemic Our base case is that COVID-19 will transition from pandemic to endemic in 2022, with 2023 likely the first full normal year since 2019. Two years after the first cases of COVID-19, the world still faces tsunamis of new infections with no apparent end in sight. And while COVID-19 continues to have an outsized impact on financial assets—for example, bond market performance in the past nine months has been better explained by infection numbers than inflation, growth, or the Fed—countries, populations and governments are reacting more moderately to new waves of infections, with targeted measures such as vaccination campaigns and mandates, with masking and selective quarantines thus reducing the economic impacts of each successive wave. Indeed, current data suggests Omicron is twice as infectious as Delta, though its deadliness is lower. And though 2022 may see a few more waves, each could be of lessening severity given the improvement in the availability of medical tools in the developed world such as triple-dose vaccines, antiviral therapeutics and treatment, as well as the protection afforded by prior natural infection. Of course, the uncertainty around this base case remains enormous and, as such, well reflected in the prices of direct plays on an end to COVID, Working from Home and on full re-opening of the global economy. From Overheating to Stagflation While we still expect above-trend growth for most of 2022, by the end of 2022, the economy will likely slow to or below trend. We believe the economy entered the Overheating phase of the economic cycle in mid-2021. The GMA Team defines Overheating as above-trend growth, a closed output gap and rising inflation. The global economy grew at 5.8% in 2021,1 more than double its trend growth rate, and the output gap is now nearly closed with labor markets in many countries within the range of NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment). Inflation is now above central bank targets virtually everywhere. We expect Overheating to persist before the Stagflationary phase takes over in the second half. We define Stagflation as an environment where growth has decelerated to or below potential, but where inflation is above target and rising. For the U.S., sub-2% growth and 2.5%-3.0% inflation—which we expect by year-end 2022 - qualifies as Stagflation. Why the shift from Overheating in the first half to Stagflation by year-end 2022? In the first half of the year, contributors to growth will win the tug-of-war against detractors, but by the end of the year detractors will gain the upper hand. The main boosts to economic growth include: continued re-opening; the public to private sector hand-off as fiscal stimulus fades; still-easy monetary policy, with negative real rates everywhere in the developed world; easing supply shortages; and consumption, as approximately 15% of the $2.5 trillion of U.S. household excess savings will be spent in 2022 (with similarly large magnitudes across the world).2 Offsetting these growth boosts the following are likely to detract from growth in the latter part of 2022: The U.S. fiscal cliff, which could detract -250 basis points from U.S. GDP; the latest COVID variant, Omicron, which will hit growth in the first quarter and may delay the eventual economic normalization we expect over 2022 and into 2023; and the end of free money which will likely slow economic activity with a lag. Inflation: Partially Transitory, Partially Structural After taking two steps forward in 2021, inflation will take a step back in 2022 as the prices of core goods normalize. However structural forces have likely ended the disinflation cycle of the past forty years as the world enters a more inflationary regime akin to the late 1960s (but not like the 1970s). Core inflation has accelerated to 5%. But a very high proportion of current inflation is supply-shortage driven and thus likely to be temporary. For example, over half the acceleration in core inflation has been driven by car prices. On the other hand, inflation has broadened: median inflation, the best measure of the breadth of inflation, now points to an underlying trend in core CPI of 3.0% (from a low of 1.5% just a year ago). Many structural trends support a regime shift to higher inflation. Unlike in the prior cycle where printed money accumulated as commercial banks’ excess reserves at the Fed, in this cycle, the money printed was spent. In addition, improved bargaining power for workers, as well as changes in attitudes and demands of workers, point to higher inflation. There is also building evidence of “greenflation,” with decarbonization (net-zero emissions by 2050) adding as much 80-100 basis points to developed markets’ consumer price inflation in each the next ten years by some estimates. Importantly, unlike in the decade following the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), no deleveraging in the banking, household and corporate sectors is occurring, removing a significant source of deflation. The End of Free Money Over the past two years, the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England collectively printed over US$11 trillion (about 26% of their GDP), more than double the amount which was printed after the GFC in half of the time.3 At the same time, these four central banks cut rates to (or below) zero. Money became literally free and enormous quantities of it were (and still are) floating around. Governments availed themselves of this free money and spent more in 2020-21 than at any time since World War II.4 The combination has been explosive for economies and markets, particularly because the Fed can print money, but cannot control where it goes. All this is now reversing. Most central banks are already tapering their bond purchases or are about to. A few have started raising rates – most recently the Bank of England. For its part, the Fed has started tapering quantitative easing (QE) purchases, expects to raise rates three times in 2022, and is even starting to discuss QT (quantitative tightening, i.e. shrinking its enormous nearly $9 trillion balance sheet). Free money has been an elixir for markets. What happens when money is no longer free? The End of China’s Exceptionalism China has grown at an extraordinary pace of 9% for four decades.5 In fact, many predicted China would overtake the U.S. as the largest economy in the world by 2020. Though China has had an outsized impact on the global economy, driving approximately 28% of global growth in the past decade, its economy is still 23% smaller than that of the U.S. and its growth is likely to severely downshift to 4% or less for the following three reasons: 1) China has “gotten old before getting rich,” with its working age population estimated to have peaked in 2010, and its total population likely starting to shrink outright in 2023;6 2) China has already built out its infrastructure and housing and thus cannot keep investing at the same pace. Further capital deepening will become debt-funded malinvestment, as the property sector’s recent troubles show; and 3) President Xi Jinping, in consolidating power around himself, is in the process strangling the golden goose responsible for the Chinese growth miracle of the past forty years. Key 2022 Investment Themes Speculative Mania Bursts In the ten years before COVID-19 hit, U.S. and global stocks rose in one of the biggest and longest bull markets of the past century.7 But interestingly stocks did not show signs of generalized frothiness usually associated with long bull markets. Then in the eighteen months following the COVID-19 low in March 2020, from a near standstill, most market participants caught the bit in their teeth and pushed almost every measure of speculative enthusiasm to record levels: IPO funds raised went from $32 billion annually from 2009 to 2019 to a record $262 billion in 2021 (nearly four times the 2000 record of $65bn).8 M&amp;A activity went from $1.25 trillion annually in the last decade to $2.75 trillion in 2021.9 Inflows into equity mutual funds and ETFs reached $1 trillion in 2021, more than the past twenty years combined and significantly exceeding 2000’s $312 billion.10 Margin debt has doubled from the average of the past five years to reach more than 2% of GDP, much higher than the 2000’s when it was 1.4% of GDP.11 The meme stock craze of early 2020 has ebbed with many stocks down -50% from their peaks, but their market caps are still 10 to 20 times higher than pre-COVID-19 levels in 2019 despite revenues down 20 to 50% and no profits.12 History shows that these speculative manias tend not to last much more than eighteen months, and are followed by market corrections greater than -40%, unwinding almost all of the bubble’s gains. Highly speculative and expensive assets are most at risk: the crypto ecosystem, retail/ meme stocks, no-profits stocks, hypergrowth high-multiple stocks and probably growth stocks in general. There are already indications that some of the bubbliest areas in the market have burst, though the overall market continues to make new highs, powered by an increasingly small number of mega-cap stocks. Possible catalysts for a more generalized market correction include The End of Free Money, the fiscal cliff and Stagflation. Or it may just be that stock market optimism and expectations are so high that they are very unlikely to ever be met. The Value Bull Market Is Only Getting Started Value stocks in the U.S. and globally have entered a structural bull market, in which they could outperform growth stocks by as much as 100% over the next five to seven years. If one properly defines Value (the way the Global Multi-Asset team believes it does: by removing sector/industry bias, equal weighting each stock, and focusing on the cheapest quintile of stocks), Value has outperformed Anti-Value (i.e. the most expensive quintile of stocks) by +26% since April 2020. We believe this marks the beginning of an uptrend, which is mirrored by our global measures of Value: Value outside the U.S. has outperformed Anti-Value by +28% since its low in 2020.13 Nonetheless, Value remains nearly the cheapest it has ever been. Today, U.S. Value stocks trade at 11x forward earnings, with Anti-Value stocks at 37x. This is well below the average historical relative discount of Value stocks to Anti-Value. If relative multiples returned to historical averages the result would be a 69% re-rating for Value stocks. The likely catalyst for this normalization would be higher inflation and the end of quantitative easing and zero interest rates, which would be favorable for Value stocks’ fundamentals as well as their valuations relative to longer-duration Anti-Value stocks. The Rise of the Rest (of the World) For the past ten years, the U.S. stock market benefited from the best of all worlds compared to its foreign peers and, as a result, has spectacularly outperformed. U.S. stocks rallied +428% cumulatively since 2010 with non-U.S. stocks up only +96% in USD terms, a +332% outperformance.14 Non-U.S. developed equities are now trading at a record -30% discount to U.S. equities, and emerging markets ex-China equities are trading at a -43% discount (approaching the Asian Crisis low of 47%), on relative forward P/E.15 Many factors supported U.S. outperformance, most of which are likely in the process of reversing. Back in 2010, U.S. equities stood near 15-year lows relative to the Rest of the World on price-to-book valuations.16 In addition, the U.S. dollar was the cheapest it had been since the early 1970s. During the 2010s, U.S. economic growth was double that of emerging markets ex-China (in real US$ terms) and 50% faster than that of other developed economies (in real terms). Partially as a result, U.S. listed company profits were up +376%, massively outpacing Rest of the World profits of +123% (in U.S. dollar terms).17 Non-U.S. regions were buffeted by economic and political crises such as the eurozone peripheral crisis, the Fragile Five18 emerging economies in 2013, the Oil Collapse of 2014, the China Devaluation in 2015, and Brexit in 2016, as well as various political crises in Brazil and other emerging markets, while the U.S. remained relatively stable. U.S. companies benefited from a corporate tax cut as well as its sector mix. U.S. tech and internet stocks made up of 19% of U.S. benchmarks in 2010 and ended at 40% in 2021.19 Meanwhile, in the rest of the world, tech and internet stocks were just 7% of market cap (in 2010 and now). This benefited U.S. stocks as tech and internet outperformed the rest of the U.S. market by +448%.20 Looking forward, most of the above factors are no longer as favorable: U.S. equities have the highest relative valuations in history vs. the Rest of the World and the U.S. dollar is expensive (though not extreme). From their current record-high levels, U.S. corporate margins are more likely to suffer downside pressure from labor costs, taxes, regulation and the possible re-shoring of supply chains. Lastly, a high tech and internet index weighting was very helpful in one of the biggest Growth bull markets in history, but these sectors are likely to suffer from the end of the pandemic boost to digital and virtual activities, high valuations and excessive profits expectations, greater regulation and anti-trust enforcement, and the incipient signs of potential excessive capital investment. Economic prospects still may favor the U.S. over the rest of developed markets but even there, the U.S. is starting to face many of the same problems as its peers (e.g. increasing size of government, expansion of the welfare safety net, slower population growth etc.). Commodities Still Beat Stocks and Bonds Commodities had a very strong year in 2021—as is typical during the Overheating phase of the cycle—rallying 33%.21 As mentioned, we expect to remain in the Overheating phase for a few more quarters before transitioning to Stagflation. Historically commodities have been the best performing asset class during Stagflation. While commodities’ financialization in the past two decades mean they are more sensitive to a risk-off environment even if fundamentals remain strong, and China (where growth is slowing) has become a bigger source of demand for most commodities than the U.S. except for oil, two structural factors should keep commodities well-supported. First, severe underinvestment in oil &amp; gas, as well as in most other industrial metals and bulks. Oil investment globally peaked at $779 billion in 2014 and in 2020 fell as low as $328 billion, and global mining capex peaked at roughly $160 billion annually in 2012-2013 and has averaged roughly $80 billion annually from 2016-2020.22 Second, decarbonization might require enormous quantities of some commodities which current production (and future production at current investment levels) would be incapable of meeting, thus causing “greenflation” (inflation in commodities required for the electrification and greening of the global economy). × 1 Haver Analytics 2 MSIM Global Multi-Asset team estimates; Haver; Factset. 3 MSIM Global Multi-Asset team analysis; Haver.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equity securities’ values also ﬂuctuate in response to activities speciﬁc to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. High yield securities (“junk bonds”) are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities (MBS and ABS) are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difﬁcult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Portfolio, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Real estate investment trusts are subject to risks similar to those associated with the direct ownership of real estate and they are sensitive to such factors as management skills and changes in tax laws. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the Portfolio’s performance. Illiquid securities may be more difﬁcult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). By investing in investment company securities, the portfolio is subject to the underlying risks of that investment company's portfolio securities. In addition to the Portfolio's fees and expenses, the Portfolio generally would bear its share of the investment company's fees and expenses. Subsidiary and tax risk the Portfolio may seek to gain exposure to the commodity markets through investments in the Subsidiary or commodity index-linked structured notes. The Subsidiary is not registered under the 1940 Act and is not subject to all the investor protections of the 1940 Act. Historically, the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") has issued private letter rulings in which the IRS speciﬁcally concluded that income and gains from investments in commodity index-linked structured notes or a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary that invests in commodity-linked instruments are ""qualifying income"" for purposes of compliance with Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""). The Portfolio has not received such a private letter ruling, and is not able to rely on private letter rulings issued to other taxpayers. If the Portfolio failed to qualify as a regulated investment company, it would be subject to federal and state income tax on all of its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates with no deduction for any distributions paid to shareholders, which would signiﬁcantly adversely affect the returns to, and could cause substantial losses for, Portfolio shareholders. Cryptocurrency (notably, Bitcoin) operates as a decentralized, peer-to-peer financial exchange and value storage that is used like money. It is not backed by any government. Federal, state or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency may experience very high volatility. LIBOR Discontinuance or Unavailability Risk. The regulatory authority that oversees financial services firms and financial markets in the U.K. has announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions for purposes of determining the LIBOR rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022 , LIBOR may no longer be available or no longer deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on or impacting certain derivatives and other instruments or investments comprising some of the Fund’s portfolio. × Cyril Moulle-Berteaux Head of Global Multi-Asset Team Global Multi-Asset Team Sergei Parmenov Managing Director Global Multi-Asset Team",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/2022-global-multi-asset-team-outlook.html

"While co-investing has been a feature of the private equity industry for many years, it is a more recent and growing trend in the hedge fund industry. We believe that hedge fund co-investments are an important tool to increase the total return of portfolios, while limiting correlation to traditional asset classes and core hedge fund strategies. Co- investments can also be used to respond more rapidly to dislocations in markets. × Why are we seeing growth in hedge fund co-investment opportunities? Prior to the global financial crisis the hedge fund industry experienced strong inflows. Many hedge funds enjoyed relative freedom to pursue niche opportunities and put less liquid investments into side pockets. In recent years, industry inflows have been more limited and investors have been more restrictive on permissible investments, particularly less liquid situations. ×  Source: HFR® Global Hedge Fund Industry Report – Fourth Quarter 2021 as of January 2022 × Source: HFR® Global Hedge Fund Industry Report – Fourth Quarter 2021 as of January 2022 As a result, hedge funds have had less discretionary capital available to deploy. This has coincided with regulatory changes that have decreased bank and insurance company willingness to invest in non-traditional asset classes, creating more opportunity for alternative forms of capital to fill that void. The end result has been an increase in hedge funds seeking co-investment capital for discrete opportunities that do not meet the liquidity, concentration or asset class guidelines of their main funds. From the investor’s perspective, returns, fees, transparency and correlation are key focal points when it comes to hedge fund allocations. In our view, co- investments have the potential to provide improvement on all three fronts. In short, we believe co-investments offer a clear and self-sustaining value proposition to hedge fund managers and investors. For managers, co-investments represent a new form of capital that enables them to participate in high-conviction opportunities that, absent co-investment capital, they would not be able to pursue. For investors, co-investments offer a means of direct access to differentiated sources of return with potentially bespoke risk/return profiles as well as attractive fees, transparency and control rights. How do hedge fund co-investments differ from private equity co-investments? The primary difference is the universe of managers from which co-investments are sourced. Co-investing is a mature concept for private equity firms. Indeed, many private equity managers have established and often contractual processes for how co-investments are allocated among existing clients. Co-investing is a newer concept for hedge funds. Most hedge fund managers do not have a long list of existing investors with whom they have traditionally partnered on such investment opportunities. At the same time, most hedge fund allocators are not equipped to make decisions about co-investments. As a result, these opportunities tend not to be as heavily trafficked as private equity co-investments and there tends to be greater potential for tailoring implementation strategies. Another important difference is the breadth of asset classes accessible through each of the two categories. Private equity co-investments typically involve control private equity positions that are subject to the same factors that influence valuation of public equities. Hedge fund co-investments represent a diverse array of asset classes, liquidity profiles and risk. They can be “risk-on” or “risk-off” and everything in between. They can range from publicly traded equity and debt to non-traded investments, such as litigation finance and reinsurance, which have no correlation to traditional assets classes. For this reason, we would generally expect that hedge fund co-investments would have lower correlation to global equities than private equity co- investments. Hedge fund co-investments also tend to have shorter holding periods than private equity co-investments. How are hedge fund co-investments sourced? Today, sourcing is entirely dependent upon having access to a robust network of idea-generators. The most obvious sourcing channel comes from hedge fund managers with whom an investor has existing primary fund investments. However, it is increasingly common for hedge fund managers to solicit co-investment capital directly from allocators with whom no primary fund relationship exists. This is happening because few hedge fund managers have existing investors with active co-investment programs and managers recognize co-investments as an opportunity to broaden their client base and support future business growth. There is also a growing trend toward fundless sponsors or emerging hedge funds offering co-investments in order to establish investor confidence. What are the key barriers to entry? While we believe there are many potential benefits to making co- investments, there are challenges as well. Broadly speaking, we see four key barriers to entry: SOURCING: Having a wide network of existing hedge funds—idea generators— and a pipeline for new ones is critical. The greatest advantage in this space comes from the luxury of choice, having access to a wide range of potential opportunities and being selective. ANALYSIS: Co-investing requires integrating a hedge fund manager due diligence framework with asset- specific underwriting. Many hedge fund investors are not structured or resourced to support this two- pronged approach. EXECUTION: Co-investing requires efficient decision making, often over the course of mere days. In addition, legal documentation and vehicle structuring must be accomplished far more rapidly than is required in traditional fund investing. CAPITAL FLEXIBILITY: Co-investments are often presented because the hedge fund manager has constraints on size and/or liquidity that prevent inclusion of these ideas in a main fund. Investors must have the mandate and appetite to be flexible around these parameters in order to maximize their opportunity set. How is alignment typically achieved with the hedge fund manager? Generally speaking, alignment is achieved in two ways. It can come from assurance that a manager has “skin in the game”, investing personal capital alongside that of external investors. And it can come through fee structures that are akin to “sweat equity”. There are a wide range of fee structures (including no fees), but structures are typically skewed toward realization-based incentives over a performance hurdle whereby a manager is only compensated if the investment achieves the investor’s objectives. What is the role of co-investments in client portfolios? What are the trade-offs? We believe the primary role of hedge fund co-investments in client portfolios is to potentially increase expected return. Secondary benefits may include improving transparency, reducing average fees and introducing targeted exposures that are not correlated to existing allocations. The trade-offs are that co-investments are resource-intensive and require quick response times. In addition, they can have higher risk and wider distributions of outcomes than traditional fund investments. Finally, co-investments may require more onerous contractual liquidity. Conclusion In our view, hedge fund co-investments have a distinct role to play in well-balanced portfolios, offering important diversification benefits to traditional asset classes as well as hedge funds and opportunistic investments. We believe that hedge fund co-investing will reach the level of adoption currently found in private equity, leaving significant runway for growth in the years ahead. × Jarrod Quigley Managing Director AIP Hedge Fund Solutions",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/the-rise-of-hedge-fund-co-investments.html
"The US Equity Market: Seems to me what’s transpired year-to-date is a microcosm of what’s to come for the year. It’s a close battle between the positives and negatives. The equity market convulsed when we heard from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in January. His decidedly more hawkish tone sent shivers through the equity markets. Remember, at this stage of an economic recovery, it is not that unusual for the Federal Reserve to begin shifting policy and reducing liquidity. Tightening financial conditions weigh on equities, especially the more speculative stocks. However, the fourth quarter earnings reports for corporate America was good news overall. Clearly the earnings misses get the headlines, nevertheless, consensus earnings estimates for the S&amp;P 500 for 2021, 2022 and 2023 are higher today than they were at the end of 2021.1 Overall, corporate America is healthier than Wall Street has expected.2 Throw in the resumption of strong company stock buybacks, and there is your good news for stocks. Seems to me, this battle might be with us for most of the year. As I have articulated, this type of environment is not unusual for the third year of an economic recovery. In the end, Applied Equity Advisors believes 2022 will be an ‘ok’ year for the market return overall, just not as strong as what we’ve seen the last few.3 Despite lower returns, 2022 will offer more opportunities for tactical alpha generation at the allocation level. We’ve already seen this. By the third week of January, the market seemed completely focused on the bad news and had dropped over 10% peak to trough. That offered a buying opportunity, as shortly thereafter the market recovered on strong earnings reports. × "" Don’t let the bears scare you out of taking advantage of the selloffs, and, likewise, don’ chase when there is too much market strength.* We believe it should be a ‘reversion to the mean’ type year. AEA Style Positioning: We remain committed to a value bias in the US, for two reasons: Value stocks are always cheaper, but in recessions they get very cheap. Post recessions, they trade back to a normalized level. They are not at that level yet.4 We think the economy could be moving into a period of permanent higher inflation. More like the 1960s…higher growth/higher inflation, the antithesis of the period of 2010- 2019. In that environment, we think inflation-sensitive stocks, which reside in the value bucket, could outperform for an extended period. However, we are less negative on growth than we have been, given the magnitude of underperformance of growth stocks. As we have discussed, in many ways the chase into growth/technology stocks post the COVID lows reminded us of the NASDAQ bubble of 2000. We felt that the uber growth stocks were trading at the same levels of extreme valuation.5 Once the bubble pricked it was going to be ugly, which it has been.6 However, the more established mega-cap technology stocks never traded to the same frenzied level. That is how the environment today is different than it was in the year 2000. Recent underperformance despite numerous impressive earnings reports means many of these large-cap growth names are now trading at very reasonable valuations. We would NOT recommend selling growth here. 3. The one group that continues to appear expensive to us are the defensive stocks.7 Bull markets don’t tend to end with investors willing to pay such premiums for relative safety. AEA Geographic Positioning: 1. We regularly hear the calls from strategists that this will finally be the year to favor Europe over the US. It is true that Europe is cheaper and has more of a value bias. However, it’s one thing to make broad general calls like this and yet another to actually pull the trigger and reallocate assets out of the US to Europe. Simply put, as an investor would you be comfortable selling Berkshire Hathaway, the largest US financial, to buy HSBC, the largest European financial? Would you sell Adobe to buy SAP or Amazon to buy Siemens?8 We certainly find some European stocks attractive, but I question jettisoning superior-performing companies for lesser ones, just because “they are cheaper”.9 2. The region of the world that has seen companies compound at rates competitive with great US companies is Asia ex-Japan.10 While that region woefully lagged in 2021, causing a drag on our performance for our global strategies, we continue to believe this is a better allocation for non-US assets than in Europe (or Japan for that matter). Simply put, we believe finding great companies that are temporarily out of favor a far more enduring strategy than investing in laggard companies, hopeful that better results are to come. × 1 On December 31st, 2021, the consensus estimates, according to Factset, for 2021, 2022 and 2023 were $204.95, $223.46 and $245.01. As of February 10, 2022, they are $207.79, $224.89, and $247.53. 2 The bears love to point out that “the earnings revision ratio is peaking”. I have heard this doomsday call since early last year, but the positive earnings beats simply continue. To me, looking at the second derivative of earnings reports and trying to project the future is dubious. It’s like saying that the Golden State Warriors are having a bad year, because while they have the second-best record in the NBA, they are not “winning by the same percentage as last year”. A win is a win, just like an earnings beat is an earnings beat. 3 A high single-digit returning year would be historically consistent with the third year off the mid-recession bear market low. While I am not a strategist and don’t regularly set price targets for the S&amp;P 500, a 5,100 year-end S&amp;P 500 would imply an approximate 8.1% total return for the year off a 4,779 start to 2022. 4 While value stocks have certainly done well recently, as they did in the second half of 2020, they did not outperform in 2021, as measured by Russell Growth compared to Russell Value indexes. Bloomberg. 5 The fifty fastest growing stocks in the Russell 1000 traded to an even higher valuation in 2021 than they had at the NASDAQ peak in 2000. Factset. 6 At its low in late January, the ARK Innovation ETF was off -57% from its high. Bloomberg. 7 The earnings stability factor, a measure of defensive earnings resilience, now trades at two standard deviations expensive relative to where it has traded for the past 26 years. 8 For example only. None of these securities are owned in AEA active strategies. 9 As of this writing, Berkshire Hathaway has compounded at a 15.06% annualized return for the last decade. HSBC is only at 3.17%. Adobe has compounded at 31.90%, while SAP at 8.75%. Amazon has compounded at 33.05% while Siemens at 8.75%. As measured in US dollars. Bloomberg. 10 From 2010-2020, the three largest stocks in the MSCI Asia ex Japan Index compounded at an average annualized return of 25.77%. In 2021, they returned -5.61% on average. Bloomberg. * At the low of January 27, 2022, the SPX was off 10% from the high. At that level, a year-end target of 5,100 offered 18% upside. But at the high on January 3rd of 4,797, there was only 6% upside to 5,100. × Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Andrew Slimmon Head of Applied Equity Advisors Team Featured Funds Global Concentrated Portfolio MLNIX | Class I Global Core Portfolio MLMIX | Class I US Core Portfolio MUOIX | Class I Previous Next",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/equity-market-commentary-feb-2022.html

"Summary In the second paper of our decarbonisation series, we focus on what the UN Principles for Responsible Investing (UN PRI) refer to as the ‘inevitable policy response’ to global warming and ask: why does this matter for investors? × AT A GLANCE Stronger government decarbonisation policies are critical to reaching net zero by 2050. Technology alone is not enough. Rapid decarbonisation does not have to be a material net negative to the world economy or living standards, although there are likely to be pockets of disruption. There is increasing regulatory momentum, with rapid global adoption of net zero targets and carbon tariffs, and investors should be preparing for the implications now. High-quality, low-carbon portfolios are well positioned for the for the carbon transition given their low sensitivity to carbon taxes and green technological disruption. × INTRODUCTION The challenges are immense… Although climate change concerns have surged, fuelled in part by the pandemic, the immediacy and severity of the threat to global ecosystems and economies is not broadly understood. The world is supposed to decarbonise by 2050 in order to keep global warming at 1.5 °C as laid out in the Paris Climate Agreement – but global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have not yet begun to structurally decline. On their own, new low-carbon technologies are not enough, given the enormous fossil fuel system we have built. Using BloombergNEF data, we estimate that, based on historic trends, it would take 50 to 80 years to decarbonise global electricity generation and even longer to electrify the total energy system – Display 1. × DISPLAY 1: Reduction in carbon intensity of global power generation is very slow Global Carbon Intensity (MtCO2 /TWh)  Source: BloombergNEF, New Energy Outlook 2021 × DISPLAY 1: Reduction in carbon intensity of global power generation is very slow Global Carbon Intensity (MtCO2 /TWh) Source: BloombergNEF, New Energy Outlook 2021 …but not insurmountable The key debate is whether governments can accelerate decarbonisation through radical policy mechanisms. Already, regulation has proven to be effective. European Union (EU) policies driving tougher environmental standards have helped to significantly reduce emissions over the past 15 years, even as global CO2 levels have risen – Display 2. Elsewhere, momentum is positive, with countries accounting for roughly 90% of global emissions having now set net-zero targets (as at 23 December 2021)1 – including a recent announcement from India at the UN Climate Change Conference, COP26. We expect these will start to trickle down into real economic policies over time. The pathway to success involves governments creating climate change policies with increased impact and scope, as well as greater global coordination. This does not have to be a significant net cost to the economy or a structural negative for living standards. Carbon taxes can be redistributed through green dividends or zero-sum emission trading schemes, and the building out of green infrastructure can serve as a net fiscal stimulus and a net job creator. Inevitably, certain sectors will be disrupted (e.g. coal production and power generation, oil industries, aviation etc.), but others are likely to benefit (e.g. renewable energy, electric vehicles, greener utilities etc.). GOVERNMENT POLICY TOOLS In our view, policymaking can and must play a crucial role in global decarbonisation. We advocate a combination of measures: both the ‘sticks’ to penalise and the ‘carrots’ to encourage. × DISPLAY 2: Supportive EU policies helped to reduce emissions even as global levels rose  Source: Crippa, M., Guizzardi, D., Muntean, M., Schaaf, E., Solazzo, E., Monforti-Ferrario, F., Olivier, J.G.J., Vignati, E., Fossil CO2 emissions of all world countries - 2020 Report, EUR 30358 EN, Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg, 2020, ISBN 978-92-76-21515-8, doi:10.2760/143674, JRC121460.

This does not have to be a significant net cost to the economy or a structural negative for living standards. The Sticks Raising carbon prices and taxes is the most common and obvious policy tool, given higher carbon prices will encourage both companies and consumers to switch to low-carbon alternatives faster. There are over 50 different country-level carbon pricing schemes in operation, however these cover only 20% of global emissions, and the consensus is that prices have not been high enough. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is the most established scheme, essentially operating on a “cap and trade” principle whereby dirtier companies buy credits in the market from cleaner companies to meet the cap on emissions. It is currently being expanded with more sectors and activities bring brought into scope. Several other countries are also considering carbon price schemes. Carbon border tariffs or “green border” taxes level the playing field for domestic producers of globally traded commodities such as steel, aluminium and cement. In these cases, a domestic carbon tax can lead to “carbon leakage” if buyers avoid paying the tax by importing commodities more cheaply from countries with no carbon taxes. The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the first of its kind, will be phased in from 2023 to 2026. Coal phaseout is critical to limiting climate change, given coal is the most carbon intensive fossil fuel and coal-fired power generation is the largest single source of all global CO2 emissions. However, this is easier for richer countries with ageing coal plants, growing renewables generation and relatively flat electricity demand. Although most EU countries have already mandated the phaseout of coal power generation, large coal consumers, e.g. India, China and Indonesia, while trying to contain coal, are still building coal plants to meet growing energy demand. Reducing fuel subsidies could be impactful. Global fuel subsidies were an estimated $180 billion in 20202, including consumer fuel subsidies in emerging markets. Many governments are reluctant to cut subsidies given their political sensitivity. However, if this changes, and they come up with a way to reduce subsidies or decouple them from fossil fuel use, this would have roughly the same effect as introducing a carbon tax system. Bans on Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicle (EV) targets are increasingly popular among green minded governments, and have already been announced in several countries – Display 3. In July 2021, the EU proposed a 100% reduction in new fleet emissions by 2035, effectively a comprehensive ban on ICE vehicles. This is a strong incentive for car companies to shift their sales rapidly to EVs. Some of the largest car markets also have EV targets for car manufacturers, e.g. the EU has progressive targets, and China has a manufacturer quota system whereby EVs must have at least a 25% share in light vehicle sales by 2025. The Carrots Green dividends are a mechanism to make carbon taxes more palatable by redistributing them to every voter as a “green dividend”. Consumers who switch to greener alternatives – for example, green electricity tariffs or buying electric vehicles (EVs) – become financial beneficiaries if the dividend they receive is greater than the carbon tax they pay. Such a scheme has been operating successfully in British Columbia for a number of years now. × DISPLAY 3: More than 20 countries have either electrification targets or ICE bans for cars 3,4,5  Source: IEA (2021), Global EV Outlook 2021.

Green infrastructure stimulus provides government support for the massive increase in infrastructure investment that decarbonisation requires. Obvious targets include electricity grids, energy storage, EV charging points, rail networks and energy-efficient buildings. The EU Green Deal has pledged €1 trillion to help reach net zero by 2050, but estimates are the total climate and energy investment gap is €2.6trn over the next ten years, suggesting more investment will need to be generated. THE INVESTMENT IMPLICATIONS Though the exact implications for companies and investors may be hard to quantify, it is clear that carbon is rapidly becoming a key consideration in company analysis. Carbon pricing should reduce long-term demand in carbon-heavy industries such as coal and oil. Tougher carbon policies are also likely to upset the relative competitive landscape within some carbon-heavy sectors, as companies who have invested into cleaner technologies are likely to take market share at the expense of those who have not (e.g. in auto manufacturing). Furthermore, companies offering decarbonisation solutions and low-carbon alternatives in any sector may benefit from accelerating policy support at the expense of carbon laggards. And, as consumers become more aware of the impact of climate change, carbon will likely become a key driver of individuals’ purchase decisions, meaning consumer brands with superior carbon profiles would be relative winners. × "" While indications are the individual will be no worse off from more robust regulation, for corporates, there will be winners and losers and asset owners must have a process in place to help mitigate climate change risk in their portfolios. Bottom Line: Reducing Carbon Uncertainty One way to reduce “carbon uncertainty” in a portfolio is to focus on companies that are high-quality compounders. These companies are typically naturally carbon-light, benefit from pricing power and resilient demand, and face lower carbon disruption risks than most other companies. For instance, the estimated impact of a $100 tax per tonne of CO2e on the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of companies held in our global portfolios is less than -1.5%, versus the MSCI World Index at up to -14% (for Scope 1 and 2 emissions) – Display 4. Therefore, we believe their compounding ability should be preserved even in an environment of rapidly tightening carbon policies. × DISPLAY 4: Our portfolios should be better positioned to withstand decarbonisation disruption trendsCarbon Sensitivity of EBIT (5-yr avg) to $100/tCO2e price7  Source: Morgan Stanley Investment Management, FactSet, Trucost.

Data as at 30 September 2021 for Strategy Representative Accounts. IN CONCLUSION Policy making can and must play a crucial role in global decarbonisation. To be effective, it must be more coordinated and the price of carbon necessarily higher. We advocate a combination of both stick and carrot measures. While indications are the individual will be no worse off from more robust regulation, for corporates, there will be winners and losers and asset owners must have a process in place to help mitigate climate change risk in their portfolios. A low carbon, high quality portfolio is one way to help position investors for what’s to come. × 1 https://climateactiontracker.org/climate-target-update-tracker/ 2 Source: IEA Energy Subsidy data (2021). 3 Please note that this list is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not fully representative of all countries with electrification targets or ICE vehicle bans. 4 Targets as of 20 April 2021. 5 Electrified vehicles include battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), depending on the definitions of each country. 6 ZEV = zero-emission vehicle (BEVs, PHEVs and FCEVs). 7 The $100 tax/per tonne of CO2e scenarios for the MSCI indices are illustrative estimates. Impact is calculated using the 5-year average Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) and assumed carbon costs for each company in the index, excluding companies without carbon data. Assumed carbon cost is determined as tonnes of carbon equivalent emissions (Scope 1 and 2) multiplied by $100. Calculations ignore any carbon costs already in existence (e.g. the EU ETS). × FURTHER READING Review the basics of decarbonisation in our first paper, which sets out essential facts that are helpful for investors to know when it comes to climate change.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy’s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. × Vladimir Demine Head of ESG Research International Equity Team Candida de Sliva Executive Director International Equity Team Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I Previous Next Download the original research paper Decarbonisation: the Inevitable Policy Response - Long Version 10/26/2021",https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/decarbonisation-the-inevitable-policy-response.html
"Measuring Growth and Maintenance Investments Organisms allocate energy between growth and maintenance and repair. They stop growing when maintenance requires all of the energy. Substitute capital for energy and companies appear to follow a similar trajectory. This is important because you can anticipate a company’s growth only if you understand how much capital it spends on growth versus maintenance. Estimating maintenance spending offers insight into how fast a company has to run just to stay in place. Most executives and investors likely underestimate maintenance spending. Steps toward better understanding include a proper assessment of maintenance capital expenditures and a separation of selling, general, and administrative expenses into investment and maintenance components. × Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Counterpoint Global consists of 54 people, including 30 investors, four disruptive change researchers, two consilient researchers and two sustainability researchers.
