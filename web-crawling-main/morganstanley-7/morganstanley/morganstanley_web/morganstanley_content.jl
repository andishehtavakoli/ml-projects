{"content": "July saw a rally in major developed markets, which had their best month this year, despite the U.S. going into a technical recession. The S&amp;P 500 (TR) (USD) was up 9.2%, the MSCI Europe (TR) (EUR) followed at 7.6% and the MSCI Japan (TR) (JPY) was up by 4.0%1. Emerging markets did not receive the same boost, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (USD) marginally down -0.2%1. The last week of July saw a broad-based decline in yields globally. The U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield moved down from 3%2 at the end of June to 2.64%3 by month end. The VIX index also moved down to 213. \u00d7 Despite the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) surprising to the upside at 9.1%4, a lot of pessimism over inflation prospects appears already to be priced in. There is evidence that demand may come down, and has already done so for gasoline5, as consumers feel the impact of high inflation and a slowing economy. A technical recession, with U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) coming in negative for the second consecutive quarter at -0.9% (Q2 2022)6, did not deter markets, which rallied. With the Federal Reserve hiking 75bps7, as expected, in the same week, markets may be sensing peak hawkishness. Remaining in the U.S., Q2 earnings have beaten expectations and guidance for the next quarter appears not as bad as markets feared. However, though we have seen a substantial derating in valuations, we do not think equities have priced downward revisions in earnings. Depending on the depth of the slowdown to come, our estimates suggest earnings for the S&amp;P 500 should be 12% \u2013 19% lower than current levels8. This supports our belief that recent strength in developed markets is a bear market rally, so we could still see further downside. Investment Implications We remained defensive throughout the month, seeing earnings revision downgrades as the next major potential headwind for equities. Our overall fixed income exposure also remained unchanged, in an environment of high inflation, rising rates, continued geopolitical concerns and intensifying threats to global growth. However, within equities, commodities and fixed income, we made a number of tactical changes: Energy We reduced our overweight to energy. While supply constraints persist with U.S. producers, demand destruction is evident in the U.S.. As global growth continues to slow, cyclical headwinds will likely intensify, which should be negative for oil prices and the energy sector. UK, Value and Growth Equities We moved from overweight to neutral UK Equities, an overweight we had held since February 2022 and, likewise, moved from overweight to neutral Value Equities. For both, economic cycle dynamics warrant a reduction in cyclical exposure. Instead, we allocated to broad-based equities, to maintain stable equity exposure. For portfolios which have active funds, we continued to reduce allocations to growth-oriented active funds. China A Equities We added to our overweight China A, first implemented in June 2022, which we continue to believe should benefit from improving growth prospects and supportive policy backdrop, whilst the rest of the world experiences monetary tightening and slowing growth. Broad Commodities We moved overweight to neutral broad commodities due to slowing growth and signs of less supply-demand imbalance. We took profits on this position, held since the beginning of February 2022. This was initially an explicit hedge against escalating Russia-Ukraine tensions, which we held given the tight market. Agriculture First initiated in early May, we moved overweight to neutral agricultural commodities. Inventories are greater than expected, leading to less support for prices in the second half of the year. Gold We reduced our overweight to gold. Near-term upside potential is limited based on its long-held relationship with real yields and our view that real yields should stay in positive territory. European Investment Grade Credit We moved from neutral to overweight European Investment Grade Credit. Spreads appear already priced for material growth slowdown. This, coupled with slightly cheap Bund yields, should lead to a more favourable risk/reward set up, as the global economy is in the late stage of the cycle. U.S. High Yield We moved from neutral to underweight U.S. High Yield, given our cautious outlook on U.S. growth and consumption. We believe U.S. High Yield may suffer more from a potential economic shock over the coming months compared to higher quality credit. Euro (EUR) We moved from underweight to neutral, as the euro is pricing in bearish economic growth in the eurozone and we may have reached peak fear on Russian gas supply. Likely elevated energy prices should maintain pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) to be hawkish in forthcoming months. This should support interest rate differentials, which are already inferring higher EUR/USD. With downside risks likely largely priced in the eurozone, the euro could start to revert to fundamentals in 2H 2022. Japanese Yen (JPY) We moved first from underweight to neutral, then to overweight, as the downside to JPY against the USD appears to become more and more limited. Interest rate differentials, oil prices and other fundamental drives indicate the JPY is undervalued.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser\u2019s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio\u2019s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio\u2019s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. \u00d7 Andrew Harmstone Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Manfred Hui Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Select Product(s) Right Click Edit", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/bear-market-rally.html"}

{"content": "As monetary policy normalizes post-covid and market volatility increases due to inflation and other concerns, investors may be seeking ways to add resiliency to their portfolios. It could therefore be an opportune time to consider the inherently risk-mitigating characteristics of long-short equity strategies. \u00d7 As the name suggests, long-short equity strategies invest both long and short in publicly traded equities and equity-related instruments. Compared to their long-only counterparts, long-short strategies are designed to have lower sensitivity to equity market movements, as measured by beta, volatility and drawdowns. When included as part of a broadly diversified portfolio, such strategies have the potential to: (1) generate profits from their long and short positions and (2) provide an element of risk mitigation, or hedge, when markets decline because gains on short positions will dampen losses on long positions. \u201cWhat is shorting? Short selling involves borrowing shares and selling them at a certain price on the assumption that the price will decline, allowing the seller to buy shares back at a lower price and return them to the owner. Short selling is only profitable when share prices decline and may be exposed to steep losses if share prices rise.\u201d \u00d7 A Broad Category With A Strategy For Every Risk Appetite A range of strategies fall under the general category of long-short equity (Display 1). In our view, the most compelling strategy in today\u2019s market environment would be a low-net or zero-net strategy, otherwise known as \u201cmarket neutral.\u201d Compared to other long-short equity strategies, market neutral strategies tend to exhibit low or zero beta, lower market risk, lower market volatility and seek to generate returns through stock selection. These strategies are not designed to shoot the lights out, but they have the potential to provide steady gains even in down markets. \u00d7 Display 1 Characteristics of Long-Short Equity Strategies \uf065 \u00d7 Display 1 Characteristics of Long-Short Equity Strategies Long-Short Strategies Are Also Actively Managed In addition to the potentially risk-mitigating benefits of including short positions, long-short strategies typically have flexibility to adjust their risk profiles in response to changing market conditions. They are not required to maintain static exposures, nor are they tethered to a benchmark. Managers of market-neutral strategies can take a variety of steps to reduce risk and protect capital, specifically: Reduce overall portfolio gross exposure by selling longs and covering shorts at the same time, so that the portfolio has less capital at risk Reduce position sizes to reduce volatility Incorporate portfolio protection in the form of index hedges, futures or options Long-Short Strategies Have Held Their Own In Prior Market Downturns During the bear markets of 2000-2002 and 2007-2008, the down markets of mid-2011 and late-2018, the chaotic beginning of 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, and the 2022 bear market, long-short equity strategies broadly, as measured by the HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index, and market-neutral strategies more specifically, as measured by the HFRI Equity Market Neutral Index, achieved their goal of mitigating downside risk relative to the broad markets across a variety of metrics (Display 2). \u00d7 Display 2 Long-Short Equity Performance During Downturns \uf065 \u00d7 Display 2 Long-Short Equity Performance During Downturns Among long-short equity strategies, market-neutral strategies have proven particularly adept at managing downside risk over time, while allowing investors to participate in up markets as well (Displays 3 and 4). \u00d7 Display 3 Down and Up Capture Ratios for HFRI EH: Market Neutral Index vs. MSCI World Net (USD) Index \uf065 Source: Bloomberg as of July 31, 2022.

Four main risks will always face long-short equity investors: MARKET RISK: the risk of loss due to the impact of general market movements. IDIOSYNCRATIC RISK: the risk of loss due to company-specific factors that are generally not correlated with the broad market movement. SHORT-SALE RISK: the risk that an investment sold short generates significant losses because the stock price appreciates. LEVERAGE RISK: the risk of loss due to unexpected interaction between longs and shorts or an improperly hedged portfolio. Conclusion These are unprecedented times, and investors are likely looking for ways to increase the resiliency of their portfolios. In our view, including an allocation to market-neutral strategies in a well-balanced portfolio could provide valuable downside risk-mitigating benefits. \u00d7 Eric Stampfel Managing Director AIP Hedge Fund Team", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/long-short-equity-strategies-hedging-your-bets4.html"}
{"content": "When the 15-nation UN security council hastily called for a vote in February to condemn Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, India joined China and Qatar to abstain. It was a difficult balancing act. Delhi didn\u2019t want to alienate Russia, an important historical friend, which supplies 46% of its military equipment,1 without also antagonizing the U.S., its largest trading partner.2 India also depends on Russia\u2019s diplomatic support at the UN for its claims over Kashmir. Afterall, the Soviet Union has used its veto six times at the Security Council on India\u2019s behalf. \u00d7 For Delhi, though the abstention vote was an embarrassment, the clear and present dangers come from a prickly Pakistan and a muscular China. India is forging its own geopolitical path in this multipolar world and focusing on its strategic interests. That means siding both with Russia and joining Western alliances, such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, alongside the United States, Australia, and Japan. From Brussels to Tokyo to Washington, governments are determined to lower their dependence on Beijing. At a time of when investability in China is being questioned, shifting geopolitical realities offer India an opportunity to shine. Coupled with its geopolitical stance, India\u2019s economic condition is looking favorable for the rest of this decade. India has not been able to realize the kind of industrial transformation that turned countries like China and South Korea into miracle economies by building their manufacturing capabilities. Instead, India\u2019s economic growth was led by services unlike the Asian tigers. Recently there has been a change in the mindset from the Gandhian principles of small is beautiful, to actively incentivizing large scale manufacturing capacities through production linked incentive (PLI) schemes. These schemes have attracted interest across 14 sectors including automobiles, solar panels, and advanced batteries. Buoyed by the government's PLI scheme, India now is an exporter of mobile phones. Delhi is also focusing on import substitution in manufacturing to enhance domestic capacity and reduce external dependence. As firms everywhere reconfigure supply chains to lessen their reliance on China, India has an opportunity to increase its manufacturing, helped by a $26 billion subsidy scheme.3 Emerging sectors such as aerospace, semiconductors, and renewables should help increase youth employment. The reform measures are starting to pay off. The \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative encourages both foreign and domestic investment in the manufacturing sector; \u201cSmart Cities\u201d aims to eradicate urban squalor and \u201cDigital India\u201d targets an overhaul of government services with electronic identity, digital payments, and bank accounts. Additionally, the government has launched its Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) in an attempt to deepen e-commerce penetration and foster innovation by start-ups with a special focus on small merchants and rural consumers. Each of these are enhancements in efforts to improve the country\u2019s infrastructure. India has backed the \u201ctech stack\u201d and direct welfare and persevered with the painful task of shrinking the informal economy. Financial reforms have made it easier to float young firms and bankrupt bad ones. \u00d7 Display 1 India Missed the Global Real Estate PartyReal House Price Appreciation: 2015 \u2013 3Q21 \uf065 Source: OECD as of 3Q21 \u00d7 Display 1 India Missed the Global Real Estate PartyReal House Price Appreciation: 2015 \u2013 3Q21 Source: OECD as of 3Q21 In contrast, China continues to focus on transitioning its economy away from investment to consumption. China\u2019s economy is slowing down, faced with a shrinking workforce, industrial overcapacity, a floundering property market, a mountain of debt and renewed COVID lockdowns. A serious downturn in the property market, a key engine of GDP growth, has eroded confidence in the economy. Real estate lies at the heart of an investment cycle. While investment to GDP ratio in India hovers at 30%, China\u2019s has peaked at 45% and a big share of that is real estate investment.4 The real estate sector accounts for around 29% of GDP in China, more than double the ratio in India, according to IMF economist Yuanchen Yang.5 Excessive supply is dragging down China\u2019s heavily indebted property sector. The working-age population in China is now shrinking,6 which will further erode the demand for housing over the coming years hurting future growth. The reverse holds in India. After being in doldrums for the past 3 years, India\u2019s real estate sector is set to recover. As more of India\u2019s population heads to the cities, demand for housing increases. India\u2019s young work force stands to benefit from affordability at almost unprecedented levels in terms of mortgage payments relative to income growth, that has declined to 28% in Q1 2022 from 53% in 2012.7 House prices are 3.2 times average income in India compared to 6.7 times in China.8 In fact, the five biggest cities in the world, with the lowest rental yields, are all in China, making it one of the most expensive countries in the world. \u00d7 Display 2 India Beats China on Housing AffordabilityHome Price to Income Multiple \uf065 Source: MSIM, JPM, NBS, HDFC \u00d7 Display 2 India Beats China on Housing AffordabilityHome Price to Income Multiple Source: MSIM, JPM, NBS, HDFC Residential inventory levels have declined to a nine-year low of 24 months of sales for the top seven cities in India.9 Nominal wage growth of around 8% should fuel demand just at a time when supply has declined.10 China\u2019s economy is also more levered, with total debt to GDP at 300%.11 Chinese property developers have excessively high debt levels. Goldman Sachs expects a third of China\u2019s property firms to default this year and a massive chunk of onshore and offshore bonds are maturing by the end of 2022.12 Two of the largest have already defaulted on their offshore bond repayments. Corporate bonds of property developers are trading at less than 50 cents to the dollar.13 Household debt has risen from almost nothing in 2007 to 62% of GDP today, mainly on account of rising mortgage debt.14 China\u2019s households are refusing to pay mortgages in 50 cities.15 Chinese property firms are facing debt deflation, falling asset prices with high debt burden, whereas property markets in India have healthy debt ratios and in our view, a high probability of increasing asset prices. India\u2019s real estate sector has been cleansed of weak players. Developers have been prudent with their finances and have cut their balance sheet debt by half over the last 3 years.16 As Indian developers are not allowed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to take loans from abroad, there are no dollar-denominated borrowings in the sector. The banking sector today stands much healthier with steadily improving nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios and no asset quality concerns as such.17 According to the RBI, businesses have seen a steady net profit-to-sales growth over the past year and are sitting on piles of cash. \u00d7 Display 3 Declining Developer Debt : A Sign of Improving Property MarketsIndia Property Developer Borrowing \uf065 Source: MS Research \u00d7 Display 3 Declining Developer Debt : A Sign of Improving Property MarketsIndia Property Developer Borrowing Source: MS Research It is true that India will face headwinds from geopolitical uncertainties. Inflation and global supply chain disruptions will challenge the government\u2019s ability to smoothly manage the economy, however macro fundamentals today are stronger than that seen during the 2013-14 period. But unlike China today, Indians benefit from a healthy real estate market and global businesses seeking more resilient and cost-effective alternatives to China. The stage is set for Delhi to move forward with an investment cycle to create a path for growth. That way, India truly emerge from under the shadow of China. \u00d7 DOWNLOAD TALES FROM THE EMERGING WORLD .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:fit-content; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective.

{"content": "In this roundtable discussion, Navindu Katugampola speaks with Morgan Stanley sustainability experts Jessica Alsford, Chris Ortega and Vikram Raju about the prospects and potential pitfalls that the energy transition faces at this critical time for the global energy industry. Be it pressure from high energy prices or the need for action to meet ambitious carbon reduction targets set by national governments and corporate leaders, the status quo appears increasingly unsustainable. With the energy industry at a crossroads, the key concern today is whether the transition to alternative energy will spring forward or fall back. \u00d7 What are the roots of today\u2019s energy crisis? Do you believe that rampant price increases will help to catalyze the energy transition? Jessica Alsford (JA): The crisis has a couple of key drivers. To start, energy prices were already rising last year due to the post-lockdown surge in demand. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine exacerbated the situation. Russia, the world\u2019s third largest oil producer, supplies roughly 40% of the EU\u2019s natural gas imports.1 The war, which led to a supply shock with knock-on price rises, may temporarily slow the transition if European countries resort to significant coal-based power generation to shore up their energy security. In terms of carbon intensity, coal is approximately 2.25 times2 worse than gas. For perspective, in 2021, roughly 16% of the EU\u2019s electricity derived from fossil fuels, 27% from nuclear and 40% from renewables.2 If you input the carbon intensity metrics, for every percentage point of power generation that switches from gas to coal, we calculate that total carbon intensity increases by roughly 2%. Aside from coal, European countries may turn to liquified natural gas (LNG). Germany, for example, is planning to construct two LNG import terminals. However, LNG projects\u2019 typical three-to-five-year development timeline means that terminal construction is not a near-term solution. In our view, in any future planning, governments need to think about energy security and the energy transition as complementary and not competing pathways. Ahead of 2030, we expect a significant acceleration in energy investment in Europe, with initiatives such as the REPowerEU strategy in the works. As part of the transition, nuclear may recede as an energy source; nuclear is losing attractiveness as a solution given the perceived risks and high actual costs. Beyond this, nuclear lead times are 10 to 15 years, far longer than the roughly six years for solar and wind. Considering the infrastructure development timelines and urgency of current circumstances, how do you expect today\u2019s situation to impact the process of energy transition? Chris Ortega (CO): All considered, we expect the transition to accelerate with existing infrastructure playing a key part. There are two main reasons: costs and time. Costs can be split into the direct costs for converting infrastructure and the associated costs for building its surrounding value chain and ecosystem. To be candid, only modest savings can be achieved via these infrastructure conversions, but for many projects they are not far from a cost equivalency. Cost benefits can be garnered, however, by reducing costs related to the support systems for new infrastructure. For instance, a terminal that frequently replenishes renewable diesel requires a whole intermodal value chain surrounding the port and storage tankage\u2014e.g., rail and trucking transportation. If that existing infrastructure can be converted to be greener, that can be materially less costly across the value chain. In terms of time, relatively quick and efficient solutions, such as blending hydrogen with gas, can be cost and time effective when compared to, say, building a new plant. We expect to see more easy-to-implement solutions like these in the near term. In addition to converting legacy infrastructure, we expect upgrades to existing green infrastructure. For example, wind turbines in the U.S., which were built 15 years ago with first-generation technology, now require refurbishment to bring them up to modern standards. On a cost and time basis, we anticipate that the retrofitting and repurposing of existing infrastructure will form an integral part of the transition. Have client demands changed in response to recent events? If so, does climate investing still resonate with asset owners? Vikram Raju (VR): The short-term spike in commodity prices has obviously made people think about the energy transition. Consumers of traditional energy are a little panicked right now and are starting to rethink their reliance on fossil fuels. As a result, people are becoming more comfortable with shorter transition timelines. Moreover, putting aside geopolitical developments, the transition has been underway for years, with an array of stakeholders pursuing their own individual clean-energy agendas. We have seen companies, regulators, consumers and employees all vote with their feet and capital to advance the energy transition in their own way. Corporate leaders, for instance, must incorporate decarbonization into their strategic vision for the future when thinking about potential cost increases, the security of supply lines and what plans will resonate with markets. Therefore, from a pure private equity growth investing point of view that looks beyond climate concerns alone, we see change afoot that should support the viability of these businesses over five, 10 or 15 years. In this way, we have not really seen the trend toward transition diminish so much as accelerate. If investing in resiliency is beneficial through cycles from a corporate perspective, what are companies doing to respond to today\u2019s challenging conditions? Are they inclined to curtail capital expenditure into cleaner energy projects or commit to this strategic, longer-term investment? JA: Clearly, companies view the time frames for transition in a variety of ways. If heightened volatility and higher prices impact free cash flows this year, costly capital projects will arguably become less likely in the short term. That said, only eight years remain until 2030 and 28 years until 2050. The pressure is on for companies to act toward their net-zero targets. Consequently, we foresee significant innovation for the decade ahead, as companies test new solutions in the hope that capital costs fall by 2030 and onward. Here, a look at a specific industry can be instructive. Cement producers, for instance, are moving toward decarbonization in two stages. Stage one is comparatively inexpensive, relying on the rollout of best-in-class technology to improve thermal efficiency. In this phase, producers can reap savings thanks to reduced fuel usage and lower carbon taxes. The second stage, however, requires investment in costlier, longer-term solutions, such as carbon capture and storage, which investors hope will become less expensive ahead. Beyond timeframes, we believe that today\u2019s energy crisis actually improves the economics for alternative energy solutions. Companies will carefully consider greener options in the current environment, and we may even see traditional energy players opt to invest their strong profits into clean technology. How do you think about the role of fossil fuels in bridging the move to clean energy? For instance, does reliance on cleaner fossil fuels allow companies to avoid the more fundamental issues related to the energy transition? CO: We believe LNG will be critical in moving the world toward cleaner energy. Remember that political and corporate leaders must balance the need to reduce their carbon footprints while sustaining growth; recent history shows that LNG can play a role here. Specifically, U.S. carbon emissions have remained fairly flat for 15 years even as economic output increased threefold, with improved carbon efficiency underpinned by the switch to gas from coal. On a global level, however, carbon emissions continue to rise. In part, this reflects emerging markets\u2019 high dependence on coal. Construction is underway to expand coal power capacity by 150 gigawatts, which will mostly offset capacity retired by the U.S. over the past 15 years. Clearly, the energy transition is a global project that cannot be thought of along strict geographic lines. In the context of private markets, where do you currently see the greatest opportunities and how do you, in your investment practice, balance managing the dual objectives of climate-positive impact with returns? VR: As private equity growth investors, we focus in areas where the technology has been proven, the market exists and the investee company has an order book. To the degree that a company may have a fundamentally carbon-negative component to their business model, there is no tension in having this dual mandate. If the company succeeds, the impact solution succeeds. If it fails, it fails on both counts simultaneously. Ultimately, every company that we underwrite is carefully evaluated to ensure that it is viable, commercially attractive and has a stated commitment to net-zero emissions. For instance, we may invest in a company that supplies other businesses, helping them to avoid, reduce or eliminate the carbon footprint for their final products. In practice that might mean that we invest in a software developer that creates programs to improve energy transmission efficiency, a major constraint that has slowed the commissioning of greener energy production. In this hypothetical example, the investee company would become a crucial enabler in the infrastructure ecosystem for alternative energy. How credible are corporate plans in emerging markets compared to developed markets in terms of the transition and the drive toward net-zero? VR: On a pure economic basis, switching to renewables could be very powerful for many emerging markets. Be that for India, a net oil importer, or Nigeria, a large producer with insufficient refining capacity. We know, for instance, that for a local bank branch in Lagos, the number one cost is running diesel generators. Remarkably, introducing solar solutions could help to cut a branch\u2019s energy bill by an estimated 50%. Financing is another area where investors can make an impact. In India, for example, demand has always been there for solutions such as solar, but it simply has not been easy to translate that into greater profitability. Backing financiers to fund solar developers and buyers on the condition that they provide solar loans to these groups could help resolve this problem. As underwriters, they can discern the good from bad credits to determine the pain points and best areas to allocate capital. The cost-saving benefits can be immediate for energy consumers, while also making loan repayments manageable over a matter of years. We are seeing these types of financial services products being rolled out in places like India, where poor grid connections create demand for diesel generators, which, as we have alluded to, are ripe for solar replacements. CO: At the country and corporate level, we have witnessed a broad movement toward less CO2-intensive activities as political and business leaders aim to hit their given targets. In many cases, however, it could be argued that these actors are not necessarily reducing their CO2 emissions at the global level, which ties into my response to your previous question. For example, if companies are simply offshoring certain activities, how do we count this? If a country bans coal-based power in their country, but imports electricity from neighboring countries with more relaxed standards, does that really equate to a reduction in the carbon footprint? Simply put, no it does not. We need to be thinking about this broader picture when defining our CO2 targets because the goal is ultimately to reduce, not just shift carbon use by geography. Will the rising costs and scarcity of resources act as a barrier to green energy demand? And how can the energy transition be inclusive and affordable to a broad cross-section of society if costs fail to come down? CO: On the power generation side for wind and solar, we have seen a consistent reduction in costs alongside an increase in efficiency over time. For electric vehicles, prices primarily depend on battery costs. Unlike for internal combustion engine vehicles, batteries comprise roughly 50% of the electric vehicle value. As such, the residual value of one\u2019s electric vehicle may change as the battery life declines over time. In our opinion, this factor may spur breakthroughs in areas such as battery recycling. Recycling speaks directly to your point regarding scarcity of resources; for example, could recycling of lithium and cobalt help to meet rising demand for these key battery inputs? At the very least, we know it will help. Supply constraints elsewhere may also advance recycling developments. For instance, the Russia-Ukraine situation is impacting nickel pricing and raises questions around alternative sourcing and, frankly, other ESG issues related to conducting business in areas that are complicated from a jurisdictional and rule-of-law perspective. Thus, developing smarter ways to recycle inputs for use in next generation batteries looks like an attractive solution. The link to the value chain could help to sustain residual values in electric vehicles as well. Notably, we are only beginning to understand these dynamics better as we reach a milestone in terms of seeing trade-ins from the early adopters of electric cars. VR: Picking up on that point, the cost curve definitely has its limits. Therefore, energy efficiency and finding small fixes to help derive value in the supply chain is key. Software that helps to lower energy consumption by households, vehicles and corporates is a good example; software can also be used for efficiency gains on the power generation side. Gearboxes in vehicles can even play a part too. Individually, these are all relatively small marginal cost-savings, but together they can play a critical role in boosting efficiency and bringing down costs across the spectrum. In practice, how have you seen institutional investors address climate change within their portfolios? JA: When I started in this space around 10 years ago, strict exclusion lists predominated. Gradually, investors became interested in companies that were allocating capital toward green solutions. In conversations we have today, there seems to be a recognition that companies pass through a phase of transition, which investors can support through engagement. Of course, such engagement implies working with companies that presently may be high emitters, but which possess the potential to reduce their carbon footprint. On balance, there seems to be a much greater willingness from investors to not only invest in solution providers, but also to engage the companies that would otherwise perpetuate the status quo. VR: Five years ago, debates mainly revolved around whether climate investing could make money. From today\u2019s vantage point, we think it is fairly clear that that debate has been settled. In the industry, we have seen investors rewarded for supporting companies across a diverse range of climate-related businesses. Moreover, we saw growth businesses earning growth-like returns without penalties to returns simply because the companies operated in climate-focused sectors. Today, the adoption of climate considerations into a portfolio has become more mainstream. At the same time, debates have moved on. We see some questions around the magnitude of impact that a given dollar amount should create; currently, there is no universal metric for this. We can look at the CO2 aims, but not in a way that is clearly linked to the per dollar unit of investment. We see progress toward this aim, but for the adoption of such a metric, more people active in the industry will have to embrace the idea. CO: In our conversations with limited partners, these investors want to understand how we quantify impact. We are taking what 10 years ago was a qualitative conversation and putting numbers behind that. On a portfolio company by portfolio company basis, what impact are we having and how do we kind of continue to make sure, from a process perspective, that we are continuing to optimize? Of course, there is wide recognition that no true endpoint exists. The energy transition is more like a journey in which we continue to push forward and evolve. \u00d7 1 Source: Morgan Stanley Research, March 2022. 2 Source: Morgan Stanley Research, March 2022. \u00d7 Navindu Katugampola Global Head of Sustainability, Investment Management and the Global Head of Sustainable Investing, Fixed Income Global Fixed Income Team Jessica Alsford Global Head of Sustainability Research, Morgan Stanley Research \u00d7 Vikram Raju Head of Climate Investing | Private Markets AIP Private Markets Team Chris Ortega Americas Investing, Infrastructure Partners Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/energy-at-a-crossroads.html"}

{"content": "Despite macro uncertainties, global capital spending continues to surge after a period of short-lived contraction in 2020, powering the post-pandemic economic recovery. We expect U.S. Investment Grade Corporate CAPEX to increase +15% in 2022, maintaining the +14% year-over-year (YoY) momentum in 2021 (Display 1). Its impact on fundamental credit profile flows through all three financial statements: CAPEX is a key determinant of cash flow, of multi-year leverage trajectory and debt supply, as well as of future revenue and margins through capturing demand and increasing productivity over time. We view U.S. Technology as a clear winner, while U.S. Utilities and U.S. Telecom emerge as sectors most under pressure (Display 2). \u00d7 DISPLAY 1 Global CAPEX Is on the Rise \uf065 Source: S&amp;P Global CAPEX Survey 2021.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau 2022 Capital Spending Report (Display 3), from 2011 to 2020 U.S. non-farm businesses increased total spending from $1,243.0 billion to $1,706.4 billion, an increase of $463.5 billion (+37.3%). The increase was led by Utilities (+85.8% or $84.2bn), partially offset by the largest decrease in the Mining sector (-41.4% or $68.6bn). Underlying this trend are three driving factors: Sustainability, Supply chain, and Security. The Three Reasons CAPEX Is Rising: Sustainability, Supply Chain, Security The broader transition to a more sustainable global economy drives higher CAPEX across industries in order to reduce carbon emissions, protect water supply and improve the environmental and social impact of supply chains over the long term. Key themes include electric vehicles (EV), utility grid upgrades, transition from fossil fuels to renewables, and overall energy efficiency. \u00d7 DISPLAY 3 U.S. Census 2022 Capital Spending Report \uf065 Source: U.S. Census Bureau 2022 Capital Spending Report \u00d7 DISPLAY 3 U.S. Census 2022 Capital Spending Report Source: U.S. Census Bureau 2022 Capital Spending Report Government policies broadly incentivize and support corporate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives. The ongoing Assessment Reports of the Paris Agreement and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) helped to consolidate international support and increase corporate commitments to net zero carbon emissions, with Europe leading the way. Specifically, Europe\u2019s \u201cFit for 55\u201d package and other efforts have provided tailwinds for green CAPEX by providing command and control mechanisms such as fuel blending mandates, offering clarity in defining sustainable activities (EU Taxonomy), and adopting market-based approaches to implement carbon initiatives, which include carbon markets and border adjustment mechanisms for carbon intensive sectors such as steel, cement, aluminum, and fertilizers. Estimates on economy-wide investment requirements have an understandable spread, although they clearly exceed current capital expenditures. By 2030, annual global investment requirements to meet net zero goals are anticipated to $4 - $5.7 trillion per year in clean energy and energy infrastructure alone,1 at least three times current levels. Recent research from McKinsey suggests that using the hypothetical Net Zero 2050 scenario from the Network for Greening the Financial System, annual overall green investments needed to stay on track for net zero between now and 2050 are $9.2 trillion ($275 trillion total). While we may reflexively think of government compelled \u201cgreen\u201d capital investment as detrimental to corporate balance sheets, the European Union has put in place several mechanisms to protect European corporations from competition by taxing less-sustainable imports. The time bound, science-based goals create immediate investment pressure on both public and private sectors, particularly as the importance of achieving 2030 interim targets becomes increasingly clear. Therefore, we view Europe as a potential bellwether for the U.S. and expect to see even higher green CAPEX levels globally. Global supply chain is another hot topic\u2014strained in normal times and stressed repeatedly in recent years for a variety of reasons\u2014and U.S. corporates are diversifying manufacturing capabilities in response. They are also increasing efficiency and automation, bolstering productivity to address labor shortages and tight inventories. Labor inflation is a key leading indicator for manufacturing CAPEX. Under current conditions, we expect to see a cycle of elevated spending to improve profitability. Companies look to automate wherever possible in order to compensate for low labor levels and high wages, however these investments are initiated in sectors where demand outstrips supply and strong cash flows can fund the spending. In the theme of de-globalization, many industries are onshoring manufacturing capabilities to address shipping bottlenecks in the near-term and increase diversification longer-term. Companies in the Machinery, Electrical and Transportation equipment sectors are seeking to re-shore to reduce lead time and increase flexibility, whilst companies in the Aerospace, Communication, Automotive, Semiconductors, Chemicals, Medical products, Pharma sectors list national security and supply security as the top reason. This trend is broadly aligned with the U.S.\u2019s sustainability goals and the broader economic agenda to boost domestic GDP and create jobs post pandemic. Geopolitical security has taken on heightened importance in 2022 given the ongoing Russian/Ukraine conflict in Europe. Where it intersects with Sustainability and Supply Chain, we see CAPEX dedicated to address all these concerns take priority. Namely in Agriculture and Energy sectors, along with the push for decarbonization, we see initiatives aimed at bolstering the aggregate level of supply and diversifying away from certain regions. For example, there are discussions for the U.S. and EU to boost supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in European countries by the end of 2022, which would help reduce reliance on Russian gas and incentivize greater LNG diversification. The REPowerEU plan would not only cut Russian gas imports, but also call for an accelerated integration of wind and solar, biomethane production, and heat pump addition. The goal of these plans, in collaboration with international partners, is to chart an alternative path for Europe\u2019s energy security since Russian gas currently accounts for about 40% of total supply. SECTORS WITH STRONG TAILWINDS: Limited rating migration net of new supply. Benefits from strong government support and increased financial flexibility. We believe current CAPEX investments will directly accrue to higher productivity, better margins and drive future demand with limited impact on credit profile. The U.S. IG Technology sector is experiencing exceptionally strong underlying demand, as the pandemic both accelerated digital transformation and boosted consumer savings in the U.S. U.S. IG Technology issuers expect higher free cash flow across the board while ramping up investments to meet backlog and manage supply chain disruptions. For the IG Tech sector in particular, CAPEX spend can directly boost productivity, increases margins, and enables firms to gain greater scale. This tailwind has lifted a crop of rising stars from the BB rating category to BBB in 2021, and we expect the trend to continue. In particular, supply chain disruptions amidst this exceptionally strong demand backdrop have driven semiconductor companies to increase capital spending by $200bn+ over the next decade in the U.S. and Europe in order to secure supply. While we do expect continued debt supply from the high-rated names in the space to partly fund higher CAPEX, the impact on credit profiles and current ratings should be de minimis. Companies in the space have accumulated large cash balances, significant financial flexibility through asset sale, spin, or IPO transactions, and could expect incremental government support in boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. Overall, we expect improved credit profiles and more rising stars as strong demand creates opportunity for increased scale. SECTORS UNDER PRESSURE: Deterioration in credit profile net of new supply. Incremental CAPEX is a \u201ctax\u201d on free cashflow (FCF) and leverage profile driven by regulation and/or market dynamics. Higher leverage occurs without commensurate growth in future demand and profitability. U.S. Utilities \u2013 Over the past decade, U.S. electric utilities have intensified their capital spending, i) to reduce carbon pollution, ii) to update and replace aging infrastructure, iii) to harden systems and protect against more volatile weather and, iv) to pay for smart grid technology, increased security to safeguard against physical and cyber-attacks. Regulated Utilities\u2019 prudent capital investments can have a positive impact on their Return on Equity (ROE), as it increases their underlying rate-base. In the near-term credit metrics can be negatively impacted as CAPEX is largely debt financed and with some lag expected before cash flow begins. U.S. Telecoms \u2013 Despite heavy spending on 5G wireless spectrum and CAPEX, these investments do not necessarily lead to greater pricing power or revenues. Rather, carriers are forced to make these investments in order to not fall behind in network performance and guard their respective wireless market shares. New 5G use cases are preliminarily being contemplated (i.e. \u2013 augmented reality, metaverse, internet-of-things, fixed-wireless broadband), but monetization and business models remain far from clear. While a key company predicts that the addressable market size of \u201cnetwork-as-a-service\u201d will expand from $340 to $460 billion from 2021-26, CAPEX spending in Telecom is currently peaking and is expected to drop measurably in 2023, as major spectrum auctions generally occur every five years. SECTORS IN FLUX: Rife with challenges and opportunities, with final outcomes driven by public policy, level of government support, and management teams\u2019 choices in navigating the path forward. We believe three sectors are particularly sensitive to the future course of public policy in their respective areas. Automobiles \u2013 Global Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) CAPEX, which represents ~50% of total Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) R&amp;D/CAPEX, is estimated to increase to $120 billion between 2020 and 2025. A large portion is currently funded by higher margin SUVs/ pickup trucks on strong demand, and OEMs\u2019 continued emphasis on these vehicles over smaller/compact models. This in turn allows for the protection of operating margins that are higher than pre-pandemic levels, a positive for ratings profiles considering continued supply chain challenges and in particular, chip shortages. Over the past decade in the U.S., a variety of policies on the federal and local level have supported EV demand and helped companies scale manufacturing and battery capabilities. This was done through purchase subsidies and/or vehicle purchase and registration tax rebates, which aimed to help reduce the price gap with conventional vehicles. However, the U.S. still trails Europe &amp; China in EV sales due to less stringent government mandates, differences in infrastructure investment, and consume preference. As much as 38% of greenhouse gas emissions are caused by passenger cars.2 In order to meet stringent regulatory requirements as well as stay competitive, European automakers have increased spending on future technologies (e.g. electric car batteries and powertrain, digitalization). For example, one of the leading players is planning to spend at least 55% of its R&amp;D and CAPEX budget on these technologies, ultimately reducing tailpipe emissions of its fleet as well as reducing carbon-intensity of its production plants. Energy \u2013 After decades of structural underinvestment in traditional energy sources, the sector now must contend with optimizing CAPEX in an inflationary environment with increasing energy transition mandates. Globally, oil-based fuel consumption now stands 3% above pre-Covid levels.3 Europe\u2019s pivot away from Russian natural gas supply is also supportive of U.S. LNG development. In this context, we are seeing 15-20% capital spending increases but only 0-5% production increases. The outliers are the supermajor integrated names which are raising their CAPEX budgets to around 30% growth as they pick-up spending on clean energy projects. EU Utilities \u2013 European utilities continue to spend heavily on the retirement of coal plants and the construction of more renewable wind and solar generation. Coal and nuclear shutdowns have occurred rapidly, offset by a sharp rise in power prices, driving the need for replacement power, stability, and security of fuel imports. The Russia/Ukraine conflict is accelerating sustainability programs in Europe, with added urgency to a longer-term pivot away from Russian natural gas supply and bolstering future energy security. Thus far higher natural gas prices have been absorbed with subsidies from governments, passed on to consumers with tariff increases. In addition, the REPowerEU plan now calls for a two-thirds reduction in gas imports from Russia by winter 2022/23 through alternative supply sources, energy efficiency/savings, electrification, and filling storage to 90% by Oct. 1, 2022 (MS Equity Research). Nuclear generation has been controversial: it is a core component for France but opposed by Germany. However, in order to accelerate transition, new construction for both nuclear and natural gas (on a temporary phase out basis) have been included in the EU taxonomy for new project spending.Another area of focus is the expansion of network grids. This includes greater regional interconnectedness, support for EV charging, and smart grids to improve efficiency for consumers. Pharma/Healthcare/Life Science &amp; Diagnostics \u2013 The Covid pandemic was a key catalyst for increased manufacturing and R&amp;D spending, where we see 50-100% increases among Life Sciences &amp; Diagnostic companies compared to pre-Covid levels. Higher CAPEX alone has limited the impact on sector credit profiles, with rating trajectory and balance sheet capacity largely determined by M&amp;A, and the outcome of U.S. drug pricing legislation. SECTORS THAT HAVE HIGH MAINTENANCE CAPEX and could benefit from targeted, long-term solutions that address higher input costs in an inflationary environment. U.S. Transportation: Airlines have heavy CAPEX commitments over the next few years as they focus on fleet renewal and right-size capacity, taking delivery of newer, more fuel-efficient aircrafts which would both lessen the impact of higher commodity prices and drive environmental goals longer-term. Travel demand and input costs are significant drivers for the sector. Trucking is moving towards automation to offset a tight labor environment, which requires large upfront costs. Rails are mostly focused on keeping CAPEX at 15% of revenue or below given continued focus to remove costs and improve profitability, though recent productivity initiatives mainly seek to offset inflationary pressures. Environmental Services: Another CAPEX intensive sector with an average spend at 12% of revenue expected for 2022, in-line with historical averages. At least one notable company is directing incremental investments in renewable natural gas capacity, as part of its broader push for sustainability initiatives and improved investor perception of the sector. Paper &amp; Packaging: CAPEX guidance increased across the board for a core group of IG issuers in 2022, aimed to drive organic capacity growth in a tight supply environment, and automation of existing assets to manage labor supply shortages. \u00d7 DISPLAY 4 CAPEX Summary: Credit Profile Winners and Losers \uf065 Source: Morgan Stanley Investment Management IG Research.

Forecasts/estimates are based on current market conditions, subject to change, and may not necessarily come to pass. The fundamental impacts of CAPEX tell one piece of the story When we think about investment allocations by sector, the effect of CAPEX on credit profiles is only one piece of the puzzle, one that must be tied to our fundamental views on valuation. The debate about where spreads are going and what is already priced in at current levels remains the key focus for credit investors. Given elevated CAPEX over a multi-year time frame, we could expect to see increasing debt supply which may push spreads wider. We offer here a visualization of potential fundamental and technical drivers of spread changes resulting from CAPEX outlook. This is based on survey responses of MSIM Fixed Income research analysts on supply outlook and credit profile trajectory of issuers in our benchmark indices. Display 4 above illustrates the relationship between directional changes in credit profiles against expected CAPEX growth and size each sector on relative scale of future CAPEX. \u00d7 Download .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Risk Considerations Diversification neither assures a profit nor guarantees against loss in a declining market. There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. \u00d7 Victoria Li Executive Director, Research Alana FitzGerald, CFA Associate, Research \u00d7 Jim Caron Chief Strategist, Fixed Income Richard Ford Head of Investment Grade Credit Joseph Mehlman Head of U.S. Investment Grade Credit $( document ).ready(function() { $(\".authorTitleName a:contains('Victoria Li')\").html(\"Victoria Li, CFA\"); $(\".authorTitleName a:contains('Joseph Mehlman')\").html(\"Joseph Mehlman, CFA\"); }); Angie Salam Head of U.S. Non-Financial Research Elena Ciampichetti Head of European Non-Financial Research Patrick Holt Analyst, Research Jackie Desir Vice President, Research Kerwin Bailey Vice President, Research Michael Deich, CFA Executive Director, Research Matas Vala, CFA Vice President, Research Jeffrey Chiu Analyst, Research Raymond Singh Executive Director, Research Henry Mason Senior Associate, Calvert Jun Goh Associate, Calvert Sam Rodgier Associate, Calvert \u00d7", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/capex-reshapes-credit-profile-sectors-in-flux.html"}

{"content": "The equity markets have had a terrible first half of 2022, with the MSCI World Index down over 20% in U.S. dollars (USD), the worst start to the year in over 50 years. The bizarre element is that the fall has all been down to derating, as earnings have not yet been hit. The earnings estimates for 2022 and 2023 are both up slightly, meaning that the 12-months forward earnings number is up 5% this year as it benefits from the increasing weight of the higher 2023 estimate as the year progresses. \u00d7 The derating is arguably less bizarre given the extreme multiple at the start of the year, which at 19.3x forward earnings was 36% above the average between 2003 and 2019, the 17-year period between the bursting of the tech bubble and the pandemic \u2013 during which the multiple never even reached 17x. The derating has taken the multiple down to 14.6x, only 3% above the 2003-19 average. This has clearly reduced the multiple risk from here, shifting our concern to the prospects for earnings. Unfortunately, there are plenty of grounds to be anxious about earnings, even if inflation helps revenue growth, at least in nominal terms. The major threat in the short term is the prospect of an economic slowdown or recession. Central banks are attempting to counter inflation by dampening demand through higher rates. They are hoping to calibrate their rate rises to achieve a soft landing, and economic forecasts seem to think that this is achievable, with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) predicting 1-2% growth for the USA and the euro area for 2023, with inflation falling and unemployment only rising marginally. The issue is that monetary policy can be analogous to trying to shift a brick by pulling on an elastic band \u2013 there is no effect until suddenly the central bank, along with the economy as a whole, gets a brick in the face. What is clear is that there are no signs of any risk of downturn in the current earnings numbers, given the continued robustness of the estimates. The risk to earnings is raised further by the current record level of margins, with the MSCI World Index forward EBIT1 margin edging up further to 16.7% this year, as against a 13.3% average and a 15.2% peak in the 2003-19 period. It seems that the excess demand is allowing companies to pass on even more than the rise in their input costs, be it through inflation (raising prices), \u2018shrinkflation\u2019 (reducing product sizes) or \u2018skimpflation\u2019 (trimming the level of services). Any end to shortages, or worse still a shift to excess supply, could end this phase of generalised pricing power, with more commoditised companies suffering, while genuine pricing power holds up better. In the longer term, there could be further pressures on earnings, be they from rises in interest costs, the need to build more resilient supply chains, companies paying for the negative externalities they create, and even potentially from higher corporate tax rates as governments look to repair their finances. The Global Financial Crisis of 2008-9 provides an interesting precedent. The market peaked in October 2007. The first phase of the market fall was a drop of 15% over the next eight months to summer 2008, even though forward earnings rose, as the market derated \u2013 a clear parallel to the 2022 experience so far. It was only in the second half of 2008 that the earnings started to fall sharply, along with a further erosion in multiples, to arrive at the market trough another eight months later in early 2009. Whatever happens from here in 2022-23 will not be a repeat of 2008-9. However, the market\u2019s earnings are distinctly vulnerable given their current elevated level and the probable economic slowdown. Our focus on compounders, with recurring revenues and pricing power, should mean that the portfolio\u2019s earnings are more robust than those of the market, as was shown in 2008-9 and more recently in the first half of 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis. Given that earnings are the major risk from here, after the significant derating that has already happened, it arguably makes sense to minimise earnings risk from here by owning compounders. \u00d7 1 Earnings Before Interest and Taxation \u00d7 Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy\u2019s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 Bruno Paulson Managing Director International Equity Team Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/markets-are-down-but-earnings-are-not-yet.html"}

The Next Level Fund will invest primarily in early-stage technology and technology-enabled companies that have women and/or multicultural members among their founding teams. This latest move by Morgan Stanley highlights opportunities with underrepresented business leaders, often targeting underserved markets and communities, and aims to help meet growing investor demand for impactful market solutions to address social justice, gender equality and racial equity. The fund is part of the Private Credit and Equity strategy within the Investment Management division, which oversees more than $1.4 trillion of assets.2 It will also be backed by three key corporate partners: Hearst, Microsoft and Walmart. \u201cWe are pleased to expand our impact-oriented client offerings with the addition of Next Level, and we are proud to partner with like-minded companies that share our commitment to delivering positive social impact through compelling investment opportunities,\u201d says David N. Miller, Head of Private Credit and Equity at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \u201cOur differentiated approach can help to increase access to capital for women and multicultural businesses in our target sectors.\u201d Investors have historically hesitated to prioritize investing in diverse startups, despite acknowledging the opportunity that they could be missing.3 In fact, 60% of venture capitalists surveyed by Morgan Stanley say that their portfolios hold too few companies founded by women and multicultural entrepreneurs,4 while investors in another survey reported capitalizing diverse businesses by as much as 80% less than traditional companies overall.5 \u201cBy intentionally seeking out high-growth companies founded by multicultural and women entrepreneurs, Next Level presents an exciting opportunity for disruptive startups to increase their visibility and accelerate their businesses with the support of our corporate partners,\u201d says Managing Director Alice Vilma, Portfolio Manager of the Next Level Fund. The fund will tap the expertise of the Multicultural Innovation Lab, Morgan Stanley\u2019s in-house start-up accelerator, which promotes financial inclusion by providing founders of diverse tech and tech-enabled startups with access to investors, tools, resources and connections that they need to thrive. The diverse companies will gain access to the capital provided by the fund and to the global resources and capabilities of Morgan Stanley and these corporate partners, says Vilma, who is also co-head of the Multicultural Innovation Lab. \u201cWe are pleased to be partnering with Hearst, Microsoft and Walmart on this exciting new initiative, which advances our respective companies\u2019 goals to promote financial inclusion and access to capital for women and multicultural founders.\u201d Eve Burton, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer at Hearst, will serve on the fund\u2019s Advisory Board. \u00d7 1 https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/venture-capital-funding-gap 2 As of March 31, 2021 3 https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/venture-capital-funding-gap 4 https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/venture-capital-funding-gap 5 https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/trillion-dollar-blind-spot-infographic \u00d7 Morgan Stanley Next Level Morgan Stanley Next Level is the impact-focused private equity business of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, focusing on privately negotiated equity and equity-related investments with impact.", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/investing-in-startups-founded-by-women-and-multicultural-entrepreneurs.html"}
{"content": "The tectonic plates of inflation and recession collided in June with recession winning, at least for now. Economic data continued to underperform, surprising to the downside in general, with central banks continuing or even intensifying their hawkishness. As a result, financial market performance in June and year to date cannot be characterized as anything but historic; unfortunately, historically bad! Indeed, global credit markets have experienced their worst first half performance on record. June bond returns ranged from -0.88% for U.S. Treasuries to -9.19% for emerging markets (EM) external high yield, pushing year-to-date returns into double digit negative territory.1 What is truly astonishing about 2022 has been not just that all fixed income returns have been deeply negative but that the dispersion of returns has been so small. In EM, high grade and high yield returns have been -19.69% and 20.96% respectively while U.S. High Yield has returned -14.04% while U.S. Investment Grade returned -14.39%.2 It has not mattered how you managed credit versus duration risk, both have been equally bad. In this risk-off context, it is not surprising the dollar rose substantially, confounding many long-term dollar bears. \u00d7 Government bond markets were not exempt from the volatility, but hope did materialize mid-month as yields fell. First, U.S. Treasury 10-year yields rose 62 basis points (bps) in the first 14 days of the month as high inflation prints (May U.S. Consumer Price Index release printed 8.6%, higher than expected) and Fed hawkishness (larger than expected 75bps rate hike and a substantial increase in their \u201cdot plot\u201d) pushed the Fed\u2019s median rate forecast to 3.8% for end-2023. Then, they rallied 46bps over the remainder of the month as recession fears rose substantially and, remarkably, the market began to price out rate hikes the Fed had just penciled in. Even with recession probabilities rising significantly, government bond yields still went up over the month. Tightening expectations fell even more significantly in Europe, with expected rate hikes reduced 60-90 bps across the ECB, Swedish and Norwegian central banks. Whether or not this is warranted remains to be seen, emphasizing, once again, the importance of central bank policy outcomes for the months ahead. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date \uf065 Note: USD-based performance.

Data as of June 30, 2022. The indexes are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. See below for index definitions. Credit markets did not like either scenario (inflation or recession) so underperformed the whole month: U.S. IG spreads widened 25bps while U.S. HY spreads widened 163bps. European bonds did even worse with governments tracking Treasuries weaker and European corporates doing worse.2 The European energy crisis continues to drive inflation higher, with no respite in sight, leaving the European Central Bank (ECB) with little room to maneuver. However, recession fears came to dominate inflation worries and despite inflation making new highs in Europe (and likely to continue to do so over the third quarter) German 2-year yields fell 58bps over the second half of June, mirroring U.S. Treasury performance. The roller coaster is keeping volatility high. The collapse in commodity prices in recent weeks reflects market sentiment shifting away from inflation hedges and towards growth hedges (government bonds). The market now prices inflation will be back below 2% by 2025 in both the Eurozone and the U.S. For the first time this year, government bonds began to behave as a hedge to cyclical risk, with developed market government bonds rallying as credit markets sold off. Of course, this improved performance hinges critically on reduced central bank hawkishness, leading to investors pricing less rate hikes across the yield curve. Whether or not this is justified remains to be seen as core inflation has yet to convincingly peak and turn down. No doubt, the significant drop in commodity prices (assuming it persists) should reduce headline inflation in coming months (outside of Europe) and also, perversely for the economic pessimists, boost consumer and business sentiment, reducing the probability of recession. \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: Currency Monthly Changes Versus U.S. Dollar \uf065 Note: Positive change means appreciation of the currency against the USD.

Fixed Income Outlook June market performance emphasized once again the unusual time we live in. Volatility continues at levels rarely seen over the last two decades, with markets zigging and zagging between inflation and recession fears. Clarity remains lacking as to where economies and markets will eventually end up, but we do know some things. Despite fears of recession, the U.S. labor market and household income growth remain solid. June\u2019s labor market report released on July 8th emphasized the continuing strength and resiliency of job growth. Indeed, no recession is imminent with monthly job growth of 300,000+. As a comparison, for the decade 2010-2019, U.S. job growth averaged less than 200,000 per month. Job growth, which further squeezes a tight labour market, will, we believe, make it very difficult for inflation to come down. Moreover, to slow inflation meaningfully, real rates need to rise. While they have risen substantially from the beginning of the year, it is not yet obvious, despite weakening data, that they are high enough to slow wage growth and the housing market, two key drivers of core inflation. The market\u2019s fading of the Fed\u2019s \u201cdot plot\u201d peak of the Fed funds rate and the fading of inflation risk (falling forward inflation rates) is ambitious to say the least. Falling inflation means growth slows below trend and unemployment rates rise. So far, the growth slowdown could just be a midcycle adjustment from unsustainably rapid growth in 2021 (in both nominal and real terms). It is also possible that inflation remains elevated if the economy is weakened; i.e, a stagflationary scenario, which means the Fed is reluctant to stop tightening. As such it is premature to believe the slowdown occurring will continue or be significant enough to return inflation to the Fed\u2019s target. Inflation could be stickier than the market thinks. Similar situations exist in Europe and Asia. While we may see inflation peak this summer, in year-on-year terms, it implies the Fed is unlikely to ease as fast as market optimism suggests (2023 rate cuts). Moreover, although economic conditions look more challenging for Europe given the energy situation, the dramatic repricing of rate hikes (lower) in June also looks aggressive. Inflation in Europe shows no sign of peaking (even if most of the rise is due to supply chain/energy issues). Unless the Eurozone economy slips into recession, market forecasts of less ECB rate hikes look premature, which will likely put upward pressure on European bond yields as well. Central banks are hawkish for a reason. Inflation in most emerging markets continue to make new highs, even though they began raising rates sooner than advanced economy central bankers. This may imply that there is more tightening to come in advanced economies rather than suggesting EM central banks are nearly done. Despite evidence that growth in manufacturing has slowed significantly, the service sector of economies, as evidenced by June\u2019s Institute for Supply Management service sector report, remains in strong expansionary territory. Anecdotal evidence from the travel industry still points to robust pent-up demand for consumer services alongside labor shortages, suggesting service sector inflation will be hard to suppress. If Covid does not come back to derail this recovery, it will be a challenge for disinflation in the goods sectors to be powerful enough to lower inflation sufficiently to halt central bank tightening anytime soon. On the positive side, there is evidence that supply chain logistics are improving, albeit slowly, which should bode well for improved access to goods and lower prices. Corporate bond performance is also likely to be volatile. Both IG and HY markets reflect expectations that bad news will continue to arrive (weaker earnings, weaker economy, tighter monetary policy). Spreads have moved above the levels normally associated with a healthy economy, meaning they price in a meaningful probability of a recession relatively soon. But there is unlikely to be a recession this year, given the momentum in labor markets and healthy household and corporate balance sheets, implying that credit markets are undervalued relative to current fundamentals. But increasingly restrictive monetary policy means growth will continue to be under pressure. Q2/Q3 reporting will be key in understanding the robustness of business models to input cost inflation and a slowing economy. We continue to be cautiously optimistic on credit given the cheap to current fundamentals but our expectation of deterioration. We still think a soft landing is likely (although less likely than three months ago) with supply chains improving, commodity prices down and central banks not rushing to raise rates once neutral/slightly restrictive levels are achieved. Emerging Markets continue to struggle, but opportunities are arising as there are now countries that price in meaningfully probability of default where we believe it is unwarranted. While EM is likely to struggle as long central banks remain on their current hawkish trajectory and inflation stays high, valuations increasingly price in a highly negative outcome. With risk premiums now generous in some countries, we will look to opportunistically buy, but the asset class still lacks a catalyst to spark a rally. The U.S. dollar, usually a good barometer of the economic and financial outlook, continues to flash warning signs. It tends to be strong when things are going wrong and there is meaningful downside risk, or when things are too good, inflation is high, and economies need to slow. Well, currently these are the two scenarios most priced into financial markets, meaning the dollar goes up continually. A soft landing, slower growth, lower inflation, no recession is the scenario where the dollar is likely to fall from its clearly lofty levels. While that remains our baseline scenario, it remains a hope rather than a fact. In summary, portfolio positioning remains cautious. Valuations are more attractive, opportunistic buying makes sense, but risks remain, mostly on the inflation front and central bank reactions to it. We continue to fear inflation more than recession. Developed Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW Developed market rates were exceptionally volatile in June as the market responded to continued upside inflation surprises, hawkish central banks but then also weaker economic growth data. Initially, rates climbed sharply in response to central banks raising rates more than expected and promising to continue tightening. However, weaker economic activity data then caused yields to fall in the second half of the month as central bank expectations moderated, although 10y government bond yields still ended the month 10-20bps higher. Given higher rates and growth concerns, risk assets in general performed poorly. Medium term inflation breakevens fell below central bank target levels even though inflationary pressures remain strong.3 OUTLOOK Given that inflation has yet to disappear despite growing recessionary concerns, the focus remains on central banks: how aggressively and for how long will they keep hiking? Their current rhetoric remains hawkish, but this may change if economic growth slows further. Overall, we see developed market rates remaining volatile given the uncertainty but expect yields to trend higher as long as recession is avoided. Emerging Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW The selloff in emerging markets debt (EMD) continued through the month. The corporate index within the EMD universe was the best performing, although notably negative during the period. Investors are beginning to more seriously consider the potential for recession in the near term and EMD markets will not be spared.4 OUTLOOK We are optimistic on EMD as valuations appear to be compensating investors generously for the risks. The macroeconomic environment is challenging for all areas of capital markets, but it appears EM investors have already priced this more than most. Inflationary pressures, and corresponding central bank reactions, remain the most important factor for the asset class among other factors such as commodity prices, the evolving effects of the war in Ukraine, and China\u2019s zero-Covid policy. We expect markets to place an emphasis on differentiation amongst countries and credits. Corporate Credit MONTHLY REVIEW The May-end rally proved transitory, and weakness returned in June. The Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Index and the Bloomberg European Aggregate Corporate Index both widened over the month. Energy, equities, and commodities finished lower, reflecting the increased expectations of recession/economic slowdown. News continued to be dominated by a deterioration in fundamental expectations.5 Concerns over elevated inflation, the aggressive policy response and rhetoric central banks and growing recession fears contributed to the second worst one-month return for high yield in more than 10 years, second only to March of 2020. The June spread widening was second only June 2008, according to JPMorgan.6 Global convertibles fell for the eighth consecutive month in June, as the dual threats of rising inflation and looming recession spooked global markets. As the convertible market has shifted down steadily, bonds are now sitting on bond floors and accordingly asset class performance in June was more in line with credit than equities in a risk-off month: the Refinitiv Global Convertibles Focus Index was down compared to MSCI Global equities and the Bloomberg Global Credit index.7 The senior corporate loan market also sank in June, though it remained strong relative to other asset classes.8 OUTLOOK Looking forward we see investment grade spreads offering attractive valuations that are inconsistent with the fundamentals we see at the individual firm level. Potential catalysts for a rally include Q2 results which confirm issuer performance is stronger than market pricing suggests, or a change in macro sentiment where the risk of a recession is reduced. We remain cautious on the U.S. high-yield market as we enter the third quarter of 2022. Volatility across risk markets has continued to increase and there is little to suggest the environment for high yield will be become materially more supportive over the near-term. While we have continued conviction in the loan market\u2019s relatively healthy credit picture, the geopolitical situation in Europe clouds the outlook. Securitized Products MONTHLY REVIEW Recession fears caused securitized credit spreads to widen further in June across all mortgage and securitized products, and demand remains tepid overall. Supply is also tapering off as new loan origination slows, and secondary trading activity has also declined. Agency MBS spreads widened further in June and have now widened in 5 of the 6 months in 2022. U.S. Non-agency RMBS, CMBS and ABS spreads all widened substantially again in June, but fundamental credit performance remains healthy overall. European securitized markets spreads also widened though the housing market remains strong.9 OUTLOOK Credit spreads for many securitized sectors have returned to levels last seen at the depths of the pandemic, but credit conditions are materially better today. We believe the majority of spread widening is due to supply-demand dynamics, with near record Q1 issuance and tepid demand, due to interest rates rising, rather than fundamental credit concerns. We remain constructive on securitized credit and believe sector and security selection will become more important in the coming years if the economy softens. \u00d7 The views and opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Management team as of June 2022 and are subject to change based on market, economic and other conditions.

There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. \u00d7 Global Fixed Income Team Our fixed income investment capabilities are driven by eight specialized teams \u2013 Agency MBS, Emerging Markets, Floating-Rate Loans, High Yield, Investment Grade Credit, Municipals, Multi-Sector, and Securitized \u2013 which span the global fixed income capital markets.

Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Privately placed and restricted securities may be subject to resale restrictions as well as a lack of publicly available information, which will increase their illiquidity and could adversely affect the ability to value and sell them (liquidity risk). Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities (liquidity risk). ESG Strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. Cryptocurrency (notably, Bitcoin) operates as a decentralized, peer-to-peer financial exchange and value storage that is used like money. It is not backed by any government.

{"content": "SEC Proposal on Climate Disclosure Will Drive Real World Innovation and Speed Up Climate Solutions Washington - Corporations throughout the world are working to transition their businesses away from the use of fossil fuels because of the increasing business risks to companies from the harm this causes people, the local environment, and global climate change. This is a massive, multidecade effort that will impact the vast majority of companies and that has material implications for every living creature on the planet-and, of course, for long-term investors. The speed and the success or failure of this transition will inform quality of life for the world's population for generations to come. We are attempting to manage this with a voluntary market-led set of solutions. This is the cornerstone of capitalism. Markets need transparency to the problem. With adequate transparency, markets will finance the companies solving the problem, in anticipation of better returns. Today, we lack the necessary information from companies detailing their carbon emissions, which blocks the transparency needed to produce voluntary market-led solutions. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has proposed a set of rules for companies to disclose their carbon emissions in order to facilitate market function and to stimulate the innovation and entrepreneurship needed to hasten the transition to a cleaner energy system. As opposed to embracing this effort, many corporations and even some investors are pushing back, trying to water down or even block the SEC's efforts. In a nutshell, these companies are arguing that calculating and disclosing their carbon emissions is too complicated, too costly and could get them sued for their contributions to climate change once people see how much carbon they are discharging into the atmosphere. We suggest the free-market, capitalist approach--get the information on corporate carbon emissions out to our financial markets and solve this through innovation and market-led competition. The alternative is to have the government intervene and take some degree of control of the energy system. Transparency Is Key This is an area that should be more math than politics. Access to better climate-related data benefits all investors, allowing them to better understand the current risks to investment portfolios and to better manage such exposures. U.S. regulators have taken a measured approach to climate-related disclosure relative to other regulators around the world. It has focused on essential data to improve market function, facilitate voluntary market-led solutions and enhance competition and innovation through stronger market signals. This disclosure of information doesn't mean the SEC will then be in the business of telling the market what the numbers mean. People might disagree on the interpretation of the data, so this is unlikely to lead to universal agreement. But to attempt to eliminate or control access to this critical information would be inconsistent with improving capital market function. The Importance of Externalities It is important to have a basic framework to understand what we mean when we discuss ESG investing. At Calvert, we use the Calvert Principles for Responsible Investing to frame our information gathering and proprietary research. These correlate to globally accepted norms for responsible business conduct. You can read them on our website here. We also use the concept of externalities, which refers to the activities of a company that may result in impact to the environment or to people but are not well captured in the company financial statements. While companies create substantial positives, and they get paid for this through profits, they also create negatives. Problematic externalities include pollution, human rights abuse in supply chains, gender or racial discrimination and many others. Long-term investors like Calvert seek to understand how well companies are performing on managing all aspects of their businesses, including the elimination or reduction of harmful externalities. Some companies manage this better than others, which we think is a factor in determining which companies make better long-term investments. Over time, society figures out externalities and starts charging companies for the problems they cause. Carbon emissions are an example of a corporate externality we seek to quantify and factor into the long-term analysis of a company's future value. All else being equal, the more carbon emissions a company creates, the greater the risk to the company as society attempts to cut emissions. The Time Is Right We think that all the attention on climate change over the past decade has put society on the precipice of solving this existential crisis. Initiatives by market regulators worldwide to create more transparency to corporate externalities narrowly focused on climate change is a critical next step. The markets need the information in order to more accurately price this externality into stocks and bonds. Until we get this, markets will lack the required information and transparency to function optimally, and we will risk misallocating capital. We see companies already beginning to allocate resources in efforts to decarbonize. Examples of this can be found everywhere, including the fossil fuel industry-nearly across the board. But without transparency into carbon emissions across all corporations and the resultant market valuation of that factor, we cannot see how the markets value these decarbonization strategies. Whatever our differences are on the SEC proposal, let's be clear: This is simply about the provision of information. How one interprets the data or uses it is up to each market participant. Let's get as much transparency as possible and make our arguments in the open market, not with the regulator. Bottom line: The SEC proposal is a pro-capitalism, pro-voluntary market-led solution and may lead to improved capital allocation, increased innovation and greater competition. We should get behind it and let the markets function. Calvert's letter to the SEC related to \"The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors\" is available here. \u00d7 John Streur President and Chief Executive Officer, Calvert Research and Management Calvert Research and Management", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/calverts-view-on-sec-proposal-on-climate-disclosure.html"}
{"content": "Multi-manager platforms are experiencing a surge in investor interest. Consider this excerpt from a January 30, 2022, Bloomberg article: \u201cInvestors are plowing money into funds that don\u2019t rely on the next macro genius or star stockpicker, but instead offer an army of traders who invest in an array of strategies. These behemoths secured pretty much all of the new money in the hedge fund industry last year, cementing a tectonic shift that\u2019s accelerated since the pandemic.\u201d1 \u00d7 Why are these vehicles attracting so many investors? How do they compare with traditional hedge funds? What should investors consider if they are interested in them? We tackle these and other fundamental questions about multi-manager platforms in the following FAQ. 1. What are multi-manager platform hedge funds? Multi-PM hedge funds, hedge fund platforms, or Multi-Manager Platforms (\u201cMulti-PM\u201d or \u201cMMPs\u201d) are investment organizations that employ many specialized hedge fund managers and strategies, collectively operating as one entity, where individual units have discrete P&amp;L responsibilities. Multi-PMs share several characteristics: They are investment vehicles in which the manager oversees a number of independent portfolio management and trading teams. Multi-PMs are responsible for integrating risks and overseeing all operational activities, even though decision-making can be centralized or decentralized, and the investment approach can be coordinated or free standing. Many are designed as all-weather investments, seeking to deliver absolute return and attractive risk-adjusted returns throughout almost any market environment. Some, less concerned about neutrality, seek to concentrate the best ideas into a mix of bottoms-up/top-down portfolio construction methodology. Others apply thematic tilts to the portfolio, trying to take advantage of investment trends, momentum or short-term market moves. Multi-PM platforms deploy capital across many multi-asset opportunities, including a wide variety of fundamental and quantitative strategies. They manage the risks generated by the underlying investment teams, relying on substantial investments in technology and expert teams of investment and IT professionals. 2. Broadly speaking, what are the potential advantages for the client of a Multi-PM platform over the traditional, single-manager hedge fund? Managers of traditional hedge funds are typically sophisticated specialists and gifted investors, employing any of almost three dozen strategies, as defined and classified by organizations such as Hedge Fund Research, Eurekahedge, or Preqin. Investors must not only select which hedge fund strategy is best for the prevailing environment, but also which manager is best positioned to execute the strategy. Consequently, single-manager funds tend to carry net exposures and trading betas associated with their particular strategy. More often they are amplified forms of the manager\u2019s investment views, leading to highly correlated ideas and holdings. In many cases, portfolio construction and risk management tend not to be as sophisticated as their core investment management expertise. A multi-manager platform offers a range of diversified alpha sources and centralizes the risk management function. The independent managers are thus free to put their talents to their highest and best use. The platform manager devotes a comparable level of expertise to managing risk, ensuring, for example, that all unwanted exposures are hedged and that the independent investment managers are within risk budget guidelines. Simply put, many Multi-PM funds consistently deliver their investment objective and target volatility. 3. Broadly speaking what are the potential disadvantages? Multi-PM platforms are operationally complex structures that demand a wide range of capabilities from the platform manager, which entails a high-level commitment of time, resources and expertise. The platform manager must be able to attract and retain multiple talented investment teams, allocate assets, and establish and enforce risk budgets. They must hedge the overall risk exposure of the independent managers and minimize the correlation of their performance. Multi-PMs must also manage high turnover rates while sourcing specialists and developing talent. Thus, investor due diligence of Multi-PMs must take into account skillsets and infrastructure that in many ways are markedly different from single-fund managers. The same is true when considering different Multi-PMs and assessing the likelihood of consistent alpha generation. Moreover, the due diligence task is sometimes hindered by inconsistent or obscure reporting, limited investment transparency, and fee opacity. 4. How many of these sophisticated specialist investors are there and how big is the universe? There are 8,000 hedge fund managers, according to Preqin, a leading provider of hedge fund intelligence, and in the same AIMA headcount study,2 it was estimated in North America that there are 78,500 hedge fund employees with an average number of 19.7 employees per fund manager. Estimated employees in Europe and Asia Pacific were 21,000 and 11,700, respectively. Typically hedge funds are evenly split between investment and non-investment professionals, suggesting 55,600 in the total hedge fund talent pool. However, this broad population represents all hedge fund strategies and not the narrower set the Multi-PM platforms employ. Focusing on just Multi-PMs, we believe there are roughly 9,500 investment professionals across more than 30 firms worldwide. Both the quantity and quality of trading talent have grown with the strategy. From 2008 to 2021, Multi-PMs expanded almost 50% faster than the industry3 and during this period more and more investment professionals learned to hone their skills, making them attractive to this style of investing. Right now the universe of trading talent has never been larger. \u00d7 Display 1: A Rising Tide \uf065 Source: eVestment. As of January 31, 2022. Note: Data rebased to 100.

What evidence is there that the Multi-PM structure has outperformed traditional single-manager hedge fund? For the 10 years ended April 30, 2022, a Multi-PM Peer Group Composite,4 comprised of 32 members, had an annual average return of 8.57% vs. 5.10% for traditional hedge funds, with about half the volatility (See Display 2). Even though this Multi-PM Peer Group Composite outperformed the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index by 3.47%, Multi-PMs, with their lower beta and tighter risk management, collectively generated more than 7.1% of annualized alpha when compared to the HFRI index, over the same period (See Display 3). \u00d7 Display 2: Multi-PM Platforms Have Delivered Stronger Risk-Adjusted Returns Than Hedge Funds \uf065 Source: MSIM AIP Hedge Fund Solutions.

What evidence is there that Multi-PMs are achieving a significant degree of market neutrality? A. Using the same 10 years ended April 30, 2022, the correlation of the Multi-PM Peer Group Composite to the S&amp;P 500 Index is 0.37 vs. HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index of 0.85. Market sensitivity, as measured in terms of beta to the S&amp;P 500 Index, is 0.08 vs. 0.38, respectively. Alternatively, and one of the more compelling ways to show market neutrality, is to view the results during some of the worst down-market periods. Looking at the aggregate (equal weighted average) returns of the Multi-PM Peer Group Composite, one can almost see a wave of positive and negative results, oscillating around zero (See Display 4). \u00d7 Display 4: Multi-Manager Platforms Have Held Up Well Through S&amp;P 500 Downturns \uf065 Source: MSIM AIP Hedge Fund Solutions.

Another straightforward way to assess market risk mitigation is to look at the average result when markets are down. Display 5 shows the average return of the Multi-PM Peer Group Composite during every period the S&amp;P 500 index was negative. This is sometimes called \u201cdownside capture.\u201d \u00d7 Display 5: On Average, Multi-Manager Platforms Gained During S&amp;P 500 Downturns \uf065 Source: MSIM AIP Hedge Fund Solutions.

Finally, a bit more technical, if you analyze each return of the Multi-PM Peer Group Composite relative to the market, distinguishing between up markets and down markets on the x-axis, you can see no discernible pattern. But a regression analysis reveals that during down markets (the red dots), the beta of the Multi-PM Peer Group Composite to the S&amp;P 500 is close to zero, with a modest upward slope (0.06). Similarly, during positive markets, (the green dots), the beta follows a similar upward slope (0.07). The level of market neutrality in both down and up markets can be denoted in the R-Squared statistic.5 In down markets the R-Squared is 7.4%and in up markets 5.7%, suggesting less than 10% of the market explains Multi-PM\u2019s returns (See Display 6). \u00d7 Display 6: Multi-PMs Have a Low R-Squared With the Market \uf065 Source: MSIM AIP Hedge Fund Solutions. As of April 30, 2022. \u00d7 Display 6: Multi-PMs Have a Low R-Squared With the Market Source: MSIM AIP Hedge Fund Solutions. As of April 30, 2022. 7. How is market neutrality integral to both portfolio construction and risk management? The goals of market neutrality and generating pure alpha are two sides of the same coin: Both seek to avoid or mitigate unwanted market risk. The two goals shape every aspect of a multi-manager platform, from the selection and onboarding of investment teams to the platform manager\u2019s intricate hedging protocols. Some of the more advanced platforms seek to manage and, through controlled processes, reinforce diversification. By actively monitoring and separating overlapping risks while concurrently engineering steps to promote low correlations, portfolio construction and risk management merge. Perhaps obvious, there are tried and true approaches that ensure tight risk management and low correlations and limit market exposures. CURATED DIVERSE UNIVERSES AND RISK GUIDELINES FOR PM TEAMS \u2014 Fundamental long/short equity managers are selected for their expertise within any of the major Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sectors or sub-sectors. The more selective platforms can partition the PM\u2019s trading universes and establish bespoke risk guidelines, whereas others can have multiple teams in the same sector and simply employ monolithic down-and-out risk management rules. Quant strategies are diversified across time horizons, with dollar volume and VaR limits. Many factors, such as the size and philosophy of the manager, the heterogeneity of industry risk, and the number of key return drivers, as well as the sector\u2019s native levels of active risk or total trading volumes, can influence how the platform manager decides on maintaining neutrality. MINIMIZATION OF INTER-MANAGER CORRELATION \u2014 The platform manager monitors potential overlaps among country/industry/style risk factors and seeks to identify and mitigate \u201ccrowded\u201d trades. Quant strategies, especially the ones with short horizons, tend to have low correlations to market risks and the ability to adapt quickly to rapidly changing trading environments. But surveillance without action tends to be a passive form of risk management. The more advanced platforms employ live oversight of risk budgets for the independent managers and provide real-time feedback to enhance risk management, and also reserve the right to exercise their at-the-touch liquidity, should it be needed. CENTRALIZED TRADING PORTFOLIOS AND RISK LIMIT ENFORCEMENT \u2014 Most platform managers construct a dedicated portfolio to hedge unwanted risk factors through overlays. Market and industry risks can be offset in blunt fashion with futures or sector ETFs whereas factor risk reduction can be accomplished by trading efficient baskets of stocks. For quant oversight, limits for each PM tend to be enforced based on target dollar volatility and volatility-based drawdown triggers. Limits on gross and net dollar exposure, and position concentration as a percent of trading levels, provide bright-line tests for the platform manager to enforce daily. The bottom line is that market neutrality ensures, to the greatest extent possible, that investors are paying only for active risk, not for beta or factor exposures that are easily\u2014and cheaply\u2014replicated in numerous other investments. 8. How does a platform manager ensure that expenses are minimized and that the firm\u2019s incentives are aligned with the investors\u2019? Multi-PMs fees are generally higher and involve variations on the classic hedge fund 2%/20% fee structure because of the two differing levels of management involved. One level of competitive compensation is required to attract and retain the underlying trading teams akin to the 2%/20% model. Additionally, the platform manager who oversees the entire infrastructure and operation, while managing the overall risk and fund administration is compensated. Good platform managers invest heavily in the business, personnel and technology. For investors, the payoff should be reflected in the after-fee performance of the Multi-PM, and we believe this value proposition is reflected in the Multi-PM track record (See Display 2). The complementary skills of the platform manager and the independent managers more than compensate for the total fees, and have generated more alpha, on average, than a single-manager fund. Platform managers can, and should, do everything possible to align incentives of their managers with investors, with some of the more innovative managers embedding performance hurdles in their fee structures. Such structures shift a portion of the fixed management fees to fees that are charged to investors only when earned by performance. We have seen newer entrants challenge the open-ended structure with some success. 9. What are the strengths to look for in a platform manager? To attract the best talent in a highly competitive environment, platform managers need to stand out as the \u201cpartner of choice\u201d for independent managers. We believe the most attractive platforms offer the independent manager\u2019s risk-taking autonomy combined with a strong franchise that has a global reach, backed by organizational stability and limited business risk. Investors need assurance that the platform manager views them as partners, investing alongside them, with a cost infrastructure optimized to maximize their return. In this context, \u201cfranchise strength\u201d means the willingness to negotiate competitive terms with independent managers, vendors and service providers for the benefit of investors. Investors deserve a partner that is a fiduciary committed to the highest standards and institutional responsibilities. This includes comprehensive reporting and providing enough transparency or access to key decision makers to understand not just how alpha is being generated, but why it is likely to persist. 10. Why are multi-manager platforms particularly timely in today\u2019s environment? Hedging unwanted market exposure has always been key to protecting alpha, but doing so has become more complicated and nuanced. For example, the impact of \u201crisk on/ risk off\u201d episodes in the pre-pandemic world usually was effectively hedged with the S&amp;P 500 Index, largely because factors like growth, momentum and value had reasonably consistent\u2014and predictable\u2014 performance during such periods. But the same has not held in a post- COVID environment. Investors have had to rapidly switch between the prospects of the economy opening up and shutting down, and the related impact on stocks from labor shortages, supply-chain dynamics and so forth. Such considerations have only increased with the U.S. Fed\u2019s withdrawal of liquidity and inflation-fighting rate increases amid the Russia/Ukraine conflict. Performance factors have undergone large shifts in direction and magnitude, and as a result, the S&amp;P 500 Index has become too blunt a tool for hedging. Factor exposures associated with hedge funds have been behaving very differently under the surface of daily market moves. This evolution of risk led to underperformance of many traditional hedge funds in 2021 and Q1 2022 compared with Multi-PM hedge funds, which are structurally better equipped to identify complicated changes in factor performance and keep hedging techniques up to date. \u00d7 Conclusion Multi-manager platforms share with traditional hedge funds the potential to generate alpha and a return profile that is uncorrelated with major asset classes or performance factors. But they also add a level of diversified alpha sources and sophisticated risk management that is difficult for many hedge funds to match. If this description fits your portfolio objectives, we believe multi-manager platforms deserve your consideration. \u00d7 1 Source: Bloomberg, \u201cAn Army of Faceless Suits is Taking Over the $4 Trillion Hedge Fund World,\u201d January 30, 2022, Nishant Kumar 2 Source: https://www.aima.org/educate/hedge-fund-industry-data.html.

{"content": "Major Developed Markets were down over the month, with the S&amp;P 500 (TR) (USD) once more faring the worst -8.3%, the MSCI Europe (TR) (EUR) next at -7.7% and MSCI Japan (TR) (JPY) -2.7% 1. Whilst the MSCI EM (USD) was -6.6%, a notable exception was the MSCI China (HKD), up 6.7%1. Despite being the strongest performer in previous months, at -14.2%, the MSCI Energy (USD) represented one of the worst performing sectors this month1. Though the US 10-Year Treasury yield moved above 3% during June, peaking at 3.5%2 , it was back to 3.01%1 by month end, on the back of deteriorating consumer data and growth indicators. \u00d7 We expect inflation to moderate slowly in the coming 12 months. Even if demand slows in response to high prices as we expect, some components of the CPI such as housing, may prove much stickier because of the lag between the index and rental prices. We expect food CPI to peak during Q3 2022. We remain concerned that a recession is becoming increasingly likely, given high inflation could force a quick pace of hikes in the US and Europe, meaning potentially excessive tightening, especially by the Federal Reserve, just as growth weakens. The end of June saw a number of data releases indicating US consumption is already in sharp decline. Consumer durables dropped in May -3.2% month-on-month3, real disposable income growth was down 0.1% month-on-month[2], and real spending growth at -0.4% month-on-month, was the first decline in real personal consumption expenditure since November 20214. So far, US forward sales and earnings estimates appear to have held up well, but this could turn. Ultimately central banks could end up shifting to a more benign stance in the latter part of 2022. Investment Implications We have kept our broad asset allocation stable, with low equities, having deployed our high cash position last month into fixed income. We made a number of tactical changes over the month, which we have outlined below: China A Equities We moved positive China A equities and are constructive, as the country comes out of lockdowns. The pace of recovery in consumption and private investment still appears muted. However, the economy is supported through increased public infrastructure spending, and easing measures for the residential property market. We expect fiscal stimulus to continue, combined with further cuts to rates and the bank\u2019s reserve requirement ratio (RRR), but at a controlled pace compared with past cycles, to avert fuelling asset bubbles. Valuations appear fair, with forward P/E ratios around 10Y median levels5. We believe Chinese equities should outperform relative to other regions. Indeed, sentiment is picking up, as YTD northbound flows have turned positive6. Global Energy Equities We increased our positive tilt to global energy. As mentioned, supply disruptions due to the Russia-Ukraine war should keep energy elevated and structural trends, such as energy companies\u2019 underinvestment in production and refining capacity, should further support. Based on past recessions, if we move towards a recessionary environment, we expect any hit to demand to be counterbalanced by supply disruptions in Russia and residual pent-up demand as the global economy concludes its reopening phase over the summer. Oil prices have generally been rising despite China lockdowns. However, with China now reopening, we believe that this and residual pent-up demand should offset any hit from slowing growth. Government Bonds Italian Government Bonds We moved underweight Italian government bonds (BTPs) and bought German Bunds and French government bonds (OATs), remaining neutral on the latter two. We view risks to BTP spreads skewed to the downside. The announcement that the European Central Bank (ECB) is designing an anti-fragmentation tool caused a significant tightening in spreads and should allow the ECB to hike rates quicker if needed, with less worry of causing another pickup in peripheral spread volatility. However, as the structure of the anti-fragmentation tool is worked out, we are likely to see some volatility in news flow just as the ECB is set to hike rates. This is still likely to put upward pressure on spreads, and we believe the ECB would allow for a gradual spread widening as a reflection of a tighter monetary stance, if this does not threaten the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Japanese Government Bonds We also moved negative Japanese government bonds (JGBs), adding instead to US Treasuries, as we expect JGBs to underperform relative to cash in the short term and the broader bond universe in the medium term. The Bank of Japan may be forced to relax its Yield Curve Control (YCC) and ultra-loose monetary policy, if inflation expectations and wage growth picks up.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser\u2019s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio\u2019s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio\u2019s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. \u00d7 Andrew Harmstone Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Manfred Hui Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Select Product(s) Right Click Edit", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/the-central-bank-conundrum-self-inflicted.html"}
{"content": "As investors seek to diversify their portfolio exposures beyond traditional assets, alternative lending may offer attractive absolute and risk-adjusted return characteristics. An allocation to alternative lending may provide investors with exposure to a secular shift in the way consumers and small businesses access capital. In this paper, we provide insights on this asset class and discuss why we view it as a through-the-cycle allocation for well-balanced portfolios. \u00d7 What Is Alternative Lending? Alternately referred to as marketplace lending, peer-to-peer lending and P2P lending, alternative lending takes place through online platforms that use technology to bring together borrowers underserved by traditional lending institutions, with loan investors seeking attractive yield-generating investments. The lending model grew out of small-balance, peer-to-peer unsecured consumer loans financed by individual investors. As the asset class matured, alternative lending evolved so that most loans are funded today by institutional investors, a group that counterintuitively includes even banks.1 Recognizing their technological and geographic constraints, community banks may focus on their core competency of deposit gathering while outsourcing credit underwriting and servicing to alternative lending platforms. Credit risks underwritten by alternative lenders have expanded over time, beyond the unsecured consumer, to include small businesses, autos, commercial and residential real estate, receivables, student loans and other forms of specialty finance. How Does it Work? Consumer borrowers may seek alternative loans for a variety of reasons, including for debt consolidation or to pay down revolving credit card balances. By moving from a revolving structure to an amortizing installment structure, consumer borrowers may benefit from a lower interest rate than would be charged on a comparable revolving balance, such as from a credit card. Alternative lending platforms seek to streamline the traditional lending process by bringing borrowers and loan investors together, and by using technology-enabled models to rapidly underwrite borrower credit risk when determining appropriate loan pricing, terms and amounts offered to borrowers. When borrowers accept loan offers, investors may purchase the loans post-issuance, for example, by actively selecting loans that they wish to purchase or by taking passive pro rata2 allocations of loans that meet prespecified criteria, considering loan type, size, term, duration, credit risk, geographic concentration, etc. Investors largely obtain the potential economic benefits and risks stemming from the loans, but the platforms typically maintain the customer relationship with end-borrowers and act as servicers for the loans, sending cash flows from the borrowers to the investors, net of servicing fees. The platforms also may charge loan origination fees, typically to the borrowers. Platforms may use partner banks to formally originate the loans they underwrite. The partner banks typically conduct oversight on the platforms\u2019 underwriting models and ensure that underwritten loans and servicing procedures comply with applicable laws. In some cases, the partner banks or platforms may maintain an economic interest in loans sold to investors. The loans themselves generally have relatively low initial balances, and terms of three to five years are typical. Today the most common consumer unsecured alternative loan is fully amortizing, with a weighted average term3 of roughly 3.5 years and an average balance of roughly $10,043.4 \u00d7 DISPLAY 1Alternative Lending Model \uf065 \u00d7 DISPLAY 1Alternative Lending Model The Evolution of Alternative Lending Alternative lending grew rapidly in the decade following the first peer-to-peer online loans underwritten in the U.K. in 2005 and in the U.S. in 2006, gathering pace in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis.5 These small-volume credit experiments leveraged marketplace models alongside technology-enabled customer acquisition, underwriting and loan servicing geared to borrowers who had grown comfortable with online services. Alternative lending volumes scaled as the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis drove bank retrenchment from consumer and small-business lending, and as new regulations increased the cost of capital for traditional banks, stressing the traditional banking model. To facilitate burgeoning loan volumes, alternative lending platforms evolved their funding models from the original peer-to-peer format to institutional buyers serving as the predominant loan investors, purchasing portfolios of loans in bulk. Hedge funds were early buyers, actively selecting individual loans that they expected would outperform the platforms\u2019 average underwriting. As the platform underwriting models matured and the opportunities for hedge fund alpha6 generation declined, institutional buyers largely migrated to passive pro rata purchases of loans within each buyer\u2019s defined credit box. Passive pro rata allocations moved the due diligence focus for loan purchasers from individual, small-balance loans to all the loans underwritten by a platform within a purchaser\u2019s defined credit box, as well as to the platforms themselves. Passive allocations also facilitated deeper integration with the capital markets. The first securitization backed by unsecured consumer alternative loans occurred in 2013, and the first rated securitization of those loans followed in 2015. U.S. consumer and small-business alternative lending platforms first listed their shares publicly in 2014. The first registered alternative lending fund launched in the U.S. in 2016. In 2021, Morgan Stanley Research estimated nearly $15.3 billion of asset-backed security issuance by the marketplace lending sector. Issuance increased materially as compared to FY 2020 volume of approximately $10 billion.7 YTD 2022 through April, asset-backed security issuance by the marketplace lending sector totaled approximately $3.7 billion, outpacing 2021 YTD issuance for the same time period.8 \u00d7 DISPLAY 2Evolution of Alternative Lending \uf065 * \u201cThe Hourglass Effect: A Decade of Displacement,\u201d QED Investors, Frank Rotman, April 13, 2015; AIP Alternative Lending Group research. ** AIP Alternative Lending Group.

June 1, 2022. Why Is the Opportunity Compelling Today? In our view, there are four main reasons why alternative lending may be a compelling strategy for investors: Alternative lending may provide a potential combination of attractive yield and low duration that stands in sharp contrast to the traditional fixed income universe. Alternative lending\u2019s relatively low duration may reduce sensitivity to changes in benchmark interest rates. One contributor to low duration is the amortizing structure typical of alternative loans, which may facilitate vintage diversification9 that may be challenging to achieve with traditional fixed income that only repays principal at maturity. Furthermore, alternative lending may offer outsized credit spreads,10 gross of any defaults and recoveries. While alternative loans often are unsecured, meaning, defaults typically will be higher and recoveries lower than with traditional fixed income, we believe that alternative lending\u2019s outsized credit spreads may provide a cushion against realized principal loss when investors encounter adverse economic environments, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or experienced during the Global Financial Crisis. Unsecured consumer alternative lending may be diversifying versus other major asset classes, including traditional corporate credit. Alternative lending\u2019s underlying credit exposure often stems from the consumer, rather than from corporate or government credit exposure that generally dominates traditional fixed income allocations. Unsecured consumer alternative lending exhibited fundamental resilience through the COVID crisis. In response to COVID-induced economic shutdowns, alternative lending platforms tightened credit standards, decreasing underwriting volumes and increasing borrower selectivity, and they increased borrower interest rates. They also offered short-term loan modification programs to impacted borrowers, which likely reduced borrower defaults as the economic backdrop stabilized. Alternative lending reflects a diversified opportunity set. Indeed, the volume and variety of strategies have flourished in recent years, providing multiple axes for diversification (e.g., by loan segment, credit quality, geography, security interest, balance size and/or loan duration). \u00d7 DISPLAY 3Diversified Opportunity Set \uf065 For illustrative purposes only.

The statements above reflect the opinions and views of AIP Alternative Lending Group as of the date hereof and not as of any future date, and will not be updated or supplemented. Conclusion While ramping inflation is negatively impacting U.S. consumer confidence, we believe that alternative lending\u2019s modest duration may limit direct interest rate sensitivity should the Fed continue to hike interest rates as significantly as market participants expect. As a primarily consumer-focused private credit opportunity, we believe that alternative lending can diversify investor\u2019s traditional and private corporate credit allocations. Alternative lending\u2019s yield, duration, and amortization characteristics continue to stand in stark contrast to most corporate debt. For these and other reasons, we believe that alternative lending can play an important role in investors\u2019 portfolios through the cycle. \u00d7 1 Source: AIP Alternative Lending Group.

{"content": "Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are liquid, publicly-traded companies that offer investors access to high-quality commercial real estate assets with strong growth potential and the unique benefits that come with investing in real assets. REITs own, operate, and develop traditional commercial properties like shopping centers, office buildings and apartment complexes, but also more specialty properties, such as cell towers, self-storage facilities and healthcare clinics. \u00d7 The listed real estate market evolves and grows with the broader needs of society and the economy\u2014and sits at the epicenter of how people live, work, shop and communicate. We believe there are several compelling reasons for investors to consider an allocation to REITs. REITs typically generate superior yields relative to other investments REITs have a history of producing attractive returns REITs provide diversification benefits in a portfolio of traditional equities and bonds REITs\u2019 inflation-hedging characteristics also make them a particularly attractive investment opportunity today. And for those investors focused on sustainability, certain REITs invest in real estate properties that are helping to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. What is a REIT? U.S. REITs are a tax structure that was formed through Congress in the 1960s as a means of making investing in high-quality commercial real estate accessible to all investors. Broadly, REITs are companies that own commercial real estate, collect rents on that real estate, and then pay that collected rent out in the form of dividends to shareholders. In the U.S., REITs are required to pay out at least 90% of their taxable income\u2014many pay out 100%. Listed real estate companies invest in familiar commercial properties including shopping centers and apartment complexes, as well as properties that are not necessarily top-of-mind, like storage facilities, data centers and cell phone towers. The modern REIT market is continuously evolving to meet the needs of the public and the necessity-based nature of these properties\u2014 facilitating commerce, providing shelter, and building the infrastructure of tomorrow\u2014providing insulation to earnings in a way that more discretionary investments cannot. Many other countries, including France, the U.K., Japan, Australia and Canada have also adopted REIT like structures, offering investors access to non U.S. real estate markets as well. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Real Estate Offers Some of the Highest Yields \uf065 Source: FactSet for Equity Index Dividend Yield; BlackRock Aladdin for Fixed Income Index Nominal Yield; Bloomberg for 10 Year U.S. Treasury Yield.

The Case for REITs We believe there are several good reasons to invest in REITs: YIELD: Low absolute interest rates continue to add fuel to investors\u2019 search for yield. U.S. and global real estate pay a high yield relative to investable alternatives. In fact, real estate offers some of the highest yields, second only to global high-yield bonds. TOTAL RETURN: Beyond yield, REITs can provide an attractive source of total return.

INFLATION HEDGE: REITS HAVE HISTORICALLY PERFORMED WELL IN INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENTS \u2013 Inflation is in the headlines and has become a discernable part of everyday life, with price increases evident at the gas station, grocery store and travel related industries, amongst others. Many businesses\u2014and their stock prices\u2014continue to suffer from increases in the cost of raw materials and wages, especially those businesses where it is difficult to pass on price increases to end consumers. REITs, on the other hand, have some real advantages in inflationary environments. As prices rise, property values tend to appreciate, while cash flow streams also generally benefit. For example, properties with short-term leases, such as hotels, self-storage facilities and apartments, are reset frequently. Landlords then have the ability to adjust rents quickly in reaction to inflationary pressures. Additionally, for those property types with longer-duration leases, such as retail, office and logistics, the investment can often offer inflation protection that is specifically built into the lease (e.g. explicit inflation linked increases). Display 4 shows that REITs have historically posted positive returns in most inflationary environments, to the point where many investors consider real estate a compelling hedge against inflation. \u00d7 DISPLAY 4: REITs Have Historically Done Well in Inflationary Environments \uf065 Source: Sources: Bloomberg Economic Data, Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

Real Estate and \u201cWork-From-Home\u201d \u2013 Some Interesting Opportunities The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated and introduced new market dynamics, creating significant and, in many cases, surprising dispersions\u2014and opportunities\u2014for active managers within listed real estate investing. One of the most disruptive impacts the Covid-19 pandemic has had on commercial real estate has been to the office sector. Over the course of the pandemic, work-from-home and hybrid work became the norm, and while the number of Covid cases has dropped globally, a return to office hasn\u2019t increased correspondingly. However, the impact of the return to office has varied significantly city-by-city and country-by-country. Additionally, an increased focus on health, wellness and safety is reversing densification trends witnessed over the past decades and serving as a partial offset to the demand impairment stemming from hybrid work. We are increasingly more constructive on office over the short to intermediate term in light of return to office trends. While the office industry is facing headwinds from lingering secular and cyclical forces, we expect certain secular challenges\u2014specifically, densification trends from shrinking square foot per employee, to reverse; while other challenges\u2014high sustaining capex\u2014will persist. Real Estate and e-Commerce \u2013 \u201cBricks and Mortar\u201d Is Not Dead In the retail real estate world, the explosive growth in e-commerce had shifted demand away from \u201cbricks and mortar\u201d storefronts to warehouses, data centers and logistics. However, coming out of the pandemic, there is now a renewed appreciation for the storefront as retailers rethink the role of the physical store in distribution and, in some cases, brand development. There will likely continue to be square footage rationalization as e-commerce grows, but brick-and-mortar retail will not disappear. The pandemic has underscored the importance of a physical location in a true omnichannel distribution environment and retailers are reinvesting in their stores and looking to sign leases in premium retail centers globally. Sustainability \u2013 How REITs Can Make a Difference Businesses, governments and investors are committing to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. This has significant implications for global real estate. According to the United Nations Environment Program, building operations and construction represent 39% of global greenhouse gas emissions. It estimates that direct building carbon emissions will need to be cut in half by 2030 to get on track for 2050, having major implications for real estate landlords, developers and property values. As an investor focused on responsible investing, understanding the key risks and opportunities faced by commercial real estate landlords looking to cut global emissions is top of our mind and fully integrated into our research and investment process. \u00d7 In Summary We believe there are several compelling reasons to invest in listed real estate over a market cycle, and more importantly, now. These include: Attractive yield potential relative to other investments Ability to generate a compelling total return Portfolio diversification Proven potential to perform well in inflationary environments Enhanced environmental, social and governance investment opportunities \u00d7 RISK WARNING There are special risk considerations associated with investing in the real estate industry securities such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and the securities of companies principally engaged in the real estate industry. These risks include: the cyclical nature of real estate values, risks related to general and local economic conditions, overbuilding and increased competition, increases in property taxes and operating expenses, demographic trends and variations in rental income, changes in zoning laws, casualty or condemnation losses, environmental risks, regulatory limitations on rents, changes in neighborhood values, related party risks, changes in the appeal of properties to tenants, increases in interest rates and other real estate capital market influences. Generally, increases in interest rates will increase the costs of obtaining financing, which could directly and indirectly decrease the value of a strategy investing in the Real Estate Industry. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. \u00d7 Laurel Durkay Head of Global Listed Real Assets Global Listed Real Assets Team", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/why-reits-and-why-now.html"}

{"content": "Watching crowds of young men and women masquerading in anime and Hollywood superhero costumes, visitors to Riyadh in March might have forgotten they were in Saudi Arabia. At a time of high oil prices in the aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the Kingdom nears the halfway stage in an ambitious program devised by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a program enacting social and economic reforms designed to wean the economy off its dependence on the oil sector. Foreign investors have poured $9 billion into the Saudi equity market in the first quarter of 2022, exceeding the approximately $7 billion during 2021.1 \u00d7 The economy grew 9.6% in the first quarter of 2022, the highest growth rate since 2011, driven by a 20% increase in oil sector contributions.2 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates the Saudi economy will expand 7.6% this year, more than double the 3.2% growth recorded in 2021 and for the first time in Saudi Arabia\u2019s history the IMF estimates the GDP to exceed $1 trillion in 2022.3 To be fair, oil prices were already climbing as post-COVID demand returned before the shock of Russia\u2019s invasion propelled prices to levels not seen for around a decade. And as the world\u2019s top oil exporter, Saudi Arabia has benefited from the price hikes. There is a mood of optimism in the Saudi air. Consumer confidence indicators are at all-time highs, where a recent Ipsos survey found that 92% of Saudi respondents thought the country was going in the right direction,4 an overwhelming vote of trust after the Kingdom survived the twin shock of the pandemic and drop in oil demand and prices. Back in 2019, we marveled at the pace of social reforms (\u201cThe New Saudi Arabia\u201d), designed to make the country a more attractive place for its own citizens, especially the under 35s who make up more than 50% of the 35 million population,5 and help draw tourists. But we also wondered if the government could seriously make progress to create an economy that was not so reliant on oil sector growth. The fast pace of social reforms has continued. Women are now allowed to drive and work in fields previously only limited to men. In fact, more than 33% of Saudi women now participate in the labor force, a significant surge since 2018.6 Restaurants are no longer required to have partitions separating single men from families and in 2018, for the first time in more than 35 years, commercial cinemas are allowed to operate in the country. In addition, Saudi Arabia has joined the select list of countries hosting a Formula 1 Grand Prix race and entertainers ranging from WWE wrestling stars to Cuban-American rapper Pitbull and Canadian popstar Justin Bieber have performed in front of hundreds of thousands of fans. Oil remains central to the Saudi economy although economic and fiscal reforms have started to show results (Display 1). The country is still reliant on government spending and remains tied to oil price gyrations. Riyadh posted a budget surplus of $15.3 billion in the first three months of 2022, its first surplus in nearly 10 years, after a deficit of 2.7% of GDP last year.7 This surplus accounts for 64% of the projected $24 billion or 2.5% of GDP Riyadh had forecast for this year.8 \u00d7 Display 1: Saudi Arabia Is Less Reliant on Oil Revenues Oil vs non-oil government revenues, pre and post launch Vision 2030 \uf065 Source: MSIM, Haver, Saudi Ministry of Finance, Argaam \u00d7 Display 1: Saudi Arabia Is Less Reliant on Oil Revenues Oil vs non-oil government revenues, pre and post launch Vision 2030 Source: MSIM, Haver, Saudi Ministry of Finance, Argaam Inflation is rising in much of the world to levels not seen for years, but in Saudi Arabia it\u2019s relatively subdued. In fact, the Kingdom has lower inflation than most countries globally and in the emerging markets.9 There are issues though. While the official April CPI was 2.3%, prices on many basic food categories appear to be well over 10%.10 We believe the government has the tools to control inflation, such as reducing the 15% VAT rate or offering citizens cost-of-living allowances to counteract rising food inflation. While we are not sure a demand subsidy will counteract food inflation, both a VAT reduction and cost-of-living allowances should theoretically support Saudi consumption. To move beyond oil, the government is banking on Vision 2030, a plan unveiled by Crown Prince Mohammed in 2016 to restructure the economy and develop tourism and entertainment projects. The government sees tourism as a key element of their reform plan and the single largest source of new jobs. Currently, a huge number of Saudis leave the Kingdom for holidays, spending around $24 billion a year elsewhere.11 If some of that money can be spent locally, that would provide a huge boost to the economy. Critics argue that the progress has been slow in some areas, but things are clearly moving in the right direction. The Public Investment Fund (PIF), the main Saudi sovereign-wealth fund, has invested in a series of mega-projects to develop parts of Riyadh and build new cities and resorts by the Red Sea to boost non-religious tourism. It\u2019s a remarkable change in attitude given that Saudi Arabia didn\u2019t even issue tourist visas until 2019 but these days international travelers can procure an e-visa with a few simple clicks. The most ambitious project is Neom, a $500 billion vision of a new city that aspires to be a luxury resort as well as an innovation hub focused on \u201cindustries of the future.\u201d By the end of 2025, Neom anticipates as many as a million visitors arriving for a holiday or a business event - the first hotel is expected to open by the end of 2022. Management expects Neom\u2019s international airport to be operational by 2025 with a capacity of 25 million passengers per year. Beyond tourism, Neom inked a $5 billion green hydrogen plant to come online in 2025, for its first major industrial project. The green projects are part of the plans by the Kingdom to invest $180 billion to cut its carbon emissions to net zero by 2060. The private sector is also starting to do its part as five Saudi corporations, including both the world\u2019s largest oil producer and national airline, have joined the MENA region\u2019s first voluntary carbon market, backed by PIF. North of Jeddah, the Red Sea Tourism Project has secured funding and construction loans. The first phase of the two-phase project includes developing five islands, 16 hotels (including 14 marine resorts) with a total capacity of 3,100 rooms and two resorts, in addition to two yacht marinas, entertainment facilities and an airport. The aim is to host the first guests sometime next year and to complete the project by 2030. Risks to projects are long construction lead times and possible capacity bottlenecks in the contractor sector. One area of focus that has slowed recently is foreign direct investment (FDI), where the global macro backdrop was not supportive due to COVID and low oil prices. The Kingdom had hoped to attract $10 billion in annual inflows but only managed $5.5 billion in 2020.12 Last year, the government announced new plans to attract $100 billion in annual FDI by 2030. Shareek (which means partner) is another prong of the economic reform, designed to drive investments to domestic businesses. Under Shareek, private companies invest a percentage of their profits in local investments, where the goal is to raise the private sector\u2019s share of GDP from 40 percent to 65 percent by 2030. Saudi Arabia still has a lot of work to do to fully achieve the ambitious goals of Vision 2030 and diversify away from oil. The high oil price will ease the pain of the economic reforms that are needed. The targets are ambitious but with strong leadership and a young and educated population a lot can be achieved. \u00d7 DOWNLOAD TALES FROM THE EMERGING WORLD .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:fit-content; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective.

Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Stocks of small-capitalization companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets, and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more-established companies. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the Portfolio\u2019s performance. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Cryptocurrency (notably, Bitcoin) operates as a decentralized, peer-to-peer financial exchange and value storage that is used like money. It is not backed by any government. Federal, state or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency may experience very high volatility. \u00d7 1 Morgan Stanley Research, Bloomberg, Tadawul.

{"content": "Economist Pippa Malmgren has been credited for coining the term \u201cshrinkflation\u201d, meaning, in its most common usage, when a company reduces a product\u2019s size while maintaining its price. A less common usage of this term may refer to the pertinent macroeconomic situation where the economy is contracting while also experiencing a rising price level, perhaps better known as stagflation. Against a backdrop of rising rates and inflation, markets are shrinking too, in stark contrast to the cost of living. March U.S. consumer price index data took the annual rate of inflation to 8.5%, its highest since December 1981. \u00d7 \" Shrinkflation is an increasingly common response by companies to inflation \u2013 fewer sheets per roll, fewer caplets per bottle, fewer washes per box Inflation so far has been driven by \u201cstuff\u201d, as there has been a shortage of goods and commodities as economies have bounced back fast from the COVID-19 crisis, given the combination of massive government support and the vaccine miracle, in developed markets at least. This has then been aggravated by further supply shocks in food and energy, owing to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and may be made worse still if COVID-19 shutdowns affect Chinese production. The question from here is whether the inflation leaks from \u201cstuff\u201d to \u201cstaff\u201d, with rising wage settlements in a tight labour market, and jobs easy to find and hard to fill. U.S. wage growth has accelerated to 5%,1 the highest seen so far this century, though still behind the consumer inflation rate, implying falling real wages. Ultimately, there is a bit of a Catch-22 for companies \u2014 either wages rise, potentially squeezing corporates\u2019 margins; or they don\u2019t, threatening real wage falls that could hurt consumption and thus corporates\u2019 top-line sales. Shrinkflation is an increasingly common response by companies to inflation \u2014 fewer sheets per roll, fewer caplets per bottle, fewer washes per box. Brands quietly downsize their products without decreasing prices accordingly, to maintain or boost profits as they try to navigate increases in the cost of materials, labour, energy, packaging and transport, or to maintain market share in the face of stiffer competition for every dollar. The service sector is not immune, with hotel chains making guests opt in to daily room cleaning and not rushing to restore breakfast service post-pandemic. Customers are typically more sensitive to price over contents, and \u201cimproved\u201d formulations in a rebranded or repackaged (read smaller) bag are perceived less negatively or barely noticed. However, companies need to be careful of consumer backlash and cannot afford to shrink their products repeatedly or they risk losing consumer trust. In fact, in a world of social media and an emphasis on integrity, shrinkflating companies in 2022 are more likely to need to explain their downsized offerings. So far, company earnings forecasts are proving largely immune to these fears. MSCI World Index 12-month forward earnings estimates are up 6%2 so far this year, as companies enjoy the inflationary impact on revenues without taking margin pain \u2026 yet. Indeed, EBIT3 margins remain at extremely elevated levels, approaching 17% for the MSCI World Index, versus the pre-pandemic peak of 15% and the 20-year average of 13.4%.2 These stretched margins have to be under threat, either from the inflation itself or any slowdown caused by the attempts to tackle the inflation. One key to navigating this environment as an investor is to focus on companies with robust fundamentals that enjoy pricing power \u2014 the ability to pass on input costs, be they stuff or staff \u2014 to consumers. Staples companies that sell essential products can even increase prices in this tough environment. For example, a multinational consumer hygiene company we hold reported that its strong portfolio of brands has allowed for \u201cresponsible price action\u201d, i.e. an increase in pricing of 5% in the first quarter across its business, while a Dutch brewing company we own managed double-digit \u201cprice mix\u201d in the first quarter, as it passed on costs, helped by the return to bars and restaurants in Europe. This contrasts with the fortunes of general retailers (which we don\u2019t own), which have suffered the mistake of increasing their inventory of home equipment at a time when a post-pandemic consumer is shifting towards leisure and services outside the home. Mission-critical software-on-subscription models also enjoy fortress-like pricing power and recurring revenues, as an American technology company proved with its announced price increases for commercial products that took effect 1 March 2022. Typically, such announcements are softened with reference to innovative improvements, for example new artificial intelligence tools or enhanced security being included in the price. Payments companies, which take a clip of every dollar in a rising inflation environment, gaining revenue without having to increase prices, are often overlooked inflation plays \u2014 never mind that they have been able to effect increases in merchant fees. Within medtech and life sciences, product mix matters, and in some categories like nutrition, it is easier to effect price increases than in more commoditized areas. Medical and scientific supplies companies enjoy some protection, as hospitals and scientists will continue to prize reliability and quality, raising switching costs. This is particularly the case where the products and services provided are a small part of the customers\u2019 cost base. We started the year very worried about both earnings and multiples. Five months of derating has eased our fears on multiples, though they are not in any way low, as they are still at the top end of their 2003-2019 range \u2014 but at least they are no longer a scary 20% above that range. By contrast, our concerns about earnings have continued to rise, along with the earnings themselves, aggravated by the growing risks to the stretched margins from either inflation or a downturn. Given the risks to earnings, it may be a particularly good time to own compounders, i.e. companies that can grow their earnings steadily across cycles because their pricing power and recurring revenue make their earnings resilient in tough times. \u00d7 1 Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index, March 2022 2 Source: FactSet 3 Earnings before interest and taxation \u00d7 Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective.

Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments.

Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy\u2019s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 Bruno Paulson Managing Director International Equity Team Laura Bottega COO and Head of Client Experience, International Equity Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/shrinkflation.html"}
{"content": "Containing Inflation The Fed cannot lower inflation and keep it contained within its 2 - 2.5% target all by itself. What is required is coordination between both monetary and fiscal policy in order to sustainably rein in significant inflation risks. These were the tools used to lower and contain inflation in the 1980s and are again necessary to lower inflation to target levels and, most importantly, keep it there. \u00d7 Supply AND Demand The narrative forwarded today is that the Fed needs to cure the inflation infirmity only through monetary policy, much like the former Fed Chair Paul Volcker did in the 1980s. However, this narrative is only a half-truth because, similar to the 1980s, today\u2019s inflation is being driven by a supply shock as well as an increase in demand. This means that a supply-side response supported by fiscal policy is needed in addition to a monetary policy response, which only serves to decrease demand by increasing the cost of money and credit. It is understood now that the shortages in goods and labor that brought about higher prices and wages were not transitory, but instead resulted in a wage-price spiral that has created persistent inflation risks. These shortages need to be addressed by fiscal policy, namely government spending, regulation and taxation, all designed to increase the productive capacity of the U.S. economy such that supply meets demand. If the Fed relies on raising interest rates alone, it may only succeed at deflating asset valuations. The focus on monetary policy alone might also create a recession, but inflation may remain sticky and bounce even higher once the economy recovers. It is imperative that productive capacity is increased requiring a supply-side policy response. A Lesson From the Volcker Era A common misunderstanding is that aggressive rate hikes by Volcker in the 1980s solved the inflation problem, period. However, a broader and more correct account would indicate that Volcker\u2019s policies created not one, but two, back-to-back and very deep recessions that merely served to \u201cinterrupt\u201d the rise in inflation. His actions would not have completely eliminated inflation without corresponding supply-side fiscal policies. Fiscal Policy Is a Must That\u2019s what\u2019s missing today. We need to see a plan for a fiscal policy to work in coordination with monetary policy. Supply and demand need to work together to bring down inflation more permanently. If the Fed goes it alone, then it will be using only a demand tool to fix a supply problem. Unless we see coordinated fiscal and monetary policy, inflation may stick around longer than market consensus suggests. \u00d7 RISK CONSIDERATIONS. There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. High-yield securities (\u201cjunk bonds\u201d) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks.

As active managers running concentrated portfolios and with a long-term investment horizon, we believe we are well positioned to engage with management on material ESG topics and influence companies towards better practices. \u00d7 We seek to deliver better outcomes for our clients through producing attractive returns over the long term. To do this, we must invest with a conscious eye on whether companies can deliver better outcomes not just today, but 5, 10, and even 20 years from now. We back companies that have the characteristics needed to lead in the long run, like recurring revenue, pricing power and strong management, and importantly also invest to manage and improve their ESG impact. Direct, portfolio manager-led engagement is, in our view, vital to understanding whether companies and management can deliver in these areas.

Environmental topics featured in 71% of our ESG engagements, while social and governance topics presented in 54% and 45% of engagements respectively. \u00d7 Display 1Number of engagement where we discussed ESG-related topics, FY 2021 2, 3 \uf065 \u00d7 Display 1Number of engagement where we discussed ESG-related topics, FY 2021 2, 3 1 Read our January 2022 Global Equity Observer, Climate Change: Everyone\u2019s Business for more information on our carbon transition engagement programme. 2 Data shown is for the 12-month period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021. 3 Total count of ESG topics discussed is higher than total number of ESG engagements as more than one topic may be discussed in a meeting. \u00d7 Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:45%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy\u2019s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 Marte Borhaug Head of Sustainable Outcomes International Equity Team Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/engage-spring-2022.html"}
{"content": "The US led the rebound in risk assets during the last week of May. However, most markets ended the month flat. The S&amp;P 500 returned 0.2% (USD), the MSCI Europe was down 0.6% (EUR) and MSCI Japan paused its downward trajectory of previous months, ending May up 0.9% (JPY)1 . The MSCI Emerging Markets Index returned 0.5%1. Energy continued to be the clear sector outperformer with the MSCI ACWI Energy index up 12.2%, on the back of slowly rising oil prices1. The US 10-Year Treasury yield appears to have finally settled, ending the month a fraction lower than in April, at 2.8% . The VIX moved down to end the month at 262. \u00d7 The fall in the S&amp;P 500 at the beginning of the month appeared mostly driven by multiple compression. Despite a bounce in the final week, we still believe though this is likely a bear market rally, due to increasing signs of deteriorating consumer confidence and slowing growth. We finally saw the correlation between equities and fixed income turn negative. Should equities fall, investors at least now may have somewhere to hide. Now that the correlation appears to have been restored, we are increasingly comfortable with fixed income and believe the decline in yields should stabilise. With tentative signs that inflation is plateauing, as we progress through the late stages of the cycle, we believe US investment grade credit should outperform high yield credit and equities, especially if recession risks rise. That said, we do not anticipate a US recession until 2H 2023. Investment Implications We have been keeping our powder dry, so we can move cash back into markets at opportune moments. We are already seeing opportunities in the fixed income space. In May we maintained our allocation to equities, but deployed cash to increase duration risk by allocating broadly to fixed income. Before the last week of the month, we increased equity exposure via futures, as options deltas had dropped. This is consistent with the team\u2019s view that the market may be oversold in the near term. The subsequent rally in equities in the last week of May indicated our view was correct. We have made the following tactical changes over May. The implementation of these is dependent on portfolio guidelines and some portfolios may not permit: High Dividend, Low Volatility Equities We added an overweight to high dividend, low volatility equities, through an ETF. This offers an attractive dividend yield from US equities, plus exposure to defensive and value sectors, which continue to trade at a discount to growth. The relatively low volatility and beta characteristics should mitigate the downside, in the event of further volatility. US Equities Enhanced Value We removed our position in an ETF and moved to Russell 1000 Value futures to take exposure to the value sector more broadly and make room for more focused allocations to other ETFs or mutual funds, for portfolios which have an allocation restriction. Brazilian equities We moved from overweight to neutral Brazilian equities. We had moved overweight in April, but the investment case is weakening. Terms of trade have likely peaked in the short term, while prospects for two key exports have deteriorated; soybean prices could come under pressure from higher global supply in 2022/23, while China\u2019s continued zero-Covid policy is likely to hit iron ore demand. Commodities We have increased total exposure to commodities, for portfolios which permit, while changing their composition. Within this we have reduced gold, and added a position in an agriculture fund ETF, to gain exposure to agricultural commodity futures. We aim to hedge upside risks to agricultural commodity prices, due to supply disruptions from the conflict in the Ukraine, which is leading to growing food protectionism and rising input costs such as fertiliser, all of which pushes food prices higher. Emerging Market Local Debt We moved from overweight to neutral emerging market short-duration commodity-exporter high-yielder countries, implemented through a bond securities basket. Both the key drivers, real yield and terms of trade have deteriorated since we put on the position. US 10-year Treasuries We have removed the US 10-year Treasuries underweight. Inflation risks are more balanced, given tentative signs of stabilising wage growth, especially as the global growth outlook dims. Expectations of 50bps Fed hikes in the near term, with several 25bps hikes thereafter, are priced in, leaving little room for a hawkish surprise. Investment Grade Corporates We removed our US Investment Grade Corporates underweight and moved to neutral. After recent rates and spreads adjustments, risk-reward in future forward is more balanced as monetary tightening is largely priced in and we see tentative signs of sequential inflation plateauing. Even if recession risks are rising, our analysis suggests higher spreads can be offset by lower rates, leaving an attractive yield. At the same time, we maintained our underweight in European Investment Grade Corporates, as high duration of Investment Grade and compressed spreads are likely to result in poor total returns when yields/spreads rise.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser\u2019s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio\u2019s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio\u2019s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. \u00d7 Andrew Harmstone Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Manfred Hui Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Select Product(s) Right Click Edit", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/navigating-changing-correlations.html"}
{"content": "As the world gears up to tackle global warming, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydro power are at the forefront of solutions offered to avert a climate catastrophe. Yet a case needs to be made to include nuclear power in the mix of tools to fight climate change. Given the challenges in quickly expanding renewable energy sources like solar, and increased geopolitical concerns around energy independence, policy makers are finally waking up to the promise of nuclear power. \u00d7 French president Emmanuel Macron recently announced a \u20ac1 billion package of funding in support of small nuclear reactors and pledged to construct 14 new generation reactors.1,2 Newly elected South Korean President Yoon Sukyeol is aiming for nuclear to account for 30% of total power generation, a reversal in policy from the previous president.3 Japan, home to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, recently restarted nuclear capacity.4 China intends to build more nuclear reactors over the next 15 years\u2014150 in total\u2014more than the rest of the world combined has built over the last 35 years.5 Yet, a rebranding of this \u201celemental\u201d power is needed to overcome legacy perceptions. Nuclear is carbon free, more reliable than other renewables, and possesses a strong safety track record, on par with solar and wind energy. Nuclear energy produces zero direct carbon or GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions. In fact, nuclear has lower GHG emissions than solar and wind when including indirect emissions over its lifecycle. Over the past 50 years, nuclear power has reduced CO2 emissions by more than 60 gigatons, which is almost two years\u2019 worth of global emissions.6 Nuclear has a proven track record for historic decarbonization: three of the five fastest declines in the carbon intensity of energy occurred in countries that embraced nuclear power (Display 1). \u00d7 Display 1 Nuclear Can Drastically Alter a Carbon FootprintFive fastest declines in energy intensity of carbon \uf065 Source: The Breakthrough Institute, December 17, 2018. \u00d7 Display 1 Nuclear Can Drastically Alter a Carbon FootprintFive fastest declines in energy intensity of carbon Source: The Breakthrough Institute, December 17, 2018. The global energy system requires redundancy and reliability that is hard to achieve with renewables alone. Solar, wind and hydro depend on weather conditions and seasonal cycles that limit consistent use. While battery technology is improving, wind and solar are not reliable \u201cbaseload\u201d energy sources. Nuclear power is currently the only carbon-free energy source that can reliably deliver electricity, day or night, 24/7, to critical service providers like hospitals or data centers, more so than any other energy sources including solar, wind and natural gas.7 Arguably the biggest misconception about nuclear power is safety. High-profile accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima have amplified long-standing fears around nuclear. Yet deaths resulting from nuclear energy are 99% lower than deaths from coal and 97% lower than deaths from gas.8 Radiation exposure from Chernobyl, the worst nuclear accident in history, caused an estimated 4,000 premature deaths, according to the United Nations.9 While this is an unthinkable tragedy, researchers have estimated that as many as 4.5 million people died in a single year (2019) from exposure to air pollution caused by fossil fuels.10 What then explains the general public\u2019s fear of nuclear power? To start, nuclear accidents seem to have been seared into the public consciousness. In nearly every case that a country has shut down nuclear power plants, \u201cdirty\u201d power has replaced carbon-free electricity.11 Nuclear waste is a serious concern, but 90% of nuclear waste is \u201clow-level\u201d and only 1% radioactive.12 Three percent of the waste is considered \u201chigh-level,\u201d but contrary to popular belief, it is dense and relatively small: by some estimates, the nuclear fuel waste generated in the United States over the past 60 years would \u201cfit on a football field, stacked 20 feet high.\u201d13 Many experts argue that the high cost of nuclear power plants is a function of decades of bureaucracy and bad policies. It\u2019s hard to imagine but since 1975, with regulatory red tape slowing the licensing process, no new nuclear plant has ever reached operation.14 Furthermore, renewables other than nuclear receive far more generous subsidies and tax breaks. For example, in 2018, nuclear received a mere $13 million in federal tax incentives per unit of energy produced, while wind received over $2 billion and solar over $3.3 billion.15 Emerging market countries, including China, South Korea and India, have demonstrated a willingness to embrace nuclear energy (Display 2). \u00d7 Display 2 Emerging Markets Leads New Nuclear Capacity AdditionsTotal under construction reactor net capacity (in thousands MWe) \uf065 Source: \u201cWorld Nuclear Performance Report 2021\u201d \u00d7 Display 2 Emerging Markets Leads New Nuclear Capacity AdditionsTotal under construction reactor net capacity (in thousands MWe) Source: \u201cWorld Nuclear Performance Report 2021\u201d China is the world\u2019s new champion for nuclear energy. President Xi Jinping considers nuclear as a key part of the \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d strategy, designed to bolster high-tech industries. China also announced the construction of the world\u2019s first commercial small modular reactor in South China\u2019s Hainan Province. After completion, the reactor will have an annual power generation capacity of 1 billion-kilowatt-hours, meeting the energy demands of 526,000 homes.16 Given the challenges of achieving \u201cnet zero\u201d through our current global energy mix, we expect nuclear to become a more favored alternative and play a key role in a coordinated global energy transition. We also believe nuclear power can play a role in helping developing countries achieve energy security without the need to rely on fossil fuels. Several hurdles remain including safety, cost and public support. But just as COVID led to seismic changes in how we work, climate concerns and geopolitical events will revive support for nuclear power: a safe, reliable and carbon-free source of energy. \u00d7 DOWNLOAD TALES FROM THE EMERGING WORLD .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:fit-content; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective.

{"content": "Inflation has emerged as the central macro issue over the past two of years. As most major central banks tighten policy, inflation trajectory will remain key to assessing the likely macro and market outcomes. In this note, we discuss three scenarios for inflation and monetary policy and assess market implications of each. While the dreaded recession scenario is a possibility, we do not see it as the dominant scenario. Higher sustained inflation in the context of slower but resilient economic growth appears to be the more likely one over the next 12-18 months, with mildly negative real returns for major asset classes. Beyond near-term considerations, recent geopolitical developments are likely to lead to accelerated decarbonization, fragmentation of supply chains and looser fiscal policies which raises the probability of inflation remaining higher on a secular basis.

{"content": "Markets continue to be buffeted by high levels of volatility driven by shifting fears of recession and inflation. This roller coaster of a month resulted in very diverse financial market performance. In the U.S., the month started off where April ended: higher yields, wider credit spreads, weaker equities as inflation fed tightening fears dominated. But by mid-month, slowdown fears (growth surprises became negative) increased, which pushed yields lower across U.S. Treasuries, reduced rate hike expectations by about 25 basis points (bps) and helped equities rebound. By the end of May, U.S. Treasury 10-year yields were down about 9 bps and the S&amp;P 500 equity index essentially unchanged, after being down almost 6% mid-month. With a more dovish U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) outlook (on the back of growth fears) the U.S. yield curve steepened. \u00d7 Price action in the rest of the world\u2019s bond markets was not so benign. Yields in Europe rose significantly with German 10-year yields up 18 bps. It was quite noticeable that in countries where monetary policy hawkishness weakened to some degree, bond markets did OK; but in those countries where central bank hawkishness was maintained or intensified, bond yields continued to rise over the month. Inflation data continue to show little signs of slowing sufficiently for central banks to relent on hiking plans. Fed rhetoric remains one of \u201cexpeditiously\u201d getting rates normalized while, for example, European Central Bank (ECB) members continue to harp on the need to quickly exit negative interest rate policy. As such, May was unusual in that U.S. rate expectations softened (taking out one anticipated rate hike) relative to those in the rest of the world. The Bank of Canada was particularly forceful in its comments about the need to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to get inflation down sooner rather than later. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date \uf065 Note: USD-based performance.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. See below for index definitions. Perceptions that inflation had peaked, economies were slowing, and the Fed was unlikely to raise rates by more than priced into yield curves gave a fillip to markets, especially once U.S. Treasury yields moved over 3% on May 5, a level perceived to be a bridge too far (for the health of the economy). The mid May rally in U.S. yields was somewhat anomalous, suggesting it is unlikely to continue. During the month, real yields rose as nominal yields fell, implying a decline in inflation expectations. Nominal and real yields are usually highly positively correlated. It is also counterintuitive given the upward pressure seen in commodity prices (particularly oil and food) to think inflation expectations should improve so significantly. As such, we were not surprised that the rally in 10- year U.S. Treasuries ran out of steam around the 2.75% level. These relative central bank assessments drove fixed income returns. U.S. Treasuries and U.S. dollar bonds eked out positive returns for the month, while in general, fixed income returns were negative outside the U.S. High yield corporates continued to sell off, not benefiting as much from an easing of Fed hawkishness. Indeed, while anticipating lower short rates is good for bonds, higher real yields and lower inflation is not for lower quality issuers. Euro-denominated corporate bonds (both IG and HY) put in a very poor performance on the back of increased ECB hawkishness, higher yields and poor inflation data. \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: Currency Monthly Changes Versus U.S. Dollar \uf065 Note: Positive change means appreciation of the currency against the USD.

Data as of May 31, 2022. Emerging market debt (EMD) returns were very diverse in May. External markets underperformed as spreads did not recover as well as credit markets. However, local markets did well, putting in one of the better returns across asset classes as EM currencies strengthened on the back of optimism that peak Fed funds rates were discounted. Another key differentiator has been external conditions whereby commodity exporters have generally benefited from high and rising commodity prices while commodity importers are suffering worsening trade balances. \u00d7 DISPLAY 3: Major Monthly Changes in 10-Year Yields and Spreads \uf065 Source: Bloomberg, JPMorgan.

Fixed Income Outlook Unfortunately, volatility is unlikely to go away. Even though most of the bear market in rates is likely behind us, upward pressure from high (even if falling) inflation and rate hikes will keep bond yields elevated. Central banks are highly likely to deliver what is priced into yield curves. Chairman Powell has reiterated multiple times the need to \u201cnormalize\u201d rates \u201cexpeditiously.\u201d We take that to mean moving the Fed funds rate to a minimum of 2.5% this year with risks skewed higher. Once the Fed gets rates to the 2.5-2.75% zone, the pace of rate hikes is likely to slow but continue. The extent of the move beyond \u201cnormal\u201d will be highly data dependent, meaning how the economy is performing in late summer and early fall. If growth continues to slow; labor markets loosen, softening wage growth. Most importantly, if inflation is moving lower, the Fed can slow the pace of tightening, protecting economic growth. However, it is not clear at all if these conditions will be met. Thus, the concern remains that the probability of the Fed lifting its terminal rate forecast at the June Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is significant, which could easily upset markets. Central banks in general remain on a hawkish trajectory, even those in countries that have already experienced significant rate hikes. New Zealand\u2019s central bank, one of the first to raise rates last year, was expected to announce a slowing or ending of its hiking cycle. Instead, it doubled down, saying overdoing it (in terms of rate hikes) was less risky than doing too little. Similar sentiments appear to be becoming the majority sentiment at the ECB where inflation has continued to surprise to the upside while economic growth has NOT taken as big a hit as was expected pre-Russian invasion of the Ukraine. Expect more hawkish rhetoric and actions by central banks. Central banks are not acting without reason. May data for business confidence, labor markets and consumer spending was resilient. Yes, in some cases like the U.S. Institute for Supply Management (ISM) data, results were weaker than expected, but they remain at robust levels and, we believe, are likely to stay firm as strong labor markets, strong income generation, healthy balance sheets and high savings keep service sector spending strong. It is difficult to see meaningful falls in inflation with economic fundamentals so solid. While goods producing sectors have peaked in terms of growth, services still have upside potential. We remain more wary of inflation than recession. The ending of Covid restrictions (at least for now) in China should also be a positive for the global economy with demand effects outweighing supply side improvements. If so, this will be another reason to expect commodity prices to remain firm, increasing the difficulty of central banks to bring down inflation, especially with household and corporate fundamentals so strong. The outlook for corporate bonds is mixed. The simple metric is: hard landing bad; soft landing good. While we wait to see which one wins out, spreads should remain in recent ranges (+120 \u2013 150 bps on U.S. IG index, somewhat higher on high yield, +350 \u2013 550 bps). Volatility amongst companies and sectors is likely to remain high as companies navigate high inflation and supply/ input challenges (and of course ongoing corporate disruption). Recent spread widening in April/May took spreads into recession-like territory (+150 bps). This proved too wide given continued economic resilience and higher absolute yields. On the other hand, corporate results are unlikely to improve significantly, leaving IG spreads stuck between where they began the year and May wides. We still like credit for their carry, see opportunities in idiosyncratic situations whereby some companies have been unduly punished in the April/May sell off. Emerging Markets (EM) was a tale of two markets in May. Local outperformed with external lagging significantly. Local returns were boosted by strong EM FX performance. Lower rated external EM continues to struggle with high energy and food inflation, undermining fiscal balances and economic growth. With several frontier economies on the verge of or restructuring, risk remains there as well. Countries that benefit from high oil and food prices have performed well. Country level analysis will be vital to uncover value as we expect markets to place an emphasis on differentiation amongst countries and credits. EM is likely to struggle as long as Developed Markets (DM) central banks remain on their current hawkish trajectory and inflation stays high. EM external looks reasonably attractive but lacks a catalyst to spark a rally. Developed Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW Broadly, the move in DM rates was mixed, occurring on a country-by-country basis. Central bank policy and indications from policy members drove much of the monthly moves, with a more dovish Fed bringing down most U.S. rates, while surprisingly hawkish sentiment from the ECB, Bank of England (BoE), and Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) led to selloffs elsewhere. Markets started pricing in more growth/recession concerns, leading risk assets to sell off and causing a more typical negative correlation between risk assets and U.S. Treasuries to appear, with Treasuries attractive as a safe haven asset.1 OUTLOOK Central banks are still forced to navigate a tough situation to achieve a soft landing that will cool inflation without pushing the economy into a recession. While the slight decline in U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) may indicate that the economy has pushed past the peak, the key will be how long, and how high, inflation will remain. Emerging Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW EMD segments were mixed in May with the local index achieving positive returns primarily due to broad currency strength, while average spreads on the hard currency indices\u2014both sovereign and corporate\u2014widened, leading to muted performance. Outflows continued from the asset class as a whole and across both local and hard currency funds.2 OUTLOOK Valuations appear to be compensating investors well at these levels while areas of opportunity remain. Inflationary pressures will likely continue for both developed and emerging markets in the near term as energy and food prices remain elevated. As such, Fed tightening remains a notable concern, but markets appear to be appropriately pricing in that risk. Country-level analysis will be critical in uncovering pockets of opportunity within this diverse universe. Corporate Credit MONTHLY REVIEW For much of the month, continued concern over the impact of inflation, interest rates and tightening liquidity on corporate and consumer health weighed on risk sentiment.3 As such, corporate credit sectors underperformed. Investment grade credit spreads widened slightly in May, with Europe notably underperforming the U.S. The high yield market experienced pronounced weakness for the balance of May before rallying aggressively in the final days of the month. Global convertibles fell again in May as well, underperforming both equities and bonds.4 The senior corporate loan market also sank in May.5 OUTLOOK Looking forward we see spreads rangebound. Markets are supported by more attractive valuations and strong corporate results, yet constrained by continued macro uncertainties, and weak technicals given the lack of demand while market volatility remains high. We are cautious on the high yield market. The high yield market experienced significant pockets of volatility this year and there is little to suggest the environment for high yield will become materially more supportive over the near term. While we have continued conviction in the loan market\u2019s relatively healthy credit picture, the geopolitical situation in Europe clouds the outlook. Securitized Products MONTHLY REVIEW Recession fears caused securitized credit spreads to widen further in May while government-guaranteed agency MBS tightened. Agency MBS bounced back and outperformed both U.S. Treasuries and credit assets in May, however, Agency MBS spreads are still materially wider than pre-pandemic levels as the market is pricing in the end of quantitative easing and likely the beginning of quantitative tightening. U.S. non-agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) spreads widened further across nearly all residential sectors over the month. U.S. ABS spreads were also wider in May, but fundamental credit performance remains strong.6 OUTLOOK We believe the securitized market still offers a unique combination of low durations, attractive yields, and solid credit fundamentals. We remain constructive on securitized credit and believe sector and security selection will become more important in the coming years if the economy softens. We remain cautious on agency MBS and interest rate risk. \u00d7 The views and opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Management team as of May 2022 and are subject to change based on market, economic and other conditions.

There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. \u00d7 Global Fixed Income Team Our fixed income investment capabilities are driven by eight specialized teams \u2013 Agency MBS, Emerging Markets, Floating-Rate Loans, High Yield, Investment Grade Credit, Municipals, Multi-Sector, and Securitized \u2013 which span the global fixed income capital markets.

{"content": "If March was a tough month, April was literally off the charts! Returns across the asset spectrum were dire, except of course if your asset included \u2018commodity\u2019 in its name. Rising yields and widening spreads were the name of the game. April was also the month when equities caught up to fixed income and now have worse returns year-to-date (S&amp;P 500 down 13.3%). While a bunch of problems in the world can be blamed on the Russian/Ukrainian situation, it is not the primary driver anymore. The reason for the carnage: inflation, inflation, inflation! And of course, what central banks are doing and planning to do about it. \u00d7 Inflation shows no sign of significantly abating. U.S. inflation may have peaked, but that is a hollow victory when headline inflation is 8.5% (highest since 1982). Central banks, particularly the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), are now on a warpath to get rates up quickly or \u201cexpeditiously\u201d using Chairman Powell\u2019s parlance. Markets have priced in rapid rate hikes generally everywhere, but most importantly in the U.S. where the economy appears to be overheating the most outside of Eastern Europe. With labor markets still firm if not too firm central banks will be in no mood to lift the slow pace of tightening until policy gets to at least neutral. Interestingly, for the first time in a while the U.S. yield curve steepened, with U.S. Treasury 2-year yields up only 38 basis points (bps) while U.S. Treasury 10-year yields rose 60 bps, suggesting the Fed is not doing enough to contain inflation risks, despite the fact that expectations of year-end 3-month rates rose 45 bps. The combination of the rise in yields, heightened worries of tighter policy AND a horrible performance of equities undermined credit and emerging markets. While the U.S. Treasury market returned -3.1% in April, investment-grade corporates returned -5%, high yield -3.6% and emerging markets -5.9%. The sharp fall in equities, bodes ill for high yield, the most equity sensitive part of fixed income. The risk-off environment in April also boosted the U.S. dollar. It rose anywhere from 2% against the Singapore dollar to 6.5% versus the Japanese yen to over 7% against the South African rand, a negative development for the global economy. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date \uf065 Note: USD-based performance.

Fixed Income Outlook Developments in April did not deviate materially from the trajectory established earlier this year. Inflation continues to be a source of concern which, combined with tight labor markets, will\u2014in our view\u2014keep central banks on their tightening trajectory. Commodities, particularly food prices are likely to firm further, exacerbating the central bank\u2019s inflation problem. The Fed does not plan to letup in tightening until at least policy is back to neutral, a level Chairman Powell has identified as a broad 2-3% range, giving them significantly leeway to up the pace this year if inflation does not improve. Another 150 bps of hikes this year looks taking U.S. Fed funds to the middle of the neutral range. Global yields remain biased to rise further. As time passes, it becomes clearer and clearer that monetary policy was kept too easy for too long. We are talking about ALL central banks save the ones in China and Japan. Monetary policy everywhere, not just in the U.S., is in a race to catch up to \u201cneutral\u201d or move to a restrictive stance. But the gap between inflation and interest rates remains wide in most countries, indicating that unless inflation falls materially or is expected to fall materially in the months ahead, more rate hikes are coming. If inflation does not fall enough (yet to be defined, but probably no higher than the Fed\u2019s current end of year forecast), expect additional unexpected tightening next year, i.e., a higher terminal Fed funds rate. This would raise the probability of a recession in 2023 and undermine credit assets. The primary reason for unremitting central bank hawkishness is growth remains firm despite all the challenges thrown at it this year. Although inflation is acting as a tax on households and businesses and yields are moving higher, labor markets and corporate profitability are strongly supporting spending. For example, financial balances among households and corporations (big and small) are strong in surplus. It is estimated that the household sector has a surplus of 0.8% of GDP larger than pre-pandemic AND has accumulated approximately $3 trillion of excess savings. Moreover, corporate excess savings across the entire corporate universe are also high, equating to about 3% of GDP. What this means is that the probability of achieving a soft landing, a reduction of inflation to target AND no recession is much higher. On the negative side, an economy with strong private sector balance sheets AND income generating capabilities will be harder to slow down, meaning the Fed may have to raise rates by more than is expected to get the requisite slowdown in demand to bring inflation to target. Thus, given the current level and trajectory of yields, we do not anticipate a recession either this year or next. The earliest it could happen based on our analysis is 2024. This is a long way off and supports a more 1994 interpretation of this year\u2019s rate hiking cycle as one that will slow things down enough to contain inflation without throwing the U.S. or global economy into a recession. We must keep in mind that the global economy is decelerating from a very high level with little risk of near-term economic downturn. Corporate profitability is likely to be varied. The energy, commodities, and defense sectors are likely to benefit; Healthcare and Telecoms will be least affected, and for Utilities it will depend on their exact regulatory and commodity exposure. Both industrial and consumer sectors will be negatively affected, but at least they were experiencing strong demand going into the crisis. However, there is no denying that the impact will be negative, with European corporates more affected. Spreads are now materially wider than at the beginning of the year, with notable underperformance of Europe. Credit fundamentals are mixed. Credit quality is mixed in terms of profitability, earnings growth has likely peaked, and leverage and margins are plateauing. But balance sheets, liquidity and debt servicing capacity remain exceptionally strong, in our opinion. And, importantly spread widening as nominal and yields rise and economic data slows. It will be important to differentiate those companies who can continue to thrive in such an environment. Active management is likely to be key to performance. We do maintain a preference at the margin for high yield over investment grade but that is very idiosyncratic and industry specific and of late have been reducing credit risk in general. EM outperformance has ended as global yields surged. Inflation problems tied to food and other commodities make many EM central banks biased to continue to raise rates as fast or faster than in developed countries. With several frontier economies on the verge of restructuring, risk remains there as well. Country level analysis will be vital to uncover value as we expect markets to place an emphasis on differentiation amongst countries and credits. EM is likely to struggle as long as DM central banks remain on their current hawkish trajectory and China struggles. A signal that things are turning will be a softening in the U.S. dollar. Although it has risen substantially in April and is likely to consolidate, there is no sign yet that its strength is coming to an end. Developed Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW In April, yields continued their upward trend as markets priced in even more hawkish central bank policy. While economic data was more mixed, it continued to remain strong overall and on average was better than economists expected, allowing central banks to emphasize curbing inflation rather than having to support growth. Risk assets in general performed poorly as investors worried about the impact of tighter monetary policy and rising costs.1 OUTLOOK Central banks have a challenging task in front of them: to curb inflation without hurting growth too much. Inflationary pressures remain very strong, but downside growth risks have also increased. The war in Ukraine continues, causing higher energy and commodity prices, which are already reducing consumer confidence and discretionary spending power. COVID remains impactful, with outbreaks in China sustaining supply chain disruptions. While a lot of hikes have already been priced in, neutral policy rate expectations are still modest vs. history, suggesting yields could rise further. Regarding foreign exchange, the U.S. dollar is likely to remain a beneficiary of tighter Fed policy and growing global growth concerns, while the yen may weaken further due to Japanese monetary policy being more accommodative than everywhere else. Emerging Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW Emerging Markets Debt (EMD) continued to be challenged along with the broader risk markets in April. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine persisted with their focus concentrated on the eastern region. The annual spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) occurred in Washington D.C. and in person for the first time since 2019. The overall tone was somewhat pessimistic as global growth was revised down for 2022 and 2023 and inflation projections increased.2 The three major EMD indices (U.S. dollar-denominated corporate debt,3 local sovereign debt,4 and U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign debt)5 were negative for the month. OUTLOOK We are optimistic on EMD as valuations appear to be well-compensating investors for the risk. The Russia/Ukraine war will continue to drive headlines and may continue for quite some time. Fundamentals are mixed, and while Fed tightening is a concern, markets appear to be pricing that in somewhat aggressively. The growth and inflation dynamic remains critical. Country level analysis will be vital to uncover value as we expect markets to place an emphasis on differentiation amongst countries and credits. Corporate Credit MONTHLY REVIEW Credit spreads widened in April with general market volatility elevated once again amidst heightened macro uncertainty. News in the month continued to be dominated by the conflict between Russia/Ukraine where no progress was made towards a resolution. Credit markets saw weak technicals with demand limited by the negative price action in fixed income as risk free yields rose. Supply in April was significantly down.6 The high yield market was particularly weak in April. Over the month, the average yield climbed and the average spread grew significantly amidst a sharp jump in Treasury yields and weak technical conditions. Growing concern over the eventual economic impact from aggressive tightening of monetary conditions and the potential for an eventual \u201chard landing\u201d prompted investors to reassess exposure to the lowest-rated segments of the high yield market. The top performing sectors for the month were transportation, other industrial and basic industry.7 Global convertibles fell the most in two years as concerns over inflation, interest rates and corporate earnings rattled markets. Convertibles, however, did outperform both of its underlying components. The convertibles market is now priced far closer to bonds than stocks as a lot of paper trades below par with less equity delta and more yield to maturity.8 OUTLOOK We see spreads likely to be rangebound. Markets are supported by more attractive valuations and strong corporate results yet constrained by the macro uncertainties and weak technicals given the lack of demand while market volatility remains high. We are cautious on the high yield market, which has experienced significant pockets of volatility this year and there is little to suggest the environment for high yield will be become materially more supportive over the near term. Securitized Products MONTHLY REVIEW April was another challenging month for securitized markets. Agency MBS underperformed again in April. Current coupon agency MBS spreads widened as the market is pricing in the end of quantitative easing (QE) and likely the beginning of quantitative tightening (QT). Agency MBS spreads could widen further as the Fed continues to reduce its purchases and possibly sell MBS. U.S. Non-agency RMBS spreads were significantly wider across all residential sectors in April, as nearly all risk assets cheapened given concerns about inflation, central bank policies and geo-political events. U.S. ABS spreads were also wider in April, but fundamental credit performance remains strong.9 OUTLOOK We believe the securitized market still offers a unique combination of low durations, attractive yields, and solid credit fundamentals. We remain constructive on securitized credit. We remain cautious on agency MBS and interest rate risk. \u00d7 The views and opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Management team as of May 2022 and are subject to change based on market, economic and other conditions.

{"content": "The private equity secondary market is fairly well known, and one could argue it has become heavily trafficked in recent years. Other secondary markets\u2014such as those for hedge funds and private credit\u2014may be less familiar to investors. While these markets are smaller, transactions can offer compelling returns. With the majority of return coming from realization of discount to net asset value (NAV), these investments can offer important risk mitigation benefits as well. This may be of particular interest today, against a backdrop of quantitative tightening and declining liquidity. \u00d7 Private equity fund investors seeking to sell interests on the secondary market have been met with robust demand. According to Preqin, the private equity secondary market has grown over five times in the last decade. Today, private equity secondary buyers collectively manage $300 billion with $127 billion of dry powder.1 (Display 1) This has resulted in high transaction volumes at limited discounts to net asset value for traditional private equity secondaries. \u00d7 Display 1: Private Equity Secondaries Assets Under Management ($bn) \uf065 Source: Preqin Secondary Market Update: H1 2021 \u00d7 Display 1: Private Equity Secondaries Assets Under Management ($bn) Source: Preqin Secondary Market Update: H1 2021 In contrast, alternative fund investors seeking to sell illiquid assets not comprised of private equity have not been met with this same level of demand. In fact, private equity secondaries comprised more than 90% of all alternative fund secondaries in 2021,2 leaving less than 10% in hedge funds, infrastructure, real estate, real asset and private credit funds combined. (Display 2) \u00d7 Display 2: Secondary Volume Across Alternative Asset Classes \uf065 Source: \u201cVolume Report FY 2021\u201d. Setter Capital. January 2022. \u00d7 Display 2: Secondary Volume Across Alternative Asset Classes Source: \u201cVolume Report FY 2021\u201d. Setter Capital. January 2022. Whereas the private equity secondary market is characterized by large intermediaries, transparent processes, cooperative general partners, standardized settlement mechanics and many well- capitalized buyers, the opposite conditions exist for other types of alternative fund secondary markets. We believe this vastly different demand dynamic presents a rich opportunity set for buyers who are able to pursue \u201cundiscovered\u201d secondary markets. Buyers may benefit from less efficient pricing and higher discounts to NAV. Compared to private equity secondaries, these higher discounts provide greater downside protection and make the strategy less reliant on growth in asset values and leverage to achieve returns. Below we delve into reasons why the demand dynamic differs\u2014why we think that will persist\u2014and why the dry powder within the private equity secondary market has not reached other alternative asset categories, notably hedge funds and private credit. Transaction Size The average size of private equity secondary funds raised in 1H 2020 was $4 billion.3 To efficiently deploy that capital, focusing due diligence on material position sizes and avoiding excessive line items, these private equity buyers tend to target average transaction sizes greater than $100 million. While the total hedge fund market is $4 trillion,4 the majority of that capital is redeemable at NAV and unlikely to require a secondary sale. When secondary needs do arise in illiquid hedge funds, the transaction size infrequently exceeds $50 million. Similarly, while private credit assets under management have grown substantially over the last decade, at $1.2 trillion5 the industry remains a fraction of the size of the $6.8 trillion6 private equity market. (Display 3) As is the case for hedge funds, this leads to lower transaction volumes and smaller transaction sizes for private credit secondaries. Because of their need to traffic in fairly large size, private equity secondary players find themselves confined to the one market that can supply large transactions today, traditional private equity. And they continue to aim their dry powder accordingly. \u00d7 Display 3: Private Debt Assets under Management and Forecast, 2010 \u2013 2026* \uf065 Source: 2022 Preqin Global Private Debt Report.

Asset Class By mandate and experience, private equity secondary players focus on funds that contain control private equity positions. Secondaries that arise in other types of alternative funds may include private equity, but typically span several asset classes including credit, litigation, real estate and real assets. Furthermore, the fund manager (or sponsor) may or may not have a control position. Private equity secondary buyers are not apt to traffic outside of their core asset class mandate, leaving these other alternative categories without a natural incumbent buyer. Structure Private equity fund structures are fairly homogeneous. They are generally closed- ended with an investment period, a harvest period and extension options; they usually charge a management fee and carried interest over a preferred return. Investors typically own a pro-rata portion of all investments in the fund. When secondary opportunities arise in hedge funds, the structures are quite disparate. For instance, illiquidity could be the result of an initial lock-up, a side pocket, a suspension in redemptions or myriad other reasons. Depending on the structure, hedge fund secondary investors could own a pro-rata portion of the fund or they could own underlying assets in differing portions. Fee structures are frequently modified and may differ between liquid and illiquid assets. These variables require nuanced due diligence, presenting a barrier to entry for potential buyers unaccustomed to such complexities. Relationships and Alignment of Interests While there are a small number of asset managers that span alternatives, for the most part the universes of private equity managers and hedge fund managers are distinct. Private equity secondary players tend to have relationships with private equity managers, but little familiarity with hedge fund managers. Hedge fund managers have no particular incentive to cultivate relationships with private equity secondary buyers. While private equity managers have the incentive to find buyers able to meet unfunded commitments, hedge fund investments are fully funded. Therefore, hedge funds are generally not as proactive in helping would-be sellers find buyers\u2014particularly buyers that are not likely to support growth in the liquid side of their businesses. Process and Transparency A traditional private equity secondary transaction entails multiple rounds of bids organized by an intermediary with a well-populated data room and access to the sponsor. Once the winning bidder is determined, the closing mechanics are fairly uniform. Financing is typically available to the buyer, if desired. Buyers and sellers of illiquid funds in other alternative categories are not typically able to engage in the same process. Because of a combination of lack of size, motivation and secondary experience, information is not as readily accessible. Buyers with historical knowledge of the assets and an existing relationship with the asset manager are better-positioned to overcome this barrier to entry. Discounts Are Worth the Effort We believe that secondary investors should expand their focus beyond the well-trodden private equity secondary market. While traversing in undiscoveredsecondary markets has challenges, it can be rewarding. For buyers who are able to navigate this more opaque terrain and are willing to deploy less capital per opportunity, the discounts to NAV can be much greater. In a period of declining equity and fixed income valuations, the higher discount to NAV can provide portfolios much-needed downside protection, shifting the driver of return toward liquidity provision versus growth in asset prices. \u00d7 1 Preqin Secondary Market Update: H1 2021 2 \u201cVolume Report FY 2021\u201d.

{"content": "I think there is a greater than 50% chance that the S&amp;P 500 intra-day low of May 20th (S&amp;P 500 = 3810) was the market low for the year. There are plenty of reasons why that may not be the case, but I am increasingly of the opinion that, while it\u2019s not necessarily clear sailing from here, that low might hold. Let\u2019s begin with a discussion of the three supporting reasons for my conclusion before moving to the arguments against. Technical On May 20th, the market dropped to, and ultimately rejected, a 20% correction. A substantial close below that level would have moved the market into a true bear market. The market stopped dropping at the important 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the 2020-2022 rally. The following week, the NYSE had 3 days in a row where over 80% of the total volume was on the upside. That\u2019s a very bullish sign. The last three times the market had that kind of positive breadth (2011, 2016 and 2020), every time stopped a decline and led to dramatic upside in stocks over the following three and six months. On June 2nd, Fed Vice Chair Brainard sounded surprisingly hawkish, and the largest software company in the world lowered guidance. While seemingly two big negatives, the market rallied despite the news. As Leon Cooperman says, a good time to buy stocks is when they stop going down on bad news. Macro Could 2022 be a repeat of 1998, 2011 and 2018? In each of those years, the market declined and stopped just short of -20%, followed by a dramatic recovery leading to new all-time highs within 6 months. In each of those years, the macro issues causing the selloff were very different, as they are in 2022. However, the commonality was in each of those years there was no recession. In effect, the market rejected the macro issues that had caused the anxious selloff. So, will we have a recession this year? That question leads to my final reason of why May 20th could have been the low for the year: Fundamental Clearly, corporate America does not see the same level of weakness that the stock market is projecting. Insider buying is off the charts\u20141 standard deviation above trend. Except for the energy area, insider selling has dried up. Corporate buybacks are accelerating. The original estimate of $750 billion in buybacks for the year has already reached $600 billion just for the first half of 2022.1 Anecdotally, I hear corporate buyback desks are quite busy. Not to mention, earnings guidance has moved HIGHER. Yes, that\u2019s right, higher, NOT lower. The bottom-up S&amp;P 500 consensus earnings (which is what companies use to guide the sell side) has moved higher every week, not lower. Clearly the economy is slowing. I do not expect revisions to continue higher forever, but my base case all year has been that the economy will prove far more resilient than what the bears predict. So far, this has certainly proven to be the case. All in all, the arguments are compelling for May 20th being the equity market low for the year, so why wouldn\u2019t I indicate more confidence than a \u201cgreater than 50% chance\u201d? Because there are plenty of issues to cause worry: Quantitative tightening (QT): We have never experienced a similar magnitude of QT before. Therefore, there is no way to know the ramifications of the Fed not buying as much as $30 \u2013 $60+ billion of Treasuries and as much as $35 billion of mortgage-backed securities per month. Jamie Dimon\u2019s statement: \u201cA hurricane is coming.\u201d What does that mean? What does he see? Don\u2019t Fight the Fed. They still have plenty of tightening to go. Sky-high gasoline prices. How much will this dent other consumption?. While some inflationary inputs seem to be peaking, the actual inflation rate is still running at a level that historically does not provide good equity returns. Therefore, the recession call becomes key. But if there is no recession, stocks could be substantially higher by the time that is apparent. I am not in the \u2018recession is coming\u2019 camp. I agree with corporate America, but clearly, we cannot rule out the possibility. So what\u2019s an investor to do? The S&amp;P 500 has had a relatively rapid bounce off that 3810 low. I would not be surprised to see some short-term weakness.. But I maintain the 6-12 month returns off these levels will be very attractive, and therefore expecting further substantial weakness may be either too greedy or overly pessimistic. Finally, two quick points on AEA\u2019s portfolio positioning. We have had a value over growth bias in our U.S. exposure. That is moderating. We believe the magnitude of underperformance of quality growth stocks (particularly in the consumer sector) leads us to increase our growth allocation. Clearly there are negative headlines, but the real money is never made when \u201cthe coast is clear\u201d. Our stock selection bias is to favor companies that have generated high levels of profitability relative to their peers and have produced outsized shareholder returns over time, adding them to the portfolios when they are out of favor and depressed. Increasingly, quality growth stocks are meeting these criteria. Our Global strategies have steadfastly maintained a significant allocation to Asia ex-Japan, while remaining underweight in Europe and Japan. While the Asia ex-Japan overweight hurt performance in 2021 and into 2022, the tide is beginning to turn as China reopens from the COVID lockdown, growth-supportive initiatives continue, and regulatory risks appear to be receding. As the clouds begin to clear, these stocks are attracting more investor interest. 1 JPMorgan.

{"content": "In our view, health care is a natural place to look for high quality, defensive companies. In many cases, revenues and barriers to entry are protected by patents, regulation and long-term contracts. However, the longer-term compounding power of individual companies must be considered on a stock-by-stock basis, as fortunes can diverge materially. \u00d7 It is not enough to rely on long patent lives, generous pricing and decade-old therapies and frameworks. We look for companies with the ability to innovate, provide new therapies and treatments, and participate in scientific paradigm shifts, all of which may directly impact longer-term earnings power and the ability to sustain high returns on operating capital. One of the most important shifts to consider with respect to our health care companies is the development of \u201cpersonalised medicine\u201d. Personalised medicine is impacting many parts of the health care value chain, and is paving the way for novel therapies and cures for diseases that were once thought to be incurable. Take for example Usher syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that causes deafness and blindness in young children, for which there is currently no cure. Formulating a cure for diseases such as this will be revolutionary, but the science and technology underpinning it is not new. It lies in the process of \u201cgenomic sequencing\u201d, which involves comparing the genetic make-up of someone with a particular disease to that of someone without it, allowing researchers to identify the faulty gene that is the cause. In 1990, sequencing the first human genome cost $5.5 billion and took 13 years. Today it takes less than one day and costs approximately $200. Usher syndrome may be cured when the faulty gene can be replaced with a working one, preventing the onset of symptoms that lead to deafness and blindness. Genomic sequencing has already been central to the development of treatment for certain diseases. Immunotherapy drugs, for example, directly attack cancer in a new way, by altering the expression of cancer genes. Enter the era of personalised medicine: treating patients based on their own genetic make-up, predicted response and risk of disease. \u00d7 \" Personalised medicine is impacting many parts of the health care value chain, and is paving the way for novel therapies and cures for diseases that were once thought to be incurable One step forward: the promise of personalised medicine The genomic revolution has enabled a shift from a one-size-fits-all approach in health care to a personalised approach. Using the traditional one-size-fits-all approach is like walking into a shoe shop and buying any old pair of shoes without checking the size or trying them on. Personalised medicine is the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual genetic characteristics of each patient and their specific disease. A Swiss multinational pharmaceutical\u2019s Zolgensma is perhaps the most stunning example of gene therapy, which is a specific type of personalised medicine. Zolgensma works by replacing a faulty gene with a working gene and is used as a cure for inherited spinal muscular atrophy in young children. While still in their early development and costly to access, gene therapies hold the promise of being able to cure a variety of medical conditions beyond this point. Another example of personalised medicine is a British-Swedish biopharmaceutical company\u2019s Enhertu. This represents a huge step forward in the war against cancer through the development of personalised medicine. Existing chemotherapies poison healthy cells in the body, in the hope of catching the cancerous ones in the process. Enhertu uses complex technology to deliver chemotherapy only to the cancerous cells: this saves the healthy cells and allows physicians to give more of the highly toxic and powerful drug to a localised site. Enhertu holds the promise of treating very specific types of breast cancer, for which there is negligible existing treatment available. Two steps back: the pitfalls of personalised medicine The development of personalised medicine is a rocky road. Drug developers have faced the usual threats of trial failures where therapies are not effective or safe enough. Even in cases where these drugs make it through trials and are actually approved by regulators, some may carry unwanted side effects. In the case of some gene therapies, only 25% of potential populations are eligible for treatment due to prohibitive cost and safety issues. On top of this, some physicians demand a better track record of safety for the drug before administering a \u201cone-shot cure\u201d that will affect the patient for life and cannot be reversed. For conditions like haemophilia, patients may prefer to stay on existing treatments and wait 10 to 20 years to see how the hoped-for cure is working. However, not all patients have this luxury. Children with inherited spinal muscular atrophy have a life expectancy of just two years, meaning Zolgensma is potentially life-saving. For some, the step forward is worth the risk. The impact of the personalised medicine revolution on investing in the health care sector What do these promises and risks around personalised medicine mean for stock-picking opportunities in health care? We do not believe in owning individual companies on the basis that they are developing a specific drug. Single drug companies (such as early stage biotechs) are on the front line of progress and drug development, but are also the first to suffer from the setbacks. Single drug investments also carry significant concentration risk and do not necessarily translate into longer-term compounding power, particularly once the drug goes off patent (roughly 10 years after approval). Fortunately, this revolution is not limited to the drugs themselves. The shift to personalised medicine requires extensive adaptations in the way that health care is provided, paid for and monitored, resulting in second and third derivative health care beneficiaries that offer investment opportunities. As treatments become more targeted and complex, so too does the way diseases are diagnosed and monitored. How do you know which therapy to give a patient if you are not able to properly classify the specific type of disease? Diagnostics drive 70% of treatment decisions, and if treatments are changing, diagnostics must change with them. Diagnostic testing is crucial for health economics. If physicians are able to correctly identify the relevant marker of disease through testing, health care systems do not waste drugs on patients who would never have responded to the drug in the first place. The likes of a U.S. diversified health care company and a U.S. diversified science and technology company are at the forefront of developing molecular diagnostic tests that are used in assessing a patient\u2019s individual suitability for personalised medicines. Diagnostics companies carry the benefit of having exposure to the trend of increasingly complex drug development, without the associated risks of trial failures, patent expiries and pricing pressures. Health care has made massive strides in the development and delivery of personalised medicine. Revolutionary benefits to patients are also bolstering the compounding potential of these high quality investments. \u00d7 Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy\u2019s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 Helena Miles Senior Associate International Equity Team Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/one-step-forward-two-steps-back.html"}

While progress among public companies has been made to increase representation of women at varying levels, the power dynamic has remained largely unchanged at the top.

{"content": "AT A GLANCE \u2022 Big Tech has grown incredibly large, fueled by the unprecedented collection, processing and analysis of digital data. \u2022 Yet this growth has conflicted with users\u2019 interests, particularly in areas related to user privacy, and misinformation. This may raise questions about the sustainability of Big Tech\u2019s growth models. \u2022 At the same time, these companies\u2019 concentrated market power also raises questions about potential antitrust action. \u2022 Corporate governance structures appear inadequate for guiding more effective self-regulation, which raises regulatory risks at a time when technology is being buffeted by macro headwinds. \u2022 In our view, shining a sustainability light on the dark side of Big Tech can yield important insights into risks that traditional (non-ESG) approaches may under-appreciate. \u00d7 Introduction In today\u2019s digital economy, data is the key resource underpinning economic value creation. Data is crucial to the development of most online services and is indispensable to the development of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Capturing and analysing data is therefore central to the business models of some of the most successful companies in today\u2019s economy. However, as with the overuse of natural resources, the pervasive collection of data, particularly personal data, has negative externalities that cannot be ignored. In this paper, we focus on the \u201cBig Tech\u201d companies that dominate the new data economy. We discuss the potential social consequences associated with digital data mining and assess whether these issues might become a headwind for these data-driven companies, which are increasingly in the shadow of the regulator. By \u201cBig Tech,\u201d we are primarily referring to mega-cap technology companies headquartered in the U.S.1 While not homogeneous, we find it analytically useful to bundle these companies together, given their societal omnipresence and market power. The Rise and Rise of Big Tech Notwithstanding recent market volatility, Big Tech firms have grown to be among the largest public companies in the world. As a result, U.S. large-cap capitalization-weighted indices such as the S&amp;P 500 are now much less diversified. In fact, just five companies in our \u2018Big Tech\u2019 category make up almost 23% of the S&amp;P 500, with the two largest constituents\u2019 combined weight (13.0%) now larger than that of the Real Estate, Energy, Materials and Utilities and sectors combined (11.5%). Big Tech is the Internet Big Tech firms typically provide access to digital platforms, which connect buyers and sellers or individual users. Often, these platforms\u2019 strong network effects benefit from economies of scale, which reinforce a potential \u201cwinner takes all\u201d dynamic. Put simply, the more a product is used, the more useful it becomes. Consider the example of online social networks, which are more useful for individuals if everyone they know is on the same platforms. Data facilitates these network effects, with the firm\u2019s product usefulness enhanced by either using revenues derived from user data or by exploiting insights derived from the collected user interaction data. This, in turn, attracts more users and drives more revenue. These same network effects and economies of scale may explain concentration in some segments of the digital economy. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Market Cap of the Five Big Tech Companies as % of S&amp;P 500 Index \uf065 Source: Bloomberg; Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

Growth vs User Protection? Big Tech\u2019s thirst for growth is leading toward an inevitable conflict between their interests and those of users\u2014conflict that regularly manifests as risks under the social pillar of ESG. We believe that investors who fully appreciate these social risks may benefit, particularly as these conflicts materialise and attract the attention of regulators in key markets. For example, the more personal data a platform harvests and stores, the more the platform\u2019s operator will be exposed to risks around privacy concerns. Additionally, the addictive nature of many platforms also raises the potential for societal problems such as damage to users\u2019 mental health, misinformation and even extremism. These issues may pose a risk to companies\u2019 value creation by limiting their growth prospects, either through the migration of users or advertisers or, increasingly, through regulatory and competition initiatives. Social Responsibility The Algorithm Decides For Big Tech companies that rely on data harvesting, engagement is key to growth. Big Tech platforms can capture more valuable data by keeping user attention fixed for longer. The drive to maximize data collection and therefore value has resulted in systems optimized to capture and retain users\u2019 attention, with little regard for consequences. Content is a case in point. Material that elicits a strong emotional reaction has proven highly effective in capturing user attention and prolonging engagement. It is little wonder that the pursuit to optimize engagement can lead to algorithms designed to amplify and promote sensational and divisive content.2 Consider, too, that algorithms curate content based on a user\u2019s unique interests. Such personalization limits exposure to outside views in a process that can create view-distorting \u201cfilter bubbles.\u201d Roger McNamee, the renowned early Big Tech investor turned activist, claims that filtering results in social polarization, rising mental health issues, hate speech and even violence.3 On the one hand, this combination can prove fertile ground for the spread of disinformation. For example, disinformation related to Covid-19 and vaccines has proliferated across social media, resulting in vaccine hesitancy among some populations.4 In 2019, this led the World Health Organization to add vaccine hesitancy to the list of the top 10 threats to global health.5 On the other hand, global society is not oblivious to the dangers of indiscriminate algorithmic preferencing. A recent worldwide poll conducted by Lloyds Register Foundation and Gallup, of 150,000 people in 142 countries, found that internet users view \u201cfake news\u201d as their major concern.6 Ultimately, this suggests that users may push back. Platforms that fail to address the scourge of \u201cfake news\u201d may see users, and their valuable data, migrate elsewhere. \u00d7 DISPLAY 3: \u201cFake News\u201d a Key Worry for Global Internet Users \uf065 Source: Lloyd\u2019s Register Foundation.

(2020) The Lloyd\u2019s Register Foundation World Risk Poll. Self-Regulation \u2013 A Solution? While algorithms may lack the value systems of humans, they reflect the biases of their creators. The proliferation of algorithms in sorting and selecting content places a responsibility on the creators to ensure they are trained on a sufficiently diverse data set. Failure to self-regulate could impose burdens on companies such as increased transparency or limiting of use of algorithmic prioritizing, such as those proposed by U.S. House Lawmakers in the Filter Bubble Transparency Act. To date, tech companies have been slow to address this problem, save in extreme cases. This is due in part to a piece of U.S. legislation enacted in the 90s, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which grants wide immunity against liability for harmful content posted on platforms. However, support has emerged to amend Section 230 and the changes could have profound effects. Each internet platform company operating in the U.S. has explicitly identified Section 230 amendments as a business risk. Even if exposed companies manage to avoid costly sanctions through self-regulation, they would likely be forced to invest significantly into content-management initiatives, particularly as their presence grows in emerging markets, which have varying cultural and linguistic requirements. As operating expenses in technology can be high, even before these added outlays, additional expenses to monitor content may surprise to the downside. Additionally, if users feel like their free speech rights are being infringed upon by overzealous moderation, they may seek alternative, more laissez-faire platforms. This highlights the delicate balancing act today\u2019s virtual public squares must strike between free speech and content moderation. Privacy Paradox As more activities move online, data privacy and protection have become paramount. Data privacy is centered around how data is collected, processed, stored and shared with third parties. Handling troves of digital personal data leaves Big Tech companies highly exposed to concerns around privacy. However, do users care about privacy? The evidence is mixed. Users voluntarily sign lengthy and complex legal terms and services (T&amp;Cs) documents detailing the use of their personal data by the platform and their partners for commercial purposes. A study of 2,000 consumers in the U.S. found that 91% consent to legal T&amp;Cs without reading them,7 a phenomenon known as \u2018click wrap\u2019. Thus, it is likely users do not fully comprehend the volume of data that is gathered on them. In fact, studies show that users do care about the scale and intensity of data harvesting when this is disclosed to them. 8 Given the frequent controversies around data use, we believe users may become more discerning. While they are typically happy to share data in exchange for a useful, free, or personalized product, they may be more likely to withhold permission when it is for services they do not highly value, such as targeted advertising. A 2021 UBS survey of circa 2,000 Americans found that 42% of respondents have already updated their privacy settings on a social media site to be more restrictive and 22% plan to. Notably, the rate of teenage users planning to update their privacy settings has risen consistently, indicating that younger cohorts may find the privacy/personalization trade-off as less valuable than older generations.9 Given some Big Tech companies heavy reliance on data informed advertising revenue (95% plus of 2021 revenues for some of the largest companies in our set), there is a strong economic motivation to extract as much user data as possible. Clearly, this impulse runs headfirst into the privacy interests of users and, increasingly, of regulators. \u00d7 DISPLAY 4: GDPR at a Glance \uf065 Source: CMS.Law GDPR Enforcement Tracker (2021), https://www.enforcementtracker.com \u00d7 DISPLAY 4: GDPR at a Glance Source: CMS.Law GDPR Enforcement Tracker (2021), https://www.enforcementtracker.com ESG Sharpens the Oversight Spotlight These social issues come against the backdrop of ongoing global debate about whether Big Tech\u2019s market power and business practices have become disadvantageous to consumer welfare, competition, and productivity. As it is, Technology is lightly regulated in comparison to other sectors. We believe this is for a variety of reasons. The internet industry is comparatively young and has come to prominence in an era during which American public discourse has opposed industrial regulation as burdensome, innovation limiting instruments. However, growing scrutiny into the business practices of today\u2019s tech titans is seeing bipartisan support emerge in key markets such as the U.S. and Europe to curb their influence. As the negative externalities associated with Big Tech become more widely recognized, the end of the \u201clight touch\u201d internet regulatory regime may be near. Privacy laws limit the flow of data Regulating data sharing via privacy laws is one way to address these concerns. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 137 out of 194 countries have passed legislation designed to protect data and privacy. The EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) statute, passed in 2016, is among the most comprehensive data privacy laws passed. Among other things, GDPR requires an individual\u2019s consent when using their personal data, thereby giving individuals greater protection and control. Due to its extraterritorial reach, companies based outside the EU can fall in the scope of GDPR if they collect and process an EU citizen\u2019s personal data. Non-compliance with GDPR can result in heavy penalties and reputational damage, including eyewatering fines of up to either \u20ac20million or up to 4% of annual global revenue. It should be noted that interpretation of GDPR varies within Europe and while fines have generally been increasing, regulators have shown restraint. No company has been hit with the headline 4% fine yet and few expect that to change. Recent court rulings in Europe continue to make data transfer outside the EU incredibly complex for tech companies operating in the U.S. The Court of Justice of the EU in its Schrems II judgment declared that companies who intend to transfer personal data outside the EU must ensure that GDPR-equivalent protection is provided, or they must suspend the transfer. We expect that the evolution of data protection regulations globally will continue to force changes to company practices, slowing their growth through loss of data, lower efficacy and poorer quality of content. Continued concerns around data collection and the slow rate of change by companies means that a worst-case scenario such as being locked out of markets, while unlikely, should not be entirely dismissed. Investors should be mindful therefore of the fundamental risk that privacy regulations impose. \u00d7 DISPLAY 5: Dual-Class Structure Trends over time \uf065 Source: Ritter, J.

Initial Public Offerings: Dual Class Structure of IPOs Through 2021 (2022). U.S. Antitrust growing FAANGS? Experts believe that Big Tech\u2019s stewardship over large pools of user data confers substantial advantages. They point to the feedback loop conferred on Big Tech through its network effects described earlier. The OECD notes that \u201cthe dominant platform may not do anything that can be properly qualified as anti-competitive, and yet the feedback loop can reinforce dominance and prevent rival platforms from gaining customers.\u201d Consequently, many argue that today\u2019s Big Tech companies exert monopoly power that can block competitors and disadvantage users in ways that would not have been permissible for most of the 20th century. Europe once again leads the charge against Big Tech on this front. The EU\u2019s proposed Digital Markets Act seeks to blacklist certain anticompetitive business practices that allegedly have allowed Big Tech to exploit their size and entrench their position as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d. The Act is expected to come in to force at the end of 2022 once approved by both the European Parliament and Council. The U.S. has taken some steps towards addressing Big Tech\u2019s power. We first discussed this in our July 2021 Insight10 where we identified Lina Khan\u2019s appointment to chair the U.S. competition regulator as well as a raft of bills introduced in the U.S. to amend anti-trust law to make enforcement easier. However, despite Europe\u2019s proposals and U.S. tentative steps to curb Big Tech\u2019s power, the limited antitrust risk premium built into these firms\u2019 valuations suggests that few believe today\u2019s tech titans will be brought to heel. On a longer-term basis, we are less sanguine than the market. For instance, over the next 3-4 years, we believe that antitrust developments could hurt the growth prospects for Big Tech companies, particularly when it comes to M&amp;A, which is likely to face intense scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic. Governance Growing Pains Taken together, the recent strengthening of antitrust and privacy enforcement has grown out of these companies\u2019 perceived failure to self-regulate. The failure to self-regulate may reflect a culture where leadership often goes unchallenged. Indeed, decision-making power is often heavily concentrated, with founders exerting significant influence on strategy, be it through force of personality or corporate shareholding structures. Dual class stock, which is prevalent in tech, entitles the owner(s) of certain shares to exercise voting rights at levels that exceed their claim on cash-flow rights. Some believe that this allows a founder or founder group to focus on a more beneficial long-term strategy, rather than being constrained by short-term considerations. Consequently, investors will have to grapple with certain trade-offs. They must assess not only the nature of the shareholdings, but also the nature of the company, industry and controller. And while we agree that simplified control structures may be beneficial in a company\u2019s early growth stages, they place enormous power in the hands of leadership and the select few employees to whom leaders delegate key responsibilities. Given the size and complexity of Big Tech organizations we believe that this concentrated power in should be recognized as a risk. This is exacerbated by the increasing frequency with which these companies find themselves in the regulatory spotlight. Structuring decision-making processes to move away from the narrow views of the few, to incorporate more diverse perspectives, could help to mitigate some of these regulatory and reputational risks. The Investment Outlook for Big Tech While Big Tech has enjoyed a relatively unhindered rise to prominence, the headwinds are getting stronger. In the near term, the macro backdrop of slowing growth, ongoing inflationary pressure and subsequent rising nominal and real rates means that we generally expect developed market growth stocks like Big Tech to underperform. Over the next couple of years we expect that a more challenging operating environment, in the shadow of regulators and competition authorities on both sides of the Atlantic, may limit Big Tech\u2019s growth potential upon which its valuations depend. As outlined throughout this piece, many of the biggest risks facing Big Tech are related to the \u201cS\u201d pillar within ESG. Issues around privacy and social responsibility may not be considered material for a traditional investor, however, an approach that fully integrates ESG could help gain a more thorough understanding of what drives the risks for Big Tech. Given that these companies are the largest constituents in major equity benchmarks, such as the S&amp;P 500, both active and index investors should consider the potential impact of these ESG risks. \u00d7 1 However, a number of relatively small companies that exhibit similar business practices focused on data collection share the same ESG risks we touch on 2 Cobbe, J., &amp; Singh, J.

Fed\u2019s hawkish surprise, yet markets unruffled (2021) \u00d7 Risk Considerations There is no assurance that the Strategy will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser\u2019s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio\u2019s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio\u2019s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. ESG Strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 Andrew Harmstone Managing Director, Lead Portfolio Manager Global Balanced Risk Control Team Li Zhang Head of ESG, Global Balanced Risk Control team Global Balanced Risk Control Team Kian Masters ESG Analyst Global Balanced Risk Control Team \u00d7 Christian Goldsmith Managing Director, Lead Portfolio Specialist Global Balanced Risk Control Team", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/shining-a-sustainability-light-on-big-tech.html"}
{"content": "As companies continue to adapt to the changed world of work caused by the global pandemic, the need to prioritize gender-focused diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies remain as important as ever. In this Q&amp;A, Morgan Stanley Investment Management\u2019s Seema Hingorani, Marte Borhaug and Yijia Chen share their views on the vital role gender diversity plays in companies. They discuss where progress can still be made, why they believe leadership teams should think beyond quotas, and how an engaged investor can advance a gender equality agenda. \u00d7 Why does gender diversity, equity and inclusion matter for you as an investor? MARTE BORHAUG (MB): It is quite simple, really. In addition to being the right thing to do, gender inclusion is good for business, which makes it good for us as investors. For many, this seems self-evidently true, but others will naturally want to see the research, of which there is plenty. For example, one of the most quoted studies, by McKinsey, finds that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams are 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the bottom quartile.1 As an investor, I think it\u2019s important to understand why we see this outperformance. What are the specific drivers? There are many reasons. I will mention two here. For starters, gender diversity helps to promote innovation. A study by the Boston Consulting Group found that companies with leadership teams that have above-average diversity generate, through product innovation, revenues that are 19 percentage points superior to companies with less diverse leadership teams, and enjoy earnings, before taxes and interest, that are 9 percentage points higher.2 And it's not just earnings. According to a study by MSCI, boards with higher levels of gender diversity tend to experience fewer instances of governance-related controversies, including bribery, corruption and fraud.3 In summary, research shows that companies with above average gender representation are better able to solve problems creatively, bounce back from failings and turn challenges into opportunities. As investors, we believe these qualities make more diverse companies more attractive for investment. \u00d7 \" Research shows that companies with above-average gender representation are better able to solve problems creatively, bounce back from failings and turn challenges into opportunities. YIJIA CHEN (YC): I agree, studies have shown that gender diversity is a material factor to company performance across countries and sectors. Interestingly, the McKinsey study shows that the rewards and penalties that accrue to the best and worst performers compound over time, and can lead to dramatically different long-term performance. Echoing Marte\u2019s points about potential drivers, we believe companies that demonstrate leading or improving DEI practices can attract and retain better talent, which promotes productivity that can help the company position better for longterm value creation. Lastly, diverse viewpoints can be additive to the decision-making process precisely because they bring in new perspectives and challenge traditional thinking. SEEMA HINGORANI (SH): Different perspectives are particularly important for risk management, in my opinion. The global financial crisis is a case in point. Within markets, we saw a situation where the same type of people were making the same types of decisions, resulting in groupthink. When I founded Girls Who Invest, a nonprofit organization designed to bring more young women into investment management careers, the need to challenge traditional thinking, as Yijia said, was very much in my mind. In the curriculum, we teach the core finance and investment concepts that are necessary for successful internships, but we also focus on educating our scholars on market events like what happened in 2008. The idea is to make sure that these young women are well prepared to enter the industry and understand that their voices are needed at the decision-making table to help make sure that this kind of crisis does not happen again. In your view, is the business case for gender equity well understood by corporate leaders today? MB: To be blunt, no. While there are leaders doing the right thing, if all corporate leaders really understood the business case, we would see a very different reality on company boards and in senior management. Unfortunately, diversity still doesn\u2019t seem to get the right kind of attention or be considered a business necessity. For example, some corporate leaders argue the business case is wrong because appointing a woman to the board does not magically improve performance. Clearly, single appointments alone are unlikely to achieve such an outcome, but broader diversity within the top leadership, middle management and overall workforce will lead to different ways of thinking and ultimately in our opinion help improve performance, even if not immediately. Tackling diversity may also be difficult, as challenging traditional thinking and groupthink naturally creates discomfort. Leaders committed to DEI must be prepared to confront these growing pains. I also believe that some corporate leaders are at risk of \u201cgender complacency.\u201d Companies may get to 30% or more of representation on their boards and then consider it a job well done. But we\u2019ve still got a long way to go. If you look at most businesses, very few can claim to be at parity in representation at every level across the organization. Proclaiming the gender question resolved is a problem because, although we are on a good path, a lot of work remains to be done to ensure everyone has the same opportunity to succeed regardless of their gender. SH: Ultimately, diversity is about making business better and not about social good. It seems that some leaders still feel obligated to prioritize diversity on moral grounds, but they should not lose sight of the fact that gender diversity can make businesses better. I\u2019ve been encouraged by the progress that I\u2019ve seen in the last five to 10 years, but there are still some who look at this as ticking a box and filling quotas. For instance, we frequently see situations where a company that is eager to recruit a woman to the board only seek out candidates with prior board experience since that appears as a safer approach. As a result, we see a small pool of the same women sitting on five or more company boards, which does little to expand the opportunity set of talented and diverse female voices in the corporate sector more broadly. YC: Understanding of the business case varies significantly across the world. We know that European countries are the leaders for gender representation in senior positions, but progress elsewhere is sometimes overlooked. In Asia, for instance, Japan lags developed markets\u2019 peers in gender representation,4 but nascent changes are taking place. More and more, Japanese companies are making their first female board appointments. In fact, the share of Japanese companies with at least one woman on the board has increased to 88% from 67% over a three-year period.5 South Korea, meanwhile, is experiencing a similar trend. In 2019, more than 77% of companies had all-male boards. Now, it is about 41%.6 Clearly, more work remains to be done, but the trend is headed in the right direction. As the business case becomes better understood in more countries, we expect the focus to grow beyond board and executive representation to include company policies that affect gender diversity outcomes. Pay equity is an obvious one, but there are many others. Are companies doing enough to address the gender gap at the C-suite and board levels? SH: Companies are improving, but can do more. Screening criteria, for instance, has historically required board candidates to have a certain level of experience, including CEO experience. However, the top ranks of companies are not very gender diverse, which can create a Catch-22 situation, wherein poor gender representation among chief executives begets poor gender representation on boards. The stringent requirements exclude many talented people with other relevant experience. A candidate with profit-and-loss responsibilities, a valuable skill in the corporate sector, for example, could be a complement to many boards, given the opportunity. MB: There has been improvement at board level, in part because board diversity became a focus for investors and regulators. Here, the next step is to start broadening representation to include women from different backgrounds. Going forward, I expect to see more focus on executive teams, which lag behind boards. For example, female board representation is around 40% in the U.K., up from roughly 12% a decade ago.7 In contrast, at the executive level, representation has remained stubbornly low at 22% in recent years with very little improvement, and there are still companies with entirely male executive committees. \u00d7 \" The top ranks of companies are not very gender diverse, which can create a Catch-22 situation, wherein poor gender representation among chief executives begets poor gender representation on boards. The so-called \u201cPeter Problem\u201d encapsulates this gender disparity well. Few people know that there are actually more CEOs named Peter leading top U.K. companies than female CEOs.8 In the U.S., a similar problem exists, with CEOs named David outnumbering total female counterparts in the S&amp;P 500. This is clearly far away from the levels of diversity we would want to see. YC: Companies can do more than solely targeting gender quotas, but that will require a deeper commitment and change in corporate culture. Norway is one of the countries leading the way in gender diversity. As of today, Calvert\u2019s own research finds Norwegian large-cap companies have the highest female board representation on average among their peers.9 A recent study10 finds that mandatory quotas have been the biggest spur to progress in female board representation within Norwegian public companies, going from 6% in 2002 to 42% in 2016. However, the ripple effects have been pretty slow with public companies faring far better than their private counterparts with regards to gender equity at board level.11 This is also true for U.S. companies\u2014nearly half of private company boards are all male, while 100% of S&amp;P 500 companies\u2019 boards include at least one woman.12 Anecdotal evidence shows that cultural attitudes play important roles. For instance, we have seen a number of high-profile occurrences where female CEOs are parachuted in after corporate crises, typically, DEI-related crises. Sometimes these new leaders manage to rescue the companies, while others come in too late or face internal opposition that stymies change. In the end, appointing a new CEO alone cannot change corporate culture or a company\u2019s fortunes, if everything else remains unchanged. More broadly, what steps can companies take to improve gender equity? SH: Developing the talent pipeline is critical. Companies have to broaden their scope for recruitment to attract candidates with different backgrounds and experiences. To reflect on our own experience at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, we have found that diversity in the workforce enhances our investment capabilities\u2014whether that be in better understanding the end markets of a publicly traded company or helping to facilitate deal origination in private markets. As a firm, we partner with great nonprofit organizations to help foster the next generation of talent. Girls Who Invest, Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, the Toigo Foundation and the Greenwood Project are just some of the nonprofit organizations. These organizations aim to engage women early, oftentimes during high school and university, to foster that talent pipeline for our own industry. MB: We need more initiatives designed to change not just the player but transform the game. Traditionally, diversity efforts have focused on helping the player\u2014i.e., supporting women to develop through mentoring and training. To be clear, these initiatives can be useful steps; however, research has shown that the problem isn\u2019t that women aren\u2019t qualified or don\u2019t have the right aspirations, but that leaders must also look at processes such as recruiting, interviewing and career advancement, among others, to address how we provide unseen talent an opportunity to shine. Unless we look at the rules of the game, we are not going to see the improved outcomes that diversity can bring to a company\u2014the type of outcomes that we, as investors, are seeking. YC: In addition to recruitment, we are seeing companies introduce workplace diversity councils and networks, not solely for gender but for all types of diversity, such as racial/ethnic, sexual orientation, gender identity, disabilities. There are also many group activities focused on intersectionality as an individual\u2019s identity is multidimensional. With the growth in DEI efforts, it is becoming clearer that companies must commit dedicated resources. Frequently, members of the underrepresented groups will volunteer and take responsibility to change the organization\u2019s diversity culture, a role that is in addition to their day job. It is therefore important to understand not only what these companies are doing, but also how specifically the leadership teams are supporting these actions, for example, by recognizing and compensating the time and work contributed by employees involved. What role can large company shareholders play to change the situation? YC: At Calvert, we have always valued the power of proxy voting to hold boards accountable for their attention to diversity. While we have exercised this power for three decades, in recent years, we have placed an added emphasis on DEI to strengthen our proxy voting guidelines. For example, if a company has fewer than two women on the board, Calvert\u2019s guidelines would direct us to vote against reelecting the board directors who serve on the nomination committee. Thus, proxy voting can act as a potent tool in directly challenging board leaders who have failed to prioritize gender diversity. In addition, for companies in the U.S., the U.K., Australia and Canada, Calvert will vote against the nominating committee at companies that have fewer than two people from racially or ethnically underrepresented groups or that are less than 40% diverse. We will also vote against the chair of certain boards that do not disclose racial diversity information. \u00d7 \" Proxy voting can act as a potent tool in directly challenging board leaders who have failed to prioritize gender diversity. Another important area where shareholders can advocate change is transparency. For this reason, Calvert launched a campaign to facilitate EEO-1 disclosure in July 2020. The campaign targets the largest 100 U.S. companies and advocates for the disclosure of their EEO-1 reports, which are mandatory demographic reports collected by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of the U.S. government. At the beginning, only 16 companies were making their data public. We engaged the other 84 companies and, today, nearly 90 of our target companies publish the report. In fact, now, about half of S&amp;P 500 companies disclose, demonstrating the power of engagement. MB: As an equity investor in large public companies, it is important to evaluate every potential investee company\u2019s DEI approach to assess the risks and identify possible areas for engagement should we invest. For example, in the recent past, we engaged with a large spirits and wine company based in Europe. Despite being a global company, with a vast geographical footprint, particularly in emerging markets, the company had an all-white European board. We saw this as an opportunity to discuss the benefits of diversity in their leadership and urged the company to diversify their board. We were pleased to see that last year the company appointed a woman of Indian heritage with business experience from Asia, including Australia, Malaysia and Myanmar. Her nomination adds a unique perspective to the board, helps broaden the company\u2019s horizon and thinking and brings valuable business experience. These types of examples show that on a one-on-one basis, engagement can help to influence change. Joining forces with like-minded investors can also be highly effective to compel companies to change. To this end, in the U.K., Morgan Stanley Investment Management recently joined the 30% Club Investor Group, which comprises 42 financial investors representing more than \u00a320 trillion in assets under management. The group has engaged with U.K. companies for the last decade to improve board and executive gender representation. More recently, it has put out a race equity statement calling on companies to do more to improve race and ethnic diversity and will be engaging with investee companies to improve their DEI disclosure, strategy and outcomes. Working with groups such as these can be a powerful driver of change across a whole market or industry. We know this because we have seen it work. SH: If we step back to think about environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, the \u201cE\u201d and the \u201cG\u201d are often easier to measure and thus to highlight and talk about. We can count carbon reduction to assess climate impact, for example, and we can look at the proportion of women on boards when we think about corporate governance. The \u201cS\u201d is more difficult to measure, but it is a large part of what we are discussing here today. How do we treat our people? How does this impact the women in our workforce? The pandemic has brought home the importance of confronting \u201cS\u201d issues for corporate leaders. They have had a duty to ensure that workers are kept secure and safe. They have had to look at policies around caregiving, as it relates to childcare or even elder care, which affects the growing number of us who have aging parents. These types of \u201cS\u201d policies are not easy to measure, but have to be looked at and analyzed, which is what Marte, Yijia and I do as part of our jobs every day. For firms, this is critically important right now. In the aftermath of the pandemic, fewer women are returning to the workforce relative to men, a sign of sliding backward. Returning to the points made at the beginning of our discussion around the importance of gender diversity to performance outcomes, we need to ask ourselves: \u201cDo we really want to see women dropping out?\u201d Of course not. In order to remain competitive, we need to be harnessing that talent. By spending more time focused on the \u201cS\u201d issues, I think that women, companies and investors will all be better off. \u00d7 1 McKinsey &amp; Company. \u201cDiversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters.\u201d (May 2020). 2 Roc\u00edo Lorenzo, Nicole Voigt, Miki Tsusaka, Matt Krentz, and Katie Abouzahr, \"How Diverse Leadership Teams Boost Innovation\", Boston Consulting Group, 2018. 3 Linda-Eling, Lee Ric Marshall, Damion Rallis, Matt Moscardi. \u201cWomen on Boards: Global Trends in Gender Diversity on Corporate Boards,\u201d November 2015. 4 Calvert blog: Japan Makes Strides in Female Board Diversity https://www. calvert.com/impact.php?filter=chris__madden#japan-makes-strides-infemale-board-diversity.

Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments.

ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. \u00d7 Seema Hingorani Managing Director Strategic Client Relationships, Investment Talent Development and Diversity Initiatives Marte Borhaug Head of Sustainable Outcomes and Portfolio Manager International Equity Team Yijia Chen Vice President Calvert Research and Management", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/the-path-to-gender-diversity.html"}

{"content": "In a month where most global assets tumbled across both equities and fixed income, positioning in the bright spots of commodities and UK equities, all of which were up over the month, offered some cushion. As anticipated, markets took another leg lower. The S&amp;P 500 had the worst performance of the major developed markets, down -8.7% (USD), with the MSCI Europe holding up better, down -0.5% (EUR) after a relief rally1. After a brief reprieve in March, the MSCI Japan continued its downward trajectory, -2.7% (JPY)1. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index also fared worse at -5.5%1 (USD). The VIX reflected the volatility, spiking to 33 at month end1. Bonds underperformed equities, as the US 10-year Treasury yield continued to move higher to 2.9%1 by April end. \u00d7 Are investors underestimating Fed tightening? At 8.5%2, US headline inflation is at a 40-year high and continues to accelerate. Investors still appear to be underestimating the amount of tightening necessary to cool inflation. Given continued inflationary pressures from an ultra-tight US labour market, energy and food price increases, the terminal rate of the current hiking cycle should exceed consensus expectations and what markets are currently pricing. The Fed Fund futures are indicating a terminal Fed Funds rate of 3.25%3. We believe the risks remain skewed to the upside and expect a terminal rate of at least 3.50% is required to keep inflation under control. This points to further downside pressure on US treasury bonds. Europe is less exposed to rate rises compared with the US, but inflation is still running unacceptably high, exacerbated by exposure to Russia-Ukraine. Inflation: to settle at elevated levels Whilst inflation should eventually stabilise, in the short-term China\u2019s lockdowns are impacting supply chains. We believe inflation is likely to settle at elevated levels, above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, as deflationary trends over the past decade, such as globalisation reverse and commodity supply shortages sustain upward pressure on prices. This has implications on equities, as higher real yields and inflation act as headwinds to equity valuations and earnings. Tighter margins, given pressures on wages and input costs, may not be passed to the consumer, as they too take a hit from increasing oil and food prices. Investment Implications Given the uncertain environment and potential for spikes in volatility, we have maintained our defensive, low equity positioning since last month. Portfolios managed by the GBaR team which permit options, benefitted from our enhanced tail risk hedging strategy, as they pulled the portfolios further out of equities as markets fell. Towards the end of the month, we reconciled the options and the target equity weight, increasing these portfolios\u2019 equity weights to ensure they are in line. We made tactical changes, adding those which should benefit from the commodity theme, such as Brazil - a large commodity exporter. We are underweight Europe versus the US, due to the former\u2019s increased recession risk, given exposure to Russia-Ukraine conflict. We made adjustments to bond exposures, reducing duration, given further Fed tightening and potential downside for bonds. Eurozone equities We initially reduced eurozone equities in March and after the recent relief rally, moved from neutral to underweight in April. There appears to be limited upside for stocks and significant tail risks, including a potential consumption-led slowdown, rising inflation pressures and margin compression on equities. Brazilian equities We moved overweight Brazilian equities, which should benefit from persistently high commodity prices on a tight market and positive terms of trade. A peak in the Selic rate in 2H 2022 should also support earnings growth, while valuations and sentiment remain supportive, despite the rally year-to-date. Emerging market local debt We moved overweight short duration commodity-exporting high yielders. A selection of Latin American, South African and Indonesian high yielders are likely to benefit from positive terms of trade given the rally in commodities. A rollover of inflation is also likely to offer positive real yield. We expressed this through adding to the emerging market local debt basket. European high Yield We moved from overweight to neutral European high yield, moving into cash for now. We believe the risk-reward has turned negative after the recent aggressive tightening in spreads towards the 10-year average level, leaving them slightly rich compared with European investment grade spreads. US duration Whilst we briefly increased duration last month, we reversed this in April, moving from neutral to underweight. Given current inflationary trends, we believe the market is still pricing an excessively low Fed funds terminal rate. Additionally, as the effects of Quantitative Tightening manifest in supply and demand balances, risks to long-term yields remain skewed to the downside. US 10-year breakeven We moved overweight to neutral, through removal of TIPS and positioned in short dated 1-3 year US treasuries or cash. As TIPS have an average maturity of 7-8 years, this reduction is in line with our move to underweight duration. JPY/USD We moved underweight Japanese Yen relative to the US dollar. Despite the weakening Yen, the Bank of Japan is likely to remain reluctant to change their policy to support their currency, as Japan\u2019s recovery remains subdued. Furthermore, importers are selling the Yen to pay for increasingly expensive imports and exports remain constrained by supply chain disruptions in key industries. If this continues, real money selling could remain an issue. Industrial Metals For portfolios which held industrial metals through an ETF, we have removed the position and place this into cash for now.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser\u2019s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio\u2019s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio\u2019s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. \u00d7 Andrew Harmstone Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Manfred Hui Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Select Product(s) Right Click Edit", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/finding-bright-spots-amongst-dark-clouds.html"}
{"content": "March was another brutal month for financial markets, capping one of the worst quarters since the 1980s. The \u201csafe-haven\u201d status of government bonds, evident as Russia invaded Ukraine, proved ephemeral as the end of February rally quickly reversed and turned into a large March sell-off. Indeed, it did not take long for markets to realize the inflationary/stagflationary implications of the war and resulting sanctions on Russia. \u00d7 The negative growth implications were ignored as the new shock was going to exacerbate inflationary conditions already on the boil from an overheating global economy beset with supply chain disruptions. Market expectations of central bank rate hikes ratcheted higher, sending global bond yields spiraling upwards: the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield rose 90 basis points (bps) while the 2-year German government bond yield moved into positive territory for the first time since 2014. The U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed\u2019s) March meeting was notable in that it resulted in a massive increase in its year-end inflation and rates forecast, justifying the market\u2019s bearishness. The extent of the shift in monetary policy in 2022 is breathtaking by historical standards. Unlike in February, credit markets somewhat surprisingly outperformed governments with high yield (HY) and emerging market (EM) external debt spreads tightening meaningfully, correcting a significant portion of their February underperformance. HY and EM external lead the way, outperforming with spreads 30-64 bps tighter. Despite the negative implications of the war for the global economy, the U.S. dollar was mixed. European currencies fell modestly, and the Japanese yen was the big loser as the Bank of Japan (BoJ) made it clear it had no intention of following other central banks in tightening policy. EM currencies continued to do well, with Latin America leading the way. Reduced liquidity in financial markets was also noteworthy, exacerbating swings in prices, frequently on a daily basis. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date \uf065 Note: USD-based performance.

Fixed Income Outlook The Russian invasion of the Ukraine has further intensified existing imbalances in the global economy. The impact will likely be felt through an elongation and intensification of the inflation cycle and falling growth rates (though no recession). Inflation has moved up as have expectations through 2023. Commodity and food prices are likely to go higher still, exacerbating existing inflation problems, making central banks continue their hawkish jawboning and actions. The Fed is notable in this regard. It is very possible it hikes 250 bps this year as it front loads tightening while the economy is strong and shows its commitment to a credible anti-inflation strategy. There is absolutely no doubt in our minds that policy was too easy for too long (especially given the Covid-inspired fiscal policy response) and the Fed needs to \u201ccatch up\u201d and get policy to neutral as fast as possible. This may even necessitate multiple 50 bps rate hikes in contiguous months AND sooner than expected balance sheet runoff. So far markets have taken this well, with credit spreads widening relatively modestly and the dollar only marginally stronger. However, if inflation does not fall enough (yet to be defined, but probably no higher than the Fed\u2019s current end of year forecast), expect additional unexpected tightening next year, i.e., a much higher terminal Fed funds rate. This would raise the probability of a recession in 2023 and undermine credit assets. The Fed\u2019s hawkishness is mirrored across the globe. Indeed, EM central banks have been fighting inflation for over a year. In the case of Eastern Europe, rate hikes have accelerated in recent weeks as has the ECB\u2019s hawkish comments. This global synchronization of policy (outside of China and Japan) alongside stubborn inflation will, we believe, push yields higher globally. Even countries like Australia, where central banks have resisted raising rates, are experiencing very sharp increases in longer-maturity yields. Until inflation has peaked (or a recession is anticipated), which we will not know for several months, we expect yields to remain under upwards pressure. One reason central banks can be this hawkish is growth is strong. Although inflation is acting as a tax on households and businesses and yields are moving higher, labor markets and corporate profitability are strongly supporting spending. Thus, given the current level and trajectory of yields we do not anticipate a recession either this year or next. The earliest it could happen based on our analysis is 2024. This is a long way off and supports a more 1994 interpretation of this year\u2019s rate hiking cycle as one that will slow things down enough to contain inflation without throwing the U.S. or global economy into a recession. We have to keep in mind that the global economy is decelerating from a very high level. That said, regional issues will occur. The probability of economic underperformance is greatest in Europe and China/ ASEAN. The U.S. will likely remain the growth leader. As a result, corporate profitability is likely to be varied. The energy, commodities, and defense sectors are likely to benefit; Healthcare and Telecoms will be least affected, and for Utilities it will depend on their exact regulatory and commodity exposure. Both industrial and consumer sectors will be negatively affected, but at least they were experiencing strong demand going into the crisis. However, there is no denying that the impact will be negative, with European corporates more affected. That said spreads are wider than the beginning of the year with notable underperformance of Europe. Credit fundamentals are mixed. Credit quality is mixed in terms of profitability, earnings have likely peaked, and leverage and margins are plateauing. But balance sheets, liquidity and debt servicing capacity remain exceptionally strong. And, importantly, we still expect very benign defaults and more upgrades than downgrades. We therefore think corporate credit remains sound and would look to add to positions on pull backs. That said, due to central banks\u2019 new-found commitment to contain and reduce inflation over the next 18 months, growth will weaken and it will be important to differentiate those companies who can continue to thrive in such an environment. Active management is likely to be key to performance. We do maintain a preference at the margin for high yield over investment grade but that is very idiosyncratic and industry specific. EM outperformed recently. This is due to valuations, EM underperformed much of the last 12 months; big regional disparities, Latin America benefitting economically at the margin from the war (even if inflation cycle lengthens a bit); and, commodity exporters benefitting, like Brazil and South Africa. We think this trend is likely to continue. Country level analysis will be vital to uncover value as we expect markets to place an emphasis on differentiation amongst countries and credits. Developed Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW In March, repricing of central bank policy expectations resulted in a global sell-off in developed market rates. The movement included historic increases in front-end rates, a positive German 2-year yield for the first time since 2014, and 2-10s and 5-30s yield curves inversions in the U.S. Treasury market. Facing higher energy prices given the war in Ukraine, inflation figures remained elevated and surprised to the upside in many areas. Central bank policy was once again the dominating theme. Central bankers indicated to markets that despite everything going on in the world, from war to a resurgence in Covid cases, they are serious about tackling the inflationary pressure that still looms large and are willing to take the drastic measures necessary.1 OUTLOOK We still believe that inflation will continue to surprise to the upside. The war lingers on threatening energy prices and supply chain disruptions remain, and potentially are worsening, with lockdowns in China given Covid resurgence. Central banks are relatively limited on actions to combat inflation directly at the current moment. We expect central banks to continue normalizing policy; however, they may be forced to take a more cautious approach than they are now projecting if the war in Ukraine intensifies or if the market starts to price in expectations for a recession. We still have limited conviction on the direction of currencies. Emerging Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW Emerging markets debt (EMD) indices sold off notably across the board during the month as markets sought to digest the Russian invasion of Ukraine, further stress in the China property market, and the pricing in of an increasingly hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed). Inflationary pressures remain elevated in most EM countries with the commodity-price channel effects of the Russia/Ukraine conflict. EM central banks have continued reacting with orthodox monetary policy. U.S. dollar-denominated corporate debt,2 local sovereign debt, 3 and U.S. dollar- denominated sovereign debt also seeing negative returns.4 OUTLOOK We are optimistic on EMD as valuations appear to be well-compensating investors for the risk. The Russia/Ukraine war will continue to drive headlines and may continue for quite some time. Fundamentals are mixed and while Fed tightening is a concern, markets appear to be pricing that in somewhat aggressively. The growth and inflation dynamic remains critical. Country level analysis will be vital to uncover value as we expect markets to place an emphasis on differentiation amongst countries and credits. Corporate Credit MONTHLY REVIEW Credit spreads tightened in March with general market volatility calming after a rocky February. Over the month, markets reduced expectations that the impact would be systemic for markets outside the impacted region. Sector/corporate news in the month was limited to idiosyncratic news and speculation over the impact of increased cost inflation in the supply chain.5 The high yield market remained weak in the first half of March but strengthened in the final two weeks. Over the month, yields rose and spreads tightened and there was a brief period of inflows into the asset class, the latter of which has been exceedingly rare in the current environment.6 Global convertibles balanced between negative sentiment in the bond market from rising rates and improved sentiment in the equity on hopes that the Russia-Ukraine conflict may de-escalate. New issuance over the quarter was the second weakest first quarter on record, below only the first quarter of 2009, largely due to a weakening equity market.7 OUTLOOK Looking forward we see spreads likely to be rangebound. Markets are supported by technical demand, valuations look attractive relative to recent levels and expectations that the Russia/ Ukraine war is not systemic outside the region, leading to global default rates staying low. This is balanced by the expectation of supply and tighter financial conditions that are driving the yield curve flatter, potentially signalling an economic slowdown. Floating-Rate Loans The floating-rate corporate loan market experienced a smoother path than most of its index counterparts across the fixed income landscape. Technical conditions in the loan market were relatively balanced for the month. Fundamentals continued to showcase the health of corporate credit markets through the month.8 OUTLOOK We maintain our expectations for a strong year in loans as rising interest rates historically have been bullish for the asset class. Additionally, we remain in an appealing credit environment. As with all crises, it will take time for uncertainty to abate. In the meantime, this asset class has showcased its durability yet again. Securitized Products MONTHLY REVIEW Agency MBS underperformed again in March. Spreads are now materially wider than pre-pandemic levels as the market is anticipating the end of quantitative easing and likely the beginning of quantitative tightening, but agency MBS spreads could widen further as the Fed continues to reduce its purchases. U.S. Non-agency RMBS spreads were significantly wider across all residential sectors in March as nearly all risk assets cheapened given concerns about inflation, central bank policies and geo-political events. U.S. ABS spreads were also wider in March, but fundamental performance remains strong.9 OUTLOOK We believe the securitized market still offers a unique combination of low duration, attractive yield, and solid credit fundamentals. We remain constructive on securitized credit and cautious on agency MBS and interest rate risk. \u00d7 The views and opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Management team as of March 2022 and are subject to change based on market, economic and other conditions.

There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. \u00d7 Global Fixed Income Team Our fixed income investment capabilities are driven by eight specialized teams \u2013 Agency MBS, Emerging Markets, Floating-Rate Loans, High Yield, Investment Grade Credit, Municipals, Multi-Sector, and Securitized \u2013 which span the global fixed income capital markets.

{"content": "Company culture, the shared values and behaviors that define how employees collaborate to create value for the enterprise, remains an enigma in the field of investing. Analysts intuitively understand its influence on investment outcomes and nod knowingly when presented with examples of effective or bad cultures. But measuring culture is a subjective exercise that is open to wide interpretation, even among employees at the same company. Culture has defied quantification at a time when researchers are numerically modeling every factor that has an impact on investment performance. \u00d7 In the late 1970s, tangible investments were nearly twice those of intangible investments. Today, intangible investments are roughly one and a half times those of tangible investments. This shift has transformed the nature of business. We believe our economy\u2019s transformation from tangible to intangible assets is secular and early in its course. As a result, investors will increasingly recognize culture as a critical determinant of value creation. That means it will be the subject of critical analysis and measurement in years to come. Given this reality, we reviewed legacy frameworks to quantify culture and found them to be well intentioned but generally inconsistent. They were also far too broad in their scope. We believe a new approach can add value. We studied how KPIs have evolved, how they are used, and what impact they have had. Our goal is to simplify the complex topic and to create a standard set of tools that investors can use to evaluate a company\u2019s intangible assets.

McKinsey\u2019s 2020 report, \u201cDiversity Matters: How Inclusion Wins,\u201d finds that companies in the top quartile for gender diverse executive teams were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile.1 According to Boston Consulting Group research, companies with above-average diversity on their leadership teams generated higher revenue from innovation\u201419 percentage points more than at companies with homogenous leadership teams\u2014and delivered higher EBIT margins.2 Research by MSCI found that boards with higher levels of gender diversity tend to experience fewer instances of business misconduct, such as corruption, bribery and fraud.3 The findings are equally compelling for ethnic and cultural diversity. McKinsey\u2019s study found that the most ethnically diverse executive teams outperformed the least diverse executive teams by 36% in terms of profitability in 2019. In fact, according to its analysis, there continues to be a higher likelihood of outperformance difference with ethnicity than with gender.4 Testing for DE&amp;I is hard. The lack of data is a real problem. Shifting goal posts, national differences and varying regional regulatory developments all contribute to the complexity of pinning down what can be measured. For example, gender pay gap (GPG) data in the U.K. is useful insofar as it provides a high-level overview of gender inequality, but its lack of granularity and limitation in scope makes it difficult to diagnose why pay disparities exist. In the U.S., while companies are required to report intersectional diversity data captured by the mandatory Employer Information Report (EEO-1), only a handful of companies disclose this information publicly.5 Making things even harder, in many countries it is illegal for companies to ask employees to disclose their race and/or ethnicity, and many don\u2019t have GPG reporting requirements. The fact is women and minorities are underrepresented at senior levels of most companies and in the broader workforce across many industries. Other than the obvious negative impact on human capital development for women, there\u2019s the economic issue: the pay gap. The World Economic Forum 2021 \u201cGlobal Gender Gap Report\u201d shows the global wage gap is currently 37%, while the income gap (the ratio of the total wage and non-wage income of women to that of men) is close to 51%.6 It\u2019s not just gender. Black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups are typically underrepresented throughout organisations, and most acutely at senior levels. According to a study by Mercer, in the U.S., the most dramatic decrease in representation is among Black/African American employees, who make up 12% of support staff roles but account for a mere 2% of executive level positions.7 Taking the pulse. Of course, inclusion stretches beyond statistics and into culture. According to a global survey by Qualtrics, an \u201cexperience management\u201d specialist, only 37% of workers say their company culture has improved since the beginning of the pandemic, implying 63% see no improvement or worse.8 Investing in \u201cexperience management\u201d solutions helps managers and human resources leaders to listen to employees, allowing them to take insight-based action to improve employee experience and engagement. This goes beyond providing training to actively soliciting feedback and creating an environment of trust. Incentivising for outcomes. According to research by Deloitte, reviewing proxy statements between February 2020 and January 2021, fewer than 40% of Fortune 100 companies incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures in their executive incentive plans. Of those that had, social metrics were the most frequent, followed by environmental.9 Within social, DE&amp;I metrics were the most common \u2013 so it\u2019s a relatively good start for DE&amp;I \u2013 but in an absolute context, most companies are yet to embrace environment and social (E&amp;S ) incentives, meaning leadership lack accountability for delivery of DE&amp;I objectives. So how do we approach DE&amp;I with our holdings? It is hard to get a view from the outside, so in our opinion, direct engagement with management is the best route. Our DE&amp;I engagement checklist includes: Has the company conducted a comprehensive pay equity and pay gap analysis? Does management align DE&amp;I with executive compensation? If not, why? Does the company have a hiring policy requiring a gender diverse slate of candidates for all leadership positions (e.g., 30% must be female)? Does the company have a hiring policy ensuring candidates are not required to disclose past pay information? Does the company have processes in place to ensure job descriptions are gender neutral? Does the company regularly train recruitment professionals and interviewers to focus on more inclusive recruitment efforts? Does the company actively develop female talent through a leadership development programme or equivalent? Does the company provide sufficient flexible working and parental leave to both parents? Does the company use employee engagement surveys, and with what frequency? Does the company offer a \u201cReturnship\u201d programme for females following a career break? What is the return rate from parental leave? U.S. companies: Is EEO-1 representation data disclosed? If not, why? A focus on engagement leading to outcomes. With two of our global beverage companies, we have been pressing for some time to see the board diversify away from being all European to more representative of its underlying markets. We are pleased to see real change happening, given new appointments. On data, we engaged with one of our medical technology holdings to discuss a shareholder proposal \u2014which we supported\u2014calling for a report on racial justice and disclosure of EEO-1 gender and ethnic diversity data. Given the company reports EEO-1 data to the U.S. government, we questioned why it didn\u2019t disclose it publicly. It now plans to disclose some EEO-1 data as part of its new D&amp;I report. With another holding, the world\u2019s leading digital and management consultancy, we looked to understand how it expects to reach its targets of 50/50 workforce gender parity by 2025 and attain 30% women managing directors by 2025. To help get there, the firm targets that each of the U.S., the U.K. and South Africa operations have ethnic representation targets; the use of diverse candidate slates is standard, managers are accountable for promoting diversely and flexible working provisions are in place\u2014all of which we applaud. However, we challenged the company with our concerns about working conditions in its content moderation business and we will continue to monitor this. Where next? Along with pushing for data, better transparency, aligned incentives and credible pathways for change, our DE&amp;I engagements also encourage our portfolio companies to consider how greater diversity links to business strategy. Closer to home. Like our holdings, we are on our own journey. Today, just under a third of the investors on the team are female, from none a few years ago, and 46% of the combined Investor and Portfolio Specialist team is female. Of our eight managing directors, three are female.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy\u2019s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 Bruno Paulson Managing Director International Equity Team Marte Borhaug Head of Sustainable Outcomes International Equity Team Alistair Corden-Lloyd Executive Director Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/diversity-asking-difficult-questions.html"}
{"content": "One of the oldest investment axioms for market experts is to never set a price target and attach a date to when it happens. The market is a humbling beast that delights in making the supposed \u201csmart money\u201d look foolish. Anyone who is arrogant in the investment business is either too new or about to be colossally wrong. Yet as a portfolio manager of equity funds, I must have a market view. Quite simply, the concept of \u201cjust pick stocks and ignore the noise\u201d sounds great in theory. However, too much of a stock\u2019s return is explained by macro inputs to simply put on blinders regarding the market. The painful unwind of the uber growth stocks over the past six months has had far less to do with stock specific problems and a lot more to do with a massively shifting macro environment that is no longer willing to stomach sky high valuations. With that prelude, and 36 years of the market consistently reminding me of my place in its world, what follows is my best guess for the remainder of 2022. Overall, I remain cautious as we head into the summer, yet optimistic about a rally from the expected summer market lows through the end of the year. Regarding my cautious stance heading into the summer: In my opinion, we have not yet hit maximum growth scare hyperbole (\u201crecession coming, look out below\u201d). Here are some of the maximum growth scare signals we are watching for: VIX &gt;40\u2026. not there yet. GS Financial Conditions Index tighten to over 100\u2026. not there yet. Put/call ratio reflecting extreme investor anxiety\u2026. building. High yield spreads to Treasuries blowing out\u2026. not there yet. Fund flows turn very negative\u2026. not there yet. CTA trend-followers have all but given up on equities\u2026. in process. Typically, with this level of volatility in bonds, currencies and stocks, something breaks. Hedge fund blow-up? Debt default? Who knows? I think a maximum growth scare will happen when the Fed actually begins the more aggressive rate increases. I do suspect we are nearing a short-term bottom for the market: Stock buybacks are collectively the number one buyer of stocks. The window for stock buybacks will largely reopen, having been closed for much of April. Corporate fundamentals in the Q1 earnings season, overall, were simply too strong to scare off the bulls. Investor optimism is very low, and that is a contrarian indicator. With increased expectations of a hawkish Fed, investors could positively react to any more balanced-stance signal from Powell. The annual lows during a mid-term year have pretty consistently arrived in the summer. I continue to believe 4,050 is an attractive initial entry point for the S&amp;P 500 and 3,850 is a distinct possibility. Regarding being optimistic following a potential summer low and a buyer at that level: Corporate and individual balance sheets remain too strong for us to experience more than a growth \u201cscare\u201d. We do expect inflation to subside. Therefore, Wall Street is likely to, yet again, overestimate the degree of Fed tightening. If inflation subsides as recession fears fade, the setup for an equity market rally exists. However, at this juncture, it\u2019s premature to expect more than an oversold bounce. During a mid-term year, Q4 has historically been the best quarter, as the incumbent party refocuses on \u201cstimulus\u201d (passing out the candy) in front of the upcoming Presidential campaign. While the full year S&amp;P 500 return could be lackluster from the 4,778 level on January 1st, 2022, the upside potential from those targeted lows would be quite attractive. Yet, sadly, here is what I am highly confident will occur: Investors cumulatively won\u2019t be buyers into a summer low. Instead, they will hit the panic button to sell at exactly the wrong time. Here are our current thoughts regarding portfolio positioning: It\u2019s too late to buy defensives. The time to buy defensives is when the market is soaring and nobody wants them, as happened at the end of 2021. Our portfolios have been underweight growth stocks. That is changing, given the magnitude of growth underperformance relative to the market. Therefore, using defensive positions as a source of funds, we are actively preparing a list of quality growth stocks to potentially add into this next leg lower for the market, with the following characteristics: phenomenal long-term track records of profitability outpacing their peers. no fundamental problems in their businesses. down over 20%+ from their highs. reasonable (do not have to be cheap) valuations. While now is too early to pull the trigger, we do think that a great opportunity is nearing. \u00d7 Andrew Slimmon Head of Applied Equity Advisors Team Applied Equity Advisors Team Global Concentrated Portfolio MLNIX | Class I Global Core Portfolio MLMIX | Class I US Core Portfolio MUOIX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/equity-market-commentary-may-2022.html"}

{"content": "As the world gears up to tackle global warming, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydro power are at the forefront of solutions offered to avert a climate catastrophe. Yet half a century after the environmental case for nuclear power first became clear, it is making a comeback, as a way to fight climate change. \u00d7 Given the challenges in quickly scaling renewable energy sources like solar, not to mention the increased geopolitical concerns around energy independence, it appears policy makers are finally waking up to the promise of nuclear power. French president Emmanuel Macron recently announced a \u20ac1 billion package of funding in support of small nuclear reactors, in addition to a pledge to construct 14 new generation reactors.1, 2 Newly elected South Korean President Yoon Sukyeol is aiming for nuclear to account for 30% of total power generation, a reversal in policy from the previous president.3 Japan, home to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, recently restarted nuclear capacity.4 China intends to build more nuclear reactors over the next 15 years\u2014150 in total\u2014than the rest of the world combined has built over the last 35 years.5 \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Nuclear Lifecycle GHG Emissions Lower Than Wind or Solar \uf065 Source: UN Economic Commission for Europe, 2021, \u201cLife Cycle Assessment of Electricity Generation Options\u201d. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Nuclear Lifecycle GHG Emissions Lower Than Wind or Solar Source: UN Economic Commission for Europe, 2021, \u201cLife Cycle Assessment of Electricity Generation Options\u201d. Nuclear finally had a \u201cseat at the table\u201d during the recent UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow6 and, perhaps most importantly, the European Commission recently ruled that nuclear energy may potentially be included in the EU Taxonomy as a \u201cgreen\u201d sustainable activity, which may increase project financing for nuclear power.7 Public perceptions are changing as well: in 2018, only 37% of Democrats in the U.S. supported nuclear power; now a full 60% do.8 Who would have predicted a few years ago that Germany\u2019s decision to close down the last of its nuclear power plants would prompt the Washington Post editorial board to proclaim \u201cWhat a mistake,\u201d earlier this year?9 This says nothing of the more recent sharp U-turn in attitudes towards nuclear by many European governments as they revisit their reliance on Russian fossil fuels: Britain reversed plans to shut down its nuclear plants by 2030, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced an aim to increase the nuclear share of electricity from 15% to 25%.10 Belgium, which confirmed plans as recently as December of 2021 to close all nuclear reactors by 2025, similarly reversed course and decided to extend the life of its nuclear reactors an additional ten years.11 Below we discuss the benefits of nuclear power, including why we believe public fears are misguided, and how investors can gain exposure to this structural theme. As Lux Capital\u2019s Josh Wolfe has suggested, perhaps a re-branding of this \u201celemental\u201d power is needed to overcome legacy perceptions.12 It is time facts\u2014not fear\u2014drive our policy towards fighting climate change. Nuclear is carbon free, more reliable than other renewables, and possesses a strong safety track record, on par with solar and wind energy. Nuclear Is Net Zero Like wind and solar, nuclear energy produces zero direct carbon or GHG emissions. In fact, nuclear has lower GHG emissions than solar and wind when we include not just direct but indirect\u2014or Scope 3\u2014emissions over its lifecycle (Display 1). Over the past 50 years, nuclear power has reduced CO2 emissions by more than 60 gigatons, which is almost two years\u2019 worth of global emissions.13 Unlike solar and wind, nuclear has a proven track-record for historic decarbonization: three of the five fastest declines in the carbon intensity of energy occurred in countries that embraced nuclear power (Display 2).14 \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: Nuclear Can Drastically Alter Carbon Footprint \uf065 Source: The Breakthrough Institute (December 17, 2018).

Retrieved from https://thebreakthrough. org/issues/energy/the-green-new-deal-and-the-legacy-of-public-power. Nuclear Is Reliable Our energy system requires redundancy and reliability that is hard to achieve with renewables alone. Although solar, wind and hydro have a carbon footprint similar to that of nuclear, they are much less reliable, given their dependence on weather conditions and seasonal cycles that limit consistent use. While battery technology is improving, wind and solar are not reliable \u201cbaseload\u201d energy sources. Nuclear power is currently the only carbon-free energy source that can reliably deliver electricity, day or night, to service providers like hospitals or data centers 24/7, as illustrated by a higher capacity factor (92%) than any other energy sources including solar (25%), wind (35%) and natural gas (57%).15 Nuclear plants also have a relatively small land footprint. For example, plants in Germany require 500x less land than solar and 415x less land than wind,16 a factor which has recently caused \u201cGermans to fall out of love with wind power,\u201d17, 18 given land constraints and NIMBY opposition. Nuclear Is Safe Despite being carbon free, with a proven track record for historic decarbonization, nuclear power\u2019s share of the global primary energy mix remains unchanged since the early 1980s at a little over 4%.19 Why has the world been slow to adopt nuclear? Arguably the biggest misconception about nuclear power is safety. High-profile accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima have amplified long-standing fears around nuclear. Yet any serious analysis of energy safety would compare death rates per unit of energy produced across all sources of energy, including deaths brought on by accidents and pollution. Under this methodology, nuclear is one of the safest sources of energy in the world (0.07 deaths/TWH), on par with solar (0.02) and wind (0.04), and multiple magnitudes lower than coal (24.6), oil (18.4), or natural gas (2.8) (Display 3), according to research compiled by Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser of \u201cOur World in Data.\u201d Deaths resulting from nuclear energy are 99% lower than deaths from coal and 97% lower than deaths from gas.20 To provide context, deaths linked to the worst nuclear accident in history (Chernobyl) resulted in an estimated 4,000 premature deaths related to radiation exposure, according to the U.N.21 While this is an unthinkable tragedy, researchers have estimated that as many as 4.5 million people died in a single year (2019) from exposure to air pollution caused by fossil fuels.22 \u00d7 DISPLAY 3: Nuclear Safety Record on Par With Other Renewables \uf065 Source: Markandya &amp; Wilkinson (2007): Sovacool et al.

(2016). https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ death-rates-from-energy-production-per-twh What then explains the general public\u2019s fear of nuclear power? It would appear to us that it stems from a societal-wide case of \u201csalience bias,\u201d or the tendency to overweight prominent or emotionally striking events, while underweighting less remarkable but possibly more serious events.23 Deaths resulting from coal and other fossil fuels are much greater and sadly chronic, yet many would be hard-pressed to name the last coal-related death. Nuclear accidents, on the other hand, seem to be seared into the public consciousness, as Margaret Harding, a nuclear engineer at General Electric for 27 years, notes: \u201cYou say, \u2018Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima\u2019 and everybody instantly knows what they are.\u201d24 While there are clear safety risks with nuclear energy, tradeoffs matter. The fear of low-probability accidents, which resulted in relatively few deaths compared to other energy sources, should not stop us from advancing and improving nuclear energy in order to tackle climate change. In nearly every case that a country has shut down nuclear power plants, carbon-free electricity has been replaced with \u201cdirty\u201d power.25 For example, after Germany made the decision to shut down all of their nuclear power plants post- Fukushima, the country has witnessed the biggest rise in emissions since 1990, as the use of coal surpasses wind power to meet high electricity demand.26 As a result, Germany has now missed emissions targets for two straight years and has indicated it will likely fall short in the coming two years as well.27 Nuclear waste is a serious concern, but 90% of nuclear waste is low-level and only 1% radioactive.28 Three percent of the waste is considered \u201chigh-level,\u201d but contrary to popular belief, it is dense and relatively small: by some estimates, the nuclear fuel waste generated in the U.S. over the past 60 years would \u201cfit on a football field, stacked 20 feet high.\u201d29 It is estimated that an American\u2019s entire lifetime of electricity generated by nuclear power would produce long-term waste that fits in a soda can.30 Overcoming Costs Beyond public perception, another key hurdle faced by nuclear energy is cost, as illustrated by the total levelized cost of electricity per MWh.31, 32 But perhaps a carbon-free and safe form of energy that can operate at a greater capacity should be more expensive. Many experts have pointed out that the high cost of nuclear power plants are arguably a function of decades of stagnation and bad policies. To give one example, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission was created in 1975, yet as Stripe CEO Patrick Collison noted recently, since then, no new nuclear plants have ever reached operation.33 With regulatory red tape slowing the licensing process, it should be no surprise that costs have risen. Furthermore, incentives matter: the subsidies and tax breaks received by the different carbon- free sources of energy\u2014wind, solar, nuclear\u2014show a stark inequality. For example, in 2018 nuclear received a mere $13mn in federal tax incentives per unit of energy produced, while wind received over $2bn and solar over $3.3bn or 250x that of nuclear.34 Further, a wave of innovation in nuclear technologies is taking place all over the world, as entrepreneurs are seeking to solve a plethora of challenges, from using nuclear fission and nuclear fusion to generate electricity, to designing small modular reactors (SMRs).35, 36 Not only are SMRs designed to be significantly safer, but they will be much cheaper than current nuclear plants due to a smaller, simplified structure\u2014SMRs can fit in a 20-foot container yet power 200,000 homes at once37\u2014which allows them to be mass fabricated and assembled in factories, further driving down costs.38 \u00d7 DISPLAY 4: EM Leads New Nuclear Capacity Additions \uf065 Source: \u201cWorld Nuclear Performance Report 2021\u201d. \u00d7 DISPLAY 4: EM Leads New Nuclear Capacity Additions Source: \u201cWorld Nuclear Performance Report 2021\u201d. Emerging Markets Are Leading the Nuclear Build-Out Despite nuclear power being a reliable, safe, carbon-free source of energy, the biggest hurdle is political. For all the countries that are increasingly embracing nuclear power, Germany is targeting to phase out nuclear energy by 2022. Spain plans to phase out seven nuclear power reactors by 2035. The U.S. retired five reactors during 2021 and the Diablo Canyon Power Plant, the last in California, is poised to shut down in 2025. In fact, nuclear power output in advanced economies was down 6% from 2019 levels at the end of last year.39 In contrast, several emerging markets countries\u2014including China, South Korea and India\u2014which are earlier in their build-out of energy infrastructure, have demonstrated a much greater willingness to embrace nuclear energy (Display 4). Nuclear power output grew by 5% in 2021 and ended the year at 8% above 2019 levels.40 China has emerged as the world\u2019s new champion for nuclear energy. President Xi Jinping considers nuclear as a key part of the \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d strategy, which is designed to bolster high-tech industries. China also announced the construction of the world\u2019s first commercial small modular reactor in South China\u2019s Hainan Province. After completion, the reactor will have an annual power generation capacity of 1 billion kilowatt hours, meeting the energy demands of 526,000 homes.41 Our Outlook and Investing in a Nuclear Future Given the challenges of achieving \u201cnet zero\u201d through our current global energy mix, we expect nuclear to become a more favored alternative and play a key role in coordinated global energy transition. As investors in emerging and frontier markets, we believe nuclear power can play a role in helping developing countries achieve energy security without the need to rely on fossil fuels. In order to gain exposure to this theme, we invested in the world\u2019s largest, lowest-cost, and cleanest nuclear fuel (uranium) mining company over three years ago (see the following case study). There are an increasing number of listed vehicles for investors to gain exposure to nuclear power, be it large-cap nuclear fuel mining companies, or a number of listed uranium ETFs. Several hurdles remain including safety, cost and public support. But just as COVID led to seismic changes in how we work, perhaps climate concerns and geopolitical events will revive support for nuclear power: a safe, reliable and carbon- free source of energy. Case Study: ESG Opportunities in the Nuclear Fuel Cycle The Next Gen Emerging Markets fund explores overlooked markets to seek out high quality business models. We avoid businesses that fail to integrate ESG considerations into their strategic planning or risk mitigation. We see actively engaging management teams on ESG risks as a vital step in our investment process. Given our long-held view that nuclear energy will need to play a larger role in efforts to fight climate change, in 2019 we became shareholders of a Kazakhstan-based company, which is the world\u2019s leading producer and supplier of natural uranium, the main fuel source for nuclear power plants. As with most mining operations, conventional uranium mining can have harmful impacts on the environment and society writ large. This company utilizes a mining process referred to as \u201cin-situ recovery\u201d (ISR), which allows mining to occur with minimal amounts of physical excavation (as opposed to typical open pit mining) due to a closed-system water pumping and recycling method (Display 5). ISR is widely considered to be the safest and cleanest method of extraction given it is a closed system which requires no workers to go underground, nor blasting of rock or open cast digging. In October 2021, we engaged with the company\u2019s CFO and head of environmental safety on a number of material issues, including: emissions, energy consumption, water management, waste management, lifecycle management, worker safety, employee diversity, and board compensation as it relates to ESG metrics. While the company is still working to strengthen its ESG reporting, it already has many sustainability considerations embedded into its business model. The two-way dialog led to a number of follow-up items and we plan to continue our active engagements with the company in the coming quarters and years in order to track and measure their progress on key issues. We believe the company is well-positioned to benefit from the global efforts to transition to a lower carbon future. This example is provided for illustrative purposes only. There is no assurance that the engagements will be successful and/or result in positive investment outcomes. \u00d7 DISPLAY 5: In Situ Recovery (ISR) Mining Process \uf065 Source: Department for Energy and Mining, the Government of South Australia, In situ recovery (ISR) mining.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Stocks of small-and medium- capitalization companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets, and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more-established companies. By investing in investment company securities, the portfolio is subject to the underlying risks of that investment company\u2019s portfolio securities. In addition to the Portfolio\u2019s fees and expenses, the Portfolio generally would bear its share of the investment company\u2019s fees and expenses. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). ESG Strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. 1 Alderman, L. (2022, February 10). France announces major nuclear power buildup.

{"content": "The global economic environment remains highly uncertain. On top of the unknown path and outcome of the war in Ukraine, many parts of the world are faced with record levels of inflation, rising interest rates and ongoing COVID challenges, most notably in China where the recent lockdowns affect supply chain costs and create delays. As a result, economic growth expectations have been lowered, most notably in Europe and China. Capital markets volatility across all asset classes has been extreme and is expected to continue. Given a moderated growth outlook and higher interest rates, real estate returns could potentially be lower over the next few years but still outperform other asset classes. Investor capital flows should remain steady, attracted to the durable, inflation-hedging income characteristics, which in turn should continue to support strong pricing for a narrower definition of core real estate. Class A residential and industrial markets will likely continue to outperform, while the office and retail sectors\u2019 performance will likely remain challenged and highly bifurcated. Above Trend but Slower Growth GDP forecasts have come down due to lower demand as a result of higher prices, weaker market sentiment and squeezed consumer incomes. Despite this, real growth rate projections over the next two years still compare relatively favorably against the last 10 years (3.1% in the U.S., 2.7% in Europe and above 5% in Asia). Europe\u2019s growth is likely to be more impacted by the war in Ukraine compared with the U.S. and Asia given its weaker macroeconomic conditions, greater dependency on Russia for energy, more supply chain linkages in key industries (e.g., autos) and greater trade exposure. Asia\u2019s growth is likely to be less impacted as most countries are in the early-to-mid cycle phase of their economic expansion (due to stricter COVID policies), have less dependence on Russian oil, lower inflation and higher current account surpluses (compared with past crises). However, COVID-lockdowns have the potential to lower growth in China (and for the region) and further disrupt global supply chains. Growth in the U.S. should remain above-trend, helped by a healthy labor market (dynamic job market, rising participation rates and wage increases), de-levered consumer balance sheets and a strong capex cycle. Elevated and Sticky Inflation Rising energy and food prices, exacerbated by the war, has added more pressure on already high inflation prints in many countries, most notably in the U.S. (6.8%), Europe (6.8%) and the U.K. (6.7%). Governments in Europe and Asia are planning to reduce the burden from energy prices on consumers via tax reductions, subsidies and targeted income support measures. While higher energy and food prices will continue to affect all regions, MSREI believes that U.S. inflation may be more persistent relative to the other regions given higher wages and housing costs. From a real estate investing standpoint, it will be even more important to focus on sectors and opportunities where rents can grow faster than costs and where market fundamentals are more resilient to a pullback in consumer spending. Sectors best positioned to outperform in this environment include those with the strongest secular tailwinds, notably industrial and residential. Steeper Interest Rate Increases and Accelerated Unwinding of QE While Central Banks have noted the downside risks to economic growth stemming from the war in Ukraine, they have placed a higher priority on addressing inflation and therefore have adopted a more hawkish stance on monetary policy. Facing an unprecedented macro environment that includes supply chain issues, economic sanctions, war and unparalleled inflation, the Fed is expected to reduce the size of its balance sheet by $1.1T per year and aggressively raise interest rates. Morgan Stanley Research is anticipating a 50bps hike in May and in June, with additional 25bps hikes at all subsequent meetings through mid-2023, with the hiking cycle ending at 3.125%. \u00d7 Display 1 GDP Forecasts have Weakened \uf065 Source: Morgan Stanley Research, data as of April 9, 2022 \u00d7 Display 1 GDP Forecasts have Weakened Source: Morgan Stanley Research, data as of April 9, 2022 Display 2 CPI Forecasts have Increased \uf065 Source: Morgan Stanley Research, data as of April 9, 2022 \u00d7 Display 2 CPI Forecasts have Increased Source: Morgan Stanley Research, data as of April 9, 2022 Display 3 Cap Rate Spreads Trending Below Historical Averages \uf065 Source: NCREIF, PMA, MSCI, Bloomberg, MSREI Strategy, data as of March 2022 \u00d7 Display 3 Cap Rate Spreads Trending Below Historical Averages Source: NCREIF, PMA, MSCI, Bloomberg, MSREI Strategy, data as of March 2022 Outside the U.S., the Bank of England started to hike rates last year and is expected to continue in the first half of 2022, but may then decide to pause as pinched consumer incomes start to impact economic growth in the second half of the year. In Europe, markets are expecting more than two rate increases in 2022 and accelerated winding down of the ECB\u2019s asset purchases this year. In Asia, the Reserve Bank of Australia has shifted to a more hawkish tone, with Morgan Stanley Research now expecting rate hikes totaling 250bps through the end of 2023. South Korea is also expected to raise its rates by 160bps through year-end 2023. Overall higher policy rates have already begun to flow through to higher real estate borrowing costs in certain markets, including the U.S., U.K., Australia and South Korea. Given the expected magnitude of interest rate increases, MSREI believes that the weight of capital targeting real estate may not be enough to offset an increase in cap rates resulting from higher borrowing costs and significantly compressed yield spreads. As a result, investors will need to search for opportunities to drive higher income growth in order to offset higher cap rates and keep values from declining. Shifting Longer-Term Secular Trends as a Result of the War The war\u2019s longer-term de-globalization impacts on trading relationships, on-shoring/near-shoring trends, overall input costs and supply chains, may result in prolonged higher inflation and interest rates in some parts of the world, shifting trade routes and may create a new set of market winners and losers. A potentially stronger and more integrated Europe driven by fiscal stimulus to build out energy and defense infrastructure may lead to an above-trend, medium-term growth outlook. In the meantime, heightened political tensions and a potentially more fractured relationship between the U.S. and China may lead to decoupling in some spheres (e.g., technology), potentially causing a decrease in trade and a greater focus on maintaining buffer supplies of critical inventories in both regions. A shift to bi-polar and multi-polar economic and political relationships may create demand for more localized technology, research and development, spurring jobs in markets with access to that talent, while shifting trade patterns and re-shoring/near-shoring trends may benefit some industrial markets at the expense of others. \u00d7 Display 4 Despite Prevailing Uncertainties, Near and Long-Term Macro Implications are Beginning to Emerge \uf065 \u00d7 Display 4 Despite Prevailing Uncertainties, Near and Long-Term Macro Implications are Beginning to Emerge Flight to Quality More Pronounced Given the mix of macroeconomic unknowns discussed above and heightened market volatility, MSREI believes investors will need to follow a more cautious investing approach and adopt a more restricted definition of core real estate from a country, sector and location perspective. This could lead to lower return expectations for buyers of \u201ctrue core\u201d investments and the potential for transaction volumes to fall from last year\u2019s highs due to a widening gap between seller and purchaser expectations. Additionally, higher real estate financing and hedging costs may result in a smaller and narrower buyer universe. Property Sector Fundamentals and Investment Strategy Despite the shifting market environment, MSREI believes that continuing to focus on opportunities in the higher growth industrial and residential sectors, while staying cautious on the retail and office sectors, will continue to deliver strong performance. However, within those high growth segments, investment strategies and market selection need to be more nuanced given the secular shifts across the macro landscape. Specifically, MSREI believes investors should target locations that are more resilient to a pullback in occupier and investor demand and that benefit from demographic and supply chain shifts as this may support enough rent growth to offset rising costs and potentially higher cap rates. Industrial \u2013 Diverse Set of Demand Drivers, Fewer Affordability Constraints. Development Strategy Most Attractive Industrial markets around the world continue to exhibit extremely low levels of vacancy generating record rent growth in most global locations. Despite the big uptick in rents, other supply chain costs have increased by an even greater amount (e.g., spot ocean container freight costs up 200% yoy), as a result rents still remain a relatively small fraction of the overall supply chain (5-10%), suggesting some further upside, particularly in markets in Asia and Europe which have not seen as much rent growth. Additionally, third-party logistics, retailer and wholesaler margins are yet to be materially impacted by rising costs, suggesting rent affordability remains manageable. Squeezed consumer incomes, however, may challenge the pass through of these higher costs which, combined with higher supply, may lead to slower rent growth over the next couple of years, particularly in secondary markets with fewer barriers to new construction. As mentioned above, potential supply chain shifts from de-globalization may alter relative market attractiveness. Within the U.S., re-shoring of semi-conductor and chip production may benefit fabrication locations such as Phoenix, Austin and Columbus, near-shoring manufacturing to Mexico should benefit border markets like San Diego and El Paso, while a focus on just-in-case supplies of crucial inventories could benefit markets like Atlanta and Dallas among others. \u00d7 Display 5 Disciplined Execution of Current Investment Strategies \uf065 \u00d7 Display 5 Disciplined Execution of Current Investment Strategies Residential \u2013 Surge in Fundamentals should Moderate as Demand/Supply Rebalance The residential rental sector has historically offered the greatest inflation protection, with a short-term lease structure that enables regular rent resets and growth tied to wages which typically tracks inflation. Additionally, rising mortgage rates should support continued strong residential rental demand, specifically in segments that target renters by choice. With higher energy and food prices threatening affordability, MSREI believes it will be critical to target markets that continue to benefit from demographic shifts and have the strongest income growth potential to keep affordability ratios at reasonable levels. Similar to the industrial sector, where shifting preferences to on-line shopping as a result of COVID have fueled demand, residential preferences in the U.S. have shifted with suburban, sunbelt and larger accommodations seeing stronger occupancy levels. However, over the past 12 months, there has been some reversion back towards urban or higher-density suburban areas, as well as gateway markets, following the return-to-office shift. Supply is also a risk in the residential sector, more so in exurban locations, but again, due to rapidly rising construction costs and supply chain delays, existing projects may be insulated against this risk for longer. \u00d7 Display 6 Historically Tight Industrial Vacancy has Translated into Record Rent Growth \uf065 Source: CoStar, PMA, MSREI Strategy, data as of February 2022 \u00d7 Display 6 Historically Tight Industrial Vacancy has Translated into Record Rent Growth Source: CoStar, PMA, MSREI Strategy, data as of February 2022 Office \u2013 Significant Bifurcation in Performance Significant uncertainty remains over future occupier working models, although Europe and Asia are further along in the return-to-office timeline compared to the U.S. Broadly, MSREI expects to see lower demand in the future compared to pre-COVID levels and a greater focus by occupiers and investors on quality, amenities, ESG compliance and micro location. These preferences are reflected in current absorption, rent and pricing trends. Retail Similar to the office sector, the retail market has become more bifurcated, with convenience and experiential formats continuing to outperform older, less relevant assets in less-trafficked locations. Retail exhibits the highest yield of the main property sectors, and has begun to attract investor interest resulting in cap rates stabilizing or even compressing for the best quality centers and locations. Potentially more exposed to high inflation and an economic slowdown induced by the impact of squeezed consumer incomes on discretionary spending, MSREI believes it will be important to remain very selective when deploying capital in this sector. \u00d7 Display 7 Target Residential Opportunities in High Growth Markets \uf065 Source: OECD, MSREI Strategy, data as of February 2022 \u00d7 Display 7 Target Residential Opportunities in High Growth Markets Source: OECD, MSREI Strategy, data as of February 2022 Display 8 Regional Differences in Work-From-Home \uf065 Source: Kastle Return-to-Work Office Barometer, Google Mobility Trends, PCA, MSREI Strategy, as of March 2022 \u00d7 Display 8 Regional Differences in Work-From-Home Source: Kastle Return-to-Work Office Barometer, Google Mobility Trends, PCA, MSREI Strategy, as of March 2022 Alternative Sectors Investors are increasing allocations to alternative asset types, particularly healthcare and sectors linked to industrial and residential. Life science fundamentals remain extremely strong with vacancy rates near zero in prominent clusters, attracting capital and keeping yields at record-low levels. However, new development and office-to-lab conversions are increasing supply levels. Senior living fundamentals are accelerating, supported by aging baby boomers. Supply levels are lower compared with pre-COVID levels and yields are relatively higher than other healthcare sectors, partially due to higher operating risk. Student housing offers an attractive yield spread to multifamily, thanks to stable and countercyclical demand and reduced supply levels. Self-storage fundamentals have also been very strong due to increased housing demand and above average business demand. Lastly, leisure hotels that don\u2019t depend on international, business-transient or group travel continue to recover strongly, with RevPAR ahead of pre-COVID levels in U.S. markets. However, the durability of that strong performance may be challenged given headwinds to consumer spending and a transition back to a more normalized share of international outbound travel as COVID restrictions are lifted abroad. Outside the U.S., the recovery in hotel performance has lagged due to COVID-related lockdowns and travel restrictions. \u00d7 Display 9 Less Capital = Wider Retail Cap Rate Spreads \uf065 Source: Green Street Advisors, PMA, MSREI Strategy, data as of March 2022 \u00d7 Display 9 Less Capital = Wider Retail Cap Rate Spreads Source: Green Street Advisors, PMA, MSREI Strategy, data as of March 2022 Display 10 Alternatives Sector* Investment Share \uf065 *Includes self-storage, student housing, senior living, data centers Source: Real Capital Analytics, MSREI Strategy, data as of March 2022 \u00d7 Display 10 Alternatives Sector* Investment Share *Includes self-storage, student housing, senior living, data centers Source: Real Capital Analytics, MSREI Strategy, data as of March 2022 Conclusion MSREI believes that the shifting and more volatile macro environment will support attractive investment opportunities for discerning investors. The ability to reallocate capital between and within regions and sectors to take advantage of differing underlying growth drivers and central bank policies should differentiate managers. MSREI believes local market perspective, knowledge, presence and relationships, combined with the ability to actively manage assets to drive NOI growth, will be more critical than ever to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns. \u00d7", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/2022-global-real-estate-outlook-revisited.html"}

Forecasts/estimates are based on current market conditions, subject to change, and may not necessarily come to pass. Source: Gartner, Jeffries Research August 2021. The total DITS addressable market (TAM) estimates have ranged between US$500bn to upwards of US$1tn in 2021, compared to more than US$4tn global IT TAM (which includes hardware, software, services, communication) and US$1tn of dedicated global IT Services.1 According to Gartner, IT spending is expected to increase by low- to mid-single digits while DX spending is estimated to grow between 15-19% on the basis of Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). With segments such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR), and virtual/remote workspaces growing more than 30% CAGR,2 we believe this will remain a structural thematic on investor\u2019s radar. We have in fact added this theme to our portfolio after following DITS for some time. But why now, some may ask? The Covid-19 outbreak accelerated the corporate demand to digitalize. The impact of this pick up has been a significant increase in the organic demand environment, to the point where we believe the longer-term demand will likely be driven substantially higher from new digital native solutions. The expected revenue growth from this theme should drive strong profitability; note that this structural theme is complimentary to the hardware/semiconductor industry. The following is a simple \u201creal life\u201d example in the new digital world. Consider an airline that wishes to: Create a seamless reservation system independent of outside travel agencies; Integrate Covid-19 vaccination certificates online within its app; Offer automated check-in procedures in coordination with airports via face recognition, issue and verify boarding passes baggage tagging; Offer auto-routing of misplaced baggage efficiently, optimizing costs and time. This simple example is actually a complex issue without an easy solution. Number 1 is a must-have requirement, while number 2 starts to differentiate the company. Numbers 3 and 4 then creates a significant point of differentiation from competitors. This is where the DITS firms become an important part of the solution. In our opinion, the pure digital native companies are better positioned to build these types of solutions as they are not encumbered by any legacy businesses. Greater complexity requires an engineering team capable of dealing with that complexity, including a need to develop strong upskilling programs, maintain best-of-breed talent attraction and retention capabilities, all complemented by an attractive corporate culture. In our view it is critical to find the right companies that can hire and nurture strong talent pools, maintain high retention rates, sustain high utilization rates of 75%- 80% (i.e. maintain spare capacity), aim for high organic growth rates, and establish high-teens to low-20s operating margins. Geographical cost arbitrage is also a factor in the equation. We believe the successful company needs to get comparable or better talent at cheaper than customer location pricing. In that scenario everyone wins\u2014customers are happy (high-quality work at lower prices), employees are happy (intellectually challenging high-quality work at better than comparable local remunerations), and the company itself makes strong profits (cost arbitrage of talent to produce high-quality offerings) in a structurally growing revenue pie. Two essential factors are the relative \u201cbrand strength\u201d of these firms, and the geographical talent availability. With respect to branding, firms need to command good relative placement within peer sets to attract top talent. Typically, their internal work cultures, remuneration, capability, and talent fostering form this brand power. If done right, there is a significant \u201csoft moat\u201d that gets built on three foundational elements for successful companies. Assuming competitive remuneration within the peer set is a given, these firms are able to: Generate enough brand pull for talent to join; Provide positive employee-oriented cultures to help retention; Offer enough upskilling and opportunities for each employee to grow as a professional. In our process, these soft moats combine with some hard numbers\u2014the bench size vis-\u00e0-vis the customer slate size, and the bench utilizations\u2014which are additional key parameters for us to assess brand strength. Our guiding principle is that bench strength needs to be right-sized relative to the business opportunity, optimally utilized at all points, ultimately providing differentiation of opportunities across multiple skill sets for each individual employee to grow. It is interesting to note that firms delivering on all of these foundational elements are typically naturally strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) companies, with social and governance factors being the standouts. This is important to our team, and our firm. As for talent recruitment, the key players are centered in India, China, Brazil, Eastern Europe, ASEAN, and the U.S.\u2014with the majority based in Emerging Markets. Finally, there is a pyramidal structure when it comes to the industry. On the base are several traditional IT outsourcers who are trying to develop digital capabilities (traditional Indian IT players), with the middle section occupied by more global companies. The top of the pyramid has fewer players, including some of our portfolio holdings. There is also a set of firms that offer IT consulting and strategy work alongside IT services. The work at the top end is more structural, premium and lower volume, while at the base it is more commoditized with high volumes. Business consulting may or may not be a part of the DITS offering, but if offered, tends to be premium in nature. We see a \u201csweet spot\u201d in the middle-high section of the pyramid, with a premium footprint where scaling up is much faster with good margins. On this part of the pyramid, the pure plays are smaller in number\u2014and this is where we focus exclusively. Within this construct, we believe our holdings are the best-placed players due to their premium positioning, and their stage in the companies\u2019 development cycle, positioned in the sweet spot. We have also invested into India digital IT specialists, which in our opinion has the right DNA with a smaller relative size that enables them to scale up structurally and join the sweet spot. Our view is that these firms generally have the right kind of leadership teams, operating spaces, and moat characteristics that can potentially lead to a sustainably high Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) (20%+) with strong, repeatable revenue growth, all of which the Emerging Markets Leaders Strategy finds highly attractive. \u00d7 DOWNLOAD EMERGING MARKETS LEADERS FOCUS: DIGITALIZATION .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:fit-content; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Vishal Gupta Managing Director, Portfolio Manager, Emerging Markets Leaders Strategy Emerging Markets Equity Team Arun Kapoor Vice President, Emerging Markets Leaders Analyst Steve Sun Executive Director, Emerging Markets Client Portfolio Manager", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/emerging-markets-leaders-focus-digitalization.html"}

{"content": "Morgan Stanley\u2019s house view on the global economy is constructive but recognizes that investment returns from traditional asset classes may be potentially more difficult to come by than in the more recent past. Public markets have delivered remarkable performance over the past few years, but we expect that returns may be lower and volatility higher going forward. It is no surprise therefore that the interest in Alternatives and Private Markets continues to grow. Of course, Alternatives and Private Markets are not homogeneous and offer a diverse set of investment opportunities with varying return and risk profiles.1 Within the space, we see several changes brought about by shifting market dynamics, through product design and innovation, and even changes in investor priorities and conscience. In the following article, we discuss some of these dynamics which we believe may provide attractive investment opportunities and investors should be aware of. Private Equity \u2013 Changing Secondary Market Dynamics Private equity represents approximately 11% of the average portfolio allocations. Despite almost tripling in size since the mid-2000s (see Display 1), one could argue that this level of adoption still appears below the optimal exposure given the asset class\u2019s attractive performance. Increasing duration and the associated illiquidity remain key reasons why this allocation gap persists. However, there are solutions available within the private equity industry to check, or reverse, this upward trend in duration and allay investors\u2019 concerns about increasing their allocation to the relatively long holding periods. \u00d7 Display 1 Secondaries Volume vs. PE Unrealized NAV ($B) \uf065 Source: Preqin, data as of 31 March 2022 \u00d7 Display 1 Secondaries Volume vs. PE Unrealized NAV ($B) Source: Preqin, data as of 31 March 2022 In the early 2000s, the secondary market was primarily a tool for large limited partners (\u201cLPs\u201d), such as endowments, to obtain liquidity for their portfolios. However, we are witnessing a significant shift in the use of the secondary market and attitudes about the sector have shifted tremendously in the past decade. These markets are no longer viewed solely as vehicles for LPs to provide liquidity. Rather, they have evolved to enable complex general partner (\u201cGP\u201d)- led restructurings of mature funds and become an important part of the strategy for many private equity and venture capital funds.2 GPs have a significant amount of capital locked up in funds. Along with an increased volume of, and narrowing spreads in, secondary markets, longer holding periods have led to a huge growth in GP-led secondaries. These transactions now represent over 50% of the secondary market transactions (Display 2). The motivations for GP-led deals are different from traditional LP secondaries. Rather than focusing on liquidity, GPs use secondaries as an avenue to preserve the assets they want to maintain while addressing the needs of their investors. Thus, when a GP has an asset that the fund partners want to keep owning but is feeling pressure to return capital to its LPs, using a secondary with a continuation fund is an attractive option while it may provide investors with an interesting set of attractive investments. This solution may allow new investors to gain access to carefully selected high quality assets, with revised favorable terms, in deals with a shorter duration, potential for compelling IRRs and less of a j-curve (Display 3). \u00d7 Display 2 Annual Transaction Volume ($B) \uf065 Source: Global Secondary Market Review, Jefferies, January 2022 \u00d7 Display 2 Annual Transaction Volume ($B) Source: Global Secondary Market Review, Jefferies, January 2022 Display 3 Potentially Beneficial Solution For All Parties Involved \uf065 For illustrative purposes only.

The Appeal of Hybrid Private Investments From work/life arrangements to the energies used in our cars, demand for hybrid solutions is everywhere, including investments. Indeed, we see many investors transitioning to more hybrid structures in an effort to achieve their investment goals. Similar to the growth of customization as a way to refine investment solutions over the last two decades, we are now also seeing investment solutions adopt a more hybrid approach to their structure and/or investment universe. Investors are seeking combinations of investment features such as equity-like returns with traditional bond-like characteristics and thus looking at opportunistic alternative funds. These tend to be less constrained by traditional metrics, guidelines and mandates, investing across capital structures and into more niche investment opportunities. They may offer attractive risk/return characteristics thanks to the freedom of their mandate, potentially providing complementary risk/ return profiles to traditional portfolios, public equity diversification, stable returns and alpha/growth.3 The current environment is auspicious to these less constrained funds. They have the opportunity to identify mispriced assets across a spectrum of opportunities and determine the best investment method, presenting an attractive entry point for investors. Potentially less well understood than traditional investments though, and generally less liquid, care must be taken when evaluating an investment in hybrid funds. Partnering with a specialist is therefore key. In addition to opportunistic alternative funds, traditional asset classes such as fixed income offer new hybrid funds that have the potential to deliver enhanced yields over core fixed income (see Display 4), thanks to hybrid features such as mezzanine positions and floating interest rates offerings, as well as increased access to private credit solutions (e.g., middle-market direct lending and consumer lending). Their hybrid attributes are particularly attractive for investors who can accept some illiquidity in exchange for enhanced and differentiated yields. In addition to positive real yields, these fixed income solutions may also offer downside risk mitigation for public equity exposure, which is now less available from traditional fixed income securities. \u00d7 Display 4 Public vs Private Credit Risk/Return Profile \uf065 Source: Bloomberg Barclays High Yield index, S&amp;P Leveraged Loan Index and Cliffwater Direct Lending Index.

Data as of 31 December 2021. As a consequence of the environment and these features, there appears to be significant growth particularly in private credit. On the supply side, borrowers continue to look to the private markets. Equally, borrowers value the adaptability and partnership of private lenders, often the only\u2014or the lead\u2014investor in deals. From a demand standpoint, the global search for yield continues. Today, it also includes a demand for assets that can hedge inflation and protect capital in untested market environments. As a result, investors are increasing their allocations to the asset class (Display 5), achieving differentiation through the types of private credit chosen and other sources such as geographic diversification. Private credit still offers relatively high spreads over public markets (Display 6), as well as covenants (lender protection), and floating rate or asset-based inflation protection. It is also likely to continue to exhibit low volatility due to its less liquid nature. \u00d7 Display 5 AUM of Funds Primarily Involved in Private Debt Direct Lending Has Grown Tenfold in Past Decade \uf065 \u00d7 Display 5 AUM of Funds Primarily Involved in Private Debt Direct Lending Has Grown Tenfold in Past Decade Display 6 Differing Credit Source Returns % \uf065 Source: BofA Securities, Bloomberg, Clarkson, Cliffwater, Drewry Maritime Consultants, Federal Reserve, FTSE, MSCI, NCREIF, FactSet, Wells Fargo, J.P.

ESG, as a topic, is now mainstream, it is no longer something just additional. Risks are being considered across investments, companies are being required to address ESG issues, activities are being targeted and investors are willing to divest if ESG issues are not addressed appropriately. \u00d7 Display 7 Attitudes Toward ESG Risks and Opportunities, % of Respondents \uf065 Source: PwC 2021 Global Investor Survey \u00d7 Display 7 Attitudes Toward ESG Risks and Opportunities, % of Respondents Source: PwC 2021 Global Investor Survey According to the placement agent Campbell Lutyens, $183 billion is being raised or invested across asset classes in climate-themed investments alone. As extreme weather events make global headlines and experts warn about a shifting climate, more investors are thinking about both environmental risks and how they might affect their portfolios. They are also looking for investment decisions that may contribute to environmental protection or where the investment has tangible metrics and performance indicators. Early adopter investors are also no longer oblivious to the growth opportunities created by compelling climate innovations and changing consumer preferences. As Private Markets investors engage on this topic, we see increasing opportunities to effect meaningful change through true alignment of interest. Indeed, certain progressive thinking investment firms are implementing direct linkage between their fees and the outputs their investments have on the climate or environment, a unique and important step by managers showing both confidence in their investment acumen as well as moral compass. Whilst these observations do not represent the full extent of developments across what is a dynamically changing private markets investment landscape, they do represent some shifts that we believe could provide differentiated investment opportunities.

{"content": "Improving the Usefulness of Financial Statements The shift from tangible to intangible investments has complicated the ability to interpret financial statements. One solution is to record intangible investments on the balance sheet and then amortize them over their useful lives. We apply this approach to two companies in different industries and the S&amp;P 500 index. This results in a huge operating profit margin expansion for the company that is intangible intensive and an insignificant change for the one that is tangible intensive. We estimate that earnings for the S&amp;P 500 would be about 12 percent higher. This analysis suggests that one should compare earnings or valuation multiples over time with great caution. \u00d7 Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Counterpoint Global consists of 54 people, including 30 investors, four disruptive change researchers, two consilient researchers and two sustainability researchers.

{"content": "In the early hours of March 28, China started a two-phase lockdown of Shanghai\u2019s 26 million inhabitants1 in a desperate bid to control the spread of Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus, in what is turning out to be the latest in a series of missteps that have stalked the world\u2019s second-largest economy. China is currently facing its worst outbreak since the pandemic was first discovered in Wuhan in 2020. \u00d7 The containment effort, which also has enveloped Shenzhen, and several other regions, as part of China\u2019s \u201czero-Covid\u201d policy, is the latest in a confluence of events --from regulatory crackdown on big tech companies, to delisting concerns over U.S. ADRs and increased geopolitical risk -- that have created a perfect storm for the Chinese markets. Beijing\u2019s ambiguous stance on the war in Ukraine has alarmed investors just as Xi Jinping\u2019s policies promoting \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d (Display 1) and a barrage of regulations to rein in the tech industry have hurt their share prices. Government curbs on borrowing in the property sector also helped set off a spiral of falling home sales, surging corporate bond yields and eroded confidence among investors and home buyers. Allegations of Xinjiang human rights abuses have added to the complexity of investing in China for foreign investors, and in all likelihood this might be the toughest conundrum to resolve. \u00d7 Display 1 Fading Mentions of \u201cCommon Prosperity\u201d Story Counts on Common Prosperity -Jan 2020 \u2013 March 2022 \uf065 Source: Bloomberg, Jeffries. \u00d7 Display 1 Fading Mentions of \u201cCommon Prosperity\u201d Story Counts on Common Prosperity -Jan 2020 \u2013 March 2022 Source: Bloomberg, Jeffries. For investors, the Chinese markets were a roller-coaster ride. On the way up, stocks soared 87% from 2020 to record highs in early 2021, or almost doubling, before losing half their value in the following 12 months.2 The MSCI China Index is currently down 45%, recovering from a 55% plunge, from its early 2021 peaks.3 The regulatory crackdown on tech companies decimated their shares, as the listed market cap of Chinese Internet stocks collapsed almost 60% to $1.3 trillion, from a $3.04 trillion peak.4 The plummeting markets forced Beijing\u2019s hand. Vice Premier Liu He, Xi\u2019s top economic adviser, made a surprise policy change announcement on March 16 offering \u201cconcrete actions.\u201d Although vague on details, Liu downplayed the delisting of Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges and suggested plans related to ADRs and overseas listings were being worked out. He offered that the pace of regulation of Internet platforms should ease (Display 2) and the government would propose \u201cstrong and effective\u201d policies to defuse the real estate sector and to keep the capital markets running smoothly . Investors liked the \u201cBeijing put.\u201d The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index jumped 33%, in one day, the most ever.5 Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index surged 9.1%, the most since 2008 while China's CSI 300 Index climbed 4.3%.6 \u00d7 Display 2 China Could Be Past Peak RegulationBeijing Regulatory Actions \u2013 November 2020 -March 2022 \uf065 Source: Piper Sandler.

As of March 30, 2021 It is too early to say that China has witnessed its \u201cDraghi moment.\u201d A decade ago, the European Central Bank president Mario Draghi staved off financial calamity by promising to do \u201cwhatever it takes,\u201d to save the euro zone from a three-year sovereign debt crisis, in which several periphery countries including Greece, Ireland and Spain had their debt downgraded to junk status. Government intervention can cut both ways. In the past, China\u2019s handling of the economy was considered a success. This time, Beijing was forced to change course and appease international investors to head off further cratering of the economy. The government faced the risk of massive layoffs by Internet companies when employment numbers are already weak. The downward market spiral threatened to impact the real economy, necessitating a much larger stimulus later. Beijing also needed to send a signal regarding the debt-ridden property and construction sector, which could hurt the rest of the economy if not managed through orderly and controlled defaults. The final deciding factor may have been foreign investors pulling out of stocks and bonds in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. According to China Central Depository &amp; Clearing, a depository for government bonds, overseas investors\u2019 holdings of Chinese onshore bonds fell by 67 billion yuan (US$10.5 billion) in February, the largest monthly decline since 2017.7 China\u2019s economy is slowing, weighed down by depopulation, declining productivity, high debt and the hollowing out of manufacturing industries. The country\u2019s average income reached middle class phase in 2015, a point when all miracle economies have slowed.8 Mounting debts and a declining labor force have weighed on the economy which got a boost from last decade\u2019s tech revolution. Today, the digital economy generates 40% of GDP output.9 Going forward, growth will likely increasingly come from the next generation of the new, \u201chard tech\u201d driven economy. In the 2010s, China\u2019s economy grew thanks to consumer Internet service giants that offered shopping, entertainment, mobile banking and the like. We believe the next turn will be to science-based industries like semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech and high-end manufacturing. Xi is pushing for self-reliance in tech, and less dependency on the U.S. in order to localize supply chains. His drive to make China carbon neutral signals deeper investment in industries such as electronic vehicles and renewable energy. If the 2000s saw the last surge of the Old China, and the 2010s the rise of New China, the 2020s will be the decade of China 3.0\u2014an even more deeply digitizing economy. Any stimulus will mean increasing debt in the economy, a concern given the degree of leverage in the property sector. Beijing, at this point wants to manage the situation with \u201ctalk\u201d rather than large fiscal and monetary relief, which tended to prompt enormous enthusiasm from international investors. Therefore, expect more palliative rather than stimulative measures. While historically these may not address the core issues of slower economic growth and pressure on corporate earnings, in the current environment, it will help avoid a systemic risk induced by a sell-off in bonds and equities. In our opinion, the well-known \u201cNew China\u201d names that dominated the market in the last decade will continue to fade. What excites us are the next generation science-based industries that will create world-class companies which will attract talent and generate well-paid jobs and steady earnings growth. The wild card is the fallout from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. China must have been alarmed at how quickly the West unified to arm Ukraine, impose sanctions on Russia and isolate Vladimir Putin. The U.S. has publicly warned China that any attempt to help Russia evade the West\u2019s sanctions would result in it being targeted with the same sorts of measures that have plunged the Russian economy into chaos. Xi has called Putin his \u201cbest friend,\u201d and although bilateral trade last year surged 35% to $147 billion,10 it\u2019s hard to see Beijing taking any steps that could invite Western sanctions. The economic balance of power greatly favors China rather than Russia. China consumes 15% of Russia\u2019s exports and provides about a quarter of its imports.11 Moscow has a much smaller trade influence, accounting for only 2% of China\u2019s exports and supplying 3% of its imports.12 Today Beijing holds about $1 trillion in U.S. dollars, about 50% more than Russia\u2019s total foreign currency reserves.13 For now, Liu\u2019s intervention is a reminder that the government will not allow an economic downturn this year, especially ahead of the Communist Party congress that will reward Xi with an unprecedented third term. For his part, Xi would certainly prefer to arrive at the conference with an economy that is gathering steam and back on track. He faces a tough task trying to balance relations with Russia and the West, amidst a commodity price shock, a surging Omicron wave and an ongoing property fallout that will weigh on the markets. \u00d7 DOWNLOAD TALES FROM THE EMERGING WORLD .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:fit-content; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Stocks of small-capitalization companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets, and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more-established companies. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the Portfolio\u2019s performance. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Cryptocurrency (notably, Bitcoin) operates as a decentralized, peer-to-peer financial exchange and value storage that is used like money. It is not backed by any government. Federal, state or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency may experience very high volatility. 1. Reuters 2. MSIM, Bloomberg 3. MSIM, Bloomberg.

{"content": "Equities rallied in the final two weeks of March, with developed market equities recouping part of their YTD losses. The S&amp;P 500 (USD) ended the month up 3.7%1, the MSCI Europe (EUR) returning 1.0%1 and the MSCI Japan (JPY) up 5.0%1, whilst the MSCI Emerging Markets (USD) fell -2.2%1. Oil prices continued to crank higher due to the Russia-Ukraine war, with the benchmark WTI at one point reaching $123bbl2, before pulling back to $100bbl1 by month end, as China\u2019s lockdowns dampened demand. The VIX came down significantly from 36.53, finishing March at 20.61. Bonds sold off, with the US 10-year Treasury yield jumping to 2.3%1 by March end. \u00d7 Is the rally a short-term reversal? This year\u2019s sell-off appears to have been driven by sentiment, not an earnings recession. Commodity-exporting countries are showing the most value, though most equities no longer appear expensive,4 with the US the exception. Earnings are still expected to grow around 9% over the next 12 months5. However, the risk is markets take another leg lower and 2022 growth expectations get downgraded. Moreover, the major macro themes reinforce two outcomes: higher inflation and weaker growth. Both the war in Ukraine and China\u2019s renewed lockdowns put upside pressure on inflation and downward pressure on growth, as well as exacerbating supply chain disruptions, particularly for commodities from Russia. The Fed hikes and signals aggressive tightening to come Central bank policy is also being watched closely. As US inflation accelerated to a 40-year high of 7.9%6 in February, March\u2019s FOMC meeting brought the first rate hike since 2018. Chairman Powell signaled aggressive tightening, citing a potential 50bps hike in May. He indicated that the economy should be able to withstand the pace, as should the labour market which is \u201ctight to an unhealthy level7\u201d - another acknowledgement the Fed may be behind the curve. The Fed Funds futures are reflecting market and Fed alignment, with 7-8 rate hikes in 2022 and 4 in 2023. Investment Implications We maintain low equity exposure, reflecting our defensive positioning. In addition to the broad commodities for portfolios which permit, we have included further inflation hedges and initiated downside growth hedges, such as gold and have lengthened duration. US 10-Year breakeven We have added an overweight to US 10-Year breakevens, to hedge against protracted inflation in 2022 and de-anchoring of US inflation expectations. Despite already lofty valuations, the recent commodity price spike further contributes to high core inflation. We have added to US rather than European inflation, as we believe US inflation is more structural than in Europe, where only some of the main components have been impacted (food and energy). In contrast, the US is experiencing more broad-based inflation, with wage increases also reenforcing the dynamics. Energy We added to our energy overweight, which should continue to benefit from higher equilibrium energy prices. Gold For portfolios which permit, we initiated an overweight to gold, as a diversifier of geopolitical risks, particularly in the face of global growth fears. Sanctions on Russia have reinforced gold\u2019s role as the currency of last resort. Compared to other commodities, gold is still attractively valued. Duration We moved from underweight to neutral duration. Long-end yields will likely remain capped, as the growth outlook deteriorates, due to the commodity supply shock. Central banks, led by the Fed, should continue to hike into slowing growth to keep inflation in check, leaving front-end rates to trade with an upside bias. Eurozone equities, financials and UK equities We reduced exposure to eurozone equities, given stronger links to Russia, relative to the US and rising risk of recession in Europe. We reflected this through reducing European banks, expressed in some portfolios through a removal of global financials. We added an overweight to UK equities, to gain exposure to UK banks, as well as materials, energy and consumer staples. This is not only a defensive play, but also an inflation hedge due to high commodities exposure, relative to Europe. Chinese internet We removed our position in Chinese internet stocks, due to heightened global volatility from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the potential increase in US-China tensions and renewed lockdowns in China. Although attractive in the longer-term, near term they are likely to remain under pressure from negative sentiment.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser\u2019s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio\u2019s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio\u2019s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. \u00d7 Andrew Harmstone Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Manfred Hui Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Select Product(s) Right Click Edit", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/managing-portfolios-in-an-inflationary-world.html"}
{"content": "Nash Waterman, Head of Private Markets Secondaries at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, and Boris Secciani, journalist and Head of Research for the Italian publication Fondi&amp;Sicav, discuss the evolving landscape of GP-led secondaries, and why investors should take note. In this Q&amp;A session, the pair address the history of GP-led deals, and how a focus on high performing companies has made the strategy a compelling choice for investors. \u00d7 How has the secondary deal market in private equity evolved and based on what investment needs? \"This is certainly an interesting question and I am happy to provide my view of the secondary market. To answer, we need to start from a fact: the private equity secondaries industry was born and has evolved to address a myriad of different needs of equally diverse investors.1 The first transactions that fell into the macro-category of secondaries arose to meet two different needs. On the one hand, private equity funds are known to have a well-defined duration (i.e. it has a clear fund term), typically 10 years, with investors (so-called limited partners) having specific and often non-negotiable liquidity needs. On the other hand, managers of such a product (so-called general partners) sometimes need more time to be able to adequately realise the potential value of the assets held. For these reasons, the first secondary transactions took place in the context of so-called internal buy-outs in which existing general partners and new limited partners acquired an existing portfolio in a new vehicle.\u201d \u201cIn the early days of our secondaries program, Morgan Stanley Investment Management\u2019s private secondaries team focused on these deals as well. However, we began to pivot to GP Led deals in the early 2010s and in 2016, moved away from traditional secondaries for what we viewed as the most compelling part of the secondary market, single asset secondaries. Why do buyers find this opportunity attractive? \"In general, buyers (and many of their LPs) see the distinguishing benefits of secondaries private equity to include faster deployment in a potentially diversified set of investments, shorter duration, potential for attractive IRRs with less of a j-curve.1 I have always believed secondaries have an important benefit that is overlooked: GPs have generally owned these companies for some period of time. These managers have generally passed the higher risk discovery stage that occurs at the beginning of a PE investment. The existing GP and the management team know the company very well at this stage. This dynamic can be hugely beneficial for the secondaries buyers. Secondaries avoid the part of the lifecycle of a private equity investment that we believe is often the riskiest. While single asset secondaries opportunities were relatively scarce in 2016, we felt the opportunity was so compelling that we shifted our secondaries program to focus on this single asset strategy, with the goal of delivering our clients a market-leading and differentiated secondaries offering.\u201d In recent years, so-called single-asset secondaries have become very popular. Can you give a few more details about this? \"I love this question because it shows how much the sentiment has changed. As noted, in 2016, single asset secondaries were a little-known investment area and some may have questioned our strategy initially. In our view, single-asset secondaries address a fundamental natural conflict in private equity. What does a private equity manager do if they find a great business they believe has significant potential for value creation going forward but they have run out of time or resources to pursue that potential within their existing fund? Should the GP sell the asset and send back the cash to its investors? Should the GP hold onto the asset and potentially extend their fund life? Should the GP sell it to their most recent fund? Private equity investors do not see it all the same way. Some want cash. Some want to hold assets they believe have potential. Some are fine either way. Single asset secondaries provide choices for LPs, who generally can choose to sell or hold. For buyers, the case for single asset secondaries is relatively simple in my view. I believe GPs more commonly move forward with these transactions for their best companies, creating a positive selection bias from the seller. Furthermore, we can frequently conduct due diligence alongside the owner and the management team-who are STAYING with the business. This small nuance makes a material difference. Both parties are incentivized to be transparent with us because we are partners going forward. This approach has helped us achieve strong performance with the potential for returns beyond what many investors expect for a secondary fund.2 At Morgan Stanley Investment Management, our goal with our single asset secondary funds is to exceed not only typical secondary fund performance, but also the performance of the PE market in general. Our current Ashbridge II Fund seeks to deliver top quartile returns on an IRR basis, on a multiple of investment capital, and on a DPI basis. What kind of companies are you most interested in? \"In overall terms, the secondary sector is quite diversified, with groups that specialize in different industry segments requiring a different set of skills.1 In our case, we are interested in companies that provide an essential product or service to a stable end market. We live in an unpredictable economic environment. We can no longer invest with the comfortable predictability of what many call cycles. As a team, we generally do not consider cycles or cyclicality when choosing our investments. We invest with the assumption that there will be a continuous set of surprise economic shocks that will challenge certain industries, certain countries, and sometimes the global economy. For many of us, we view our careers as having been an ongoing set of economic crises with pauses in between. We seek to prepare for that reality and take advantage when investing\u201d. There are increasing concerns about the continuation of a higher inflation rate and thus, at least in the medium term, a higher cost of money. Do you fear such developments? Do you think that the private equity industry, which is often characterised by a high degree of leverage, will face difficult times? \"We believe a minimal amount of inflation is good for the economy and the markets. It is no coincidence that over the last decade the monetary authorities have gone to great lengths to try to stimulate it. In the long run, the effects of having interest rates at or below zero are probably more negative than positive in our view. That said, excessive leverage will be a problem for many companies in a rising rate environment and is a risk that we seek to minimise within our Ashbridge II Fund. 1 Diversification does not eliminate the risk of loss. 2 Past performance is not indicative of future results. \u00d7 Nash Waterman Head of AIP Private Markets Secondaries AIP Private Markets Team Reproduced with permission of: \uf065 BY BORIS SECCIANI \u00d7 Reproduced with permission of: BY BORIS SECCIANI", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/the-evolution-of-gp-led-secondaries.html"}
{"content": "With more than three decades of investing in emerging markets, our team has long recognized the importance of sustainable development and ESG challenges. When identifying and evaluating stocks, our portfolio managers place a great deal of emphasis on the quality of leadership, sustainable drivers of value and pathways for growth. We also believe that socialization of ESG factors in EM will mean an added set of disclosures and transparency over time, which will be critical not just to a fuller understanding of ESG risks and opportunities but to offer an additional lens on the quality of the businesses in which we invest. As active managers, we have always believed in the importance of direct dialogue with company management, and since 2017, we have added dedicated ESG engagements to our process. Material ESG issues are incorporated into our general management meetings, but we also believe that specific engagements allow us to look beyond an ESG data point and understand at a deeper level how a company\u2019s ESG risks and opportunities are evolving, and impacting corporate strategy, current operations and long-term financial performance. We are then able to evaluate qualitative and quantitative ESG factors in greater detail and integrate them into our investment decisions. Our portfolios consist of companies that we believe will remain proactive and resilient, and continue to generate sustainable earnings growth in the face of critical environmental and social challenges globally. Finally, as responsible managers, we actively examine and vote our proxies. Voting represents the direct participation of shareholders in the overall governance of a corporation and offers shareholders a voice on important issues, such as director independence and executive compensation. In 2021, we voted at 263 meetings and reviewed 2,823 proposals across our team\u2019s strategies. We voted against management 8% of the time, the majority of which were on board/directors\u2019 independence issues and executive compensation. Further, investor expectations for independence and diversity of board members and increased disclosures are growing. We believe both are part of a nascent effort to refresh stale boards in EM, an effort that can bring fresh perspectives, added expertise and more accountability. \u00d7 Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:60%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Emerging Markets Equity Team \u00d7 Featured Funds Active International Allocation Portfolio MSACX | Class I China Equity Portfolio MAKIX | Class I Emerging Markets Leaders Portfolio MELIX | Class I Emerging Markets Portfolio MGEMX | Class I Next Gen Emerging Markets Portfolio MFMIX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/emerging-markets-esg-and-sustainability-2022-report.html"}

{"content": "In January 2019, Ken Michlitsch, AIP Alternative Lending Group Portfolio Manager, interviewed Upstart CEO David Girouard about the increasingly important role machine learning plays in the consumer lending process. \u00d7 Background While machine learning has been embraced by diverse industries, from online shopping to autonomous cars, finance has been a relatively slow adopter. Commensurate with the rise of consumer alternative lending that has begun to change\u2014to the benefit of consumer borrowers. Consumer alternative lending encompasses online platforms that use a marketplace model to bring together consumer borrowers and lenders. These platforms view the consumer underwriting process through a different lens than traditional consumer lenders do. While traditional lenders commonly focus on a narrow set of borrower attributes, such as income and employment status, alongside a credit score (a backward-looking risk assessment metric), alternative lending platforms may use a much broader dataset to predict a borrower\u2019s ability and willingness to repay a loan. This alternative data might include educational background, occupation, housing costs, bank account transaction details and/ or estimated free cash flow. This fuller picture of the borrower in some circumstances can mean consumer access to credit not otherwise available at comparable rates. Indeed, on December 3, 2019, five federal financial regulatory agencies issued a joint statement on the \u201cbenefits that using alternative data may provide to consumers, such as expanding access to credit and enabling consumers to obtain additional products and more favorable pricing and terms.\u201d1 Underpinning this model is data: access to lots of data with the ability to analyze it quickly and competently. Machine learning facilitates real-time processing of huge volumes of data about loans with the goal of ever-improving, ever-\u201csmarter\u201d models that make sense of it all. In short, the rise of alternative lending has been driven by the same boom in data that we\u2019ve seen disrupt industry after industry. What prompted your decision to launch Upstart? The traditional lending model hasn\u2019t changed in many decades. Banks continue to use the same backward-looking metrics and models that they\u2019ve used for years, making credit available to the same types of borrowers at the same terms. That works well for some borrowers, but not all. We realized the types of technologies we were building at Google could make a positive impact on how credit is accessed by more types of borrowers. The tools we were working on could provide a more predictive model that could understand who an applicant is, his propensity to pay something back and his capacity to pay it back. In short, we saw the opportunity to dramatically improve access to credit for people. Far more people in this country are judged as \u201crisky\u201d than actually are. What type of borrower stands to benefit from the alternative lending model? Younger borrowers come to mind. We think of ideal candidates as \u201cfuture prime\u201d borrowers: they don't have blemished credit, but they don't have a lot of history either. They are transforming themselves from being net debtors, often because of student loans or medical bills, to being wealth creators. Machine learning helps us see the trajectory of their incomes. Can you compare and contrast alternative lending underwriting with traditional bank underwriting? Traditional models tend to be FICO-centric and rules-based. For example, a borrower must be above a certain FICO score and can't have had any bankruptcies within a certain number of years in order to qualify for a loan. The rate a bank assigns to a borrower who meets those criteria depends on the perceived credit-worthiness assigned by their model. A borrower who falls short on any of these measures is simply denied credit. Traditional lenders have come to use a larger number of variables, relying on linear regressions to inform their views on which variables matter most, but their models have remained fairly static over time. Alternative lenders analyze thousands of variables, including borrower bank account transactions, monthly repayments, prepayments, delinquencies, and their models look for patterns in the way those variables interact. Much more quickly than a human being ever could, machine learning enables models to \u201clearn\u201d from data as soon as it\u2019s introduced, becoming better and better able to make predictions about likelihood of defaults. In other words, over time models can predict that if ten specific things are true, an eleventh is likely also true. For example, knowing where someone went to school, what he studied, what his tax burden is, where he works, and what his monthly bank transactions are allows a model to extrapolate other things that increase a lender\u2019s confidence about that person\u2019s willingness and ability to repay a loan in the future. How does machine learning impact other parts of the alternative lending process? Machine learning has a role to play at every stage of the process: this includes customer acquisition, credit scoring, loan servicing and the mechanism through which loans are repaid. With customer acquisition, the challenge is identifying the right borrowers, people who need a loan and are likely to qualify for one. Lenders target potential borrowers digitally, but somewhat surprisingly also achieve good results through direct mail campaigns. Machine learning facilitates a degree of automation in the application process as well, reducing the amount of human oversight and time required to process a loan. For example, if an applicant provides access to his bank account, a lender can immediately verify his education, income and current employer without requiring documentation for each of those three things. This means less paperwork for the applicant to gather, fewer documents for the lender to review and quicker turnaround time for both parties. Over time, this can translate into lower costs being passed through to the consumer. Loan servicing can also be done in an automated way. Alternative lenders generally use an automated clearinghouse to pull payments directly from a borrower's bank account; no bill is sent and no paperwork is filled out on a monthly basis. Do you think there are broader applications for machine learning in the lending space? In a decade we believe that most types of lending around the world will rely on machine learning as opposed to traditional models because the difference in economics is so dramatic. We have fairly reliable data that shows for a given set of borrowers in certain FICO ranges our loss rates are less than half of what we see in our industry. That is an enormous difference, and it's not random. It's a fundamentally different system, one that is transferable to small business, real estate and auto lending. \u00d7 1 https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/federal-regulators-issue-joint-statement-use-alternative-data-credit-underwriting/ \u00d7 Dave was formerly President of Google Enterprise and built Google's billion-dollar cloud apps business worldwide, including product development, sales, marketing, and customer support.

{"content": "February was a challenging month for financial markets, with most assets reporting negative returns. Most of the month was dominated by stronger-than-expected inflation causing central banks to turn more hawkish, causing fixed income assets, government bonds in particular, to perform poorly. However, the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which most investors did not anticipate, caused risky assets\u2014equities, corporate credit, emerging market debt\u2014to sell off. European assets did worse than U.S., which makes sense given Western Europe\u2019s economic linkages to central and Eastern Europe. The rise in energy prices\u2014both oil and natural gas\u2014is of particular concern for the European economic outlook given it is effectively a tax on consumers. European bank debt and equity also suffered due to concerns about Eastern European exposure and the impact Western sanctions will have on the financial sector. While government bonds staged a dramatic rally in response to the invasion, they still delivered negative returns for the month. The U.S. dollar and Swiss franc rose, given their \u201csafe-haven\u201d status, as did commodity currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollar. The Russian ruble depreciated around 30% due to the impact of sanctions; other Russian assets also depreciated in value significantly, the extent to which is difficult to know for sure given illiquidity. Reduced liquidity in financial markets is exacerbating downward price pressures making it difficult to disentangle changes in fundamentals from temporary dislocations. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date \uf065 Note: USD-based performance.

Fixed Income Outlook Financial markets have gone from worrying about COVID-19 to worrying about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The main impact on economies, beyond the immediate region, will be through higher commodity prices, mainly energy (natural gas and oil), but also food (wheat) and metals. The main concerns for investors are: what impact will this have on economic growth, central bank policy and corporate profitability. At present our expectation is that the conflict may continue for several months, but we are hopeful that it will not escalate further or expand into a broader regional or global conflict. This means the economic impact will primarily be felt through higher commodity prices, with the market already pricing in the expected supply disruption. There is a risk that sanctions, which have cut Russia off from global financial markets, destabilize global financial conditions, but we are optimistic that central banks will be quick to respond to any signs of stress. Higher commodity prices will effectively act as a tax on household and businesses, reducing demand for other goods and services, and pushing up inflation. It will be relatively obvious for central banks to ignore commodities\u2019 impact on inflation (which should be transitory) but more difficult for them to decide how much to tighten policy given inflationary pressures from other sources are strong but the growth outlook is now a lot more uncertain. Given economies were rebounding strongly before the conflict started, we think they will still grow at a robust rate, meaning central banks will remain committed to normalizing monetary policy, just more cautiously than before. So, expect 25 basis points (bps) rate hikes rather than 50bps jumps, getting to the same point in the end but taking a few months longer. This means we still expect government bond yields to rise from current levels, and credit products to remain under pressure (even if underlying asset quality remains sound). Uncertainty about the length and intensity of the conflict remains the biggest issue. That said, the meaningful sell off in credit products in March, particularly in investment grade bonds is already pricing in a significant deterioration in economic conditions and in the case of euro denominated credit, almost recessionary economic conditions. Central banks have their work cut out for them but for now we expect central banks will follow through on their pre-invasion monetary tightening strategies. The impact on corporate profitability is likely to be varied. The Energy, Commodities and Defense sectors are likely to benefit (not that we see a lot of this being priced in at present, especially in emerging markets); Healthcare and Telecoms will be least affected, and for Utilities it will depend on their exact regulatory and commodity exposure. Both Industrials and Consumer sectors will be negatively affected, but at least they were experiencing strong demand going into the crisis. However, there is no denying that the impact will be negative, with European corporates more affected. Still, we think the growth backdrop is strong enough that default risk remains low given the extent corporates have repaired their balance sheets over the last two years. We therefore think corporate credit remains attractive and have a preference for high yield over investment grade. The conflict has also created opportunities in emerging markets, which have repriced cheaper due to liquidity and contagion reasons; many of them ought to be beneficiaries of higher commodity prices, but this is not reflected in the recent price action. The U.S. dollar and Swiss franc have benefitted as \u201csafe havens\u201d and are likely to remain strong during this uncertain tumultuous period. Longer term the U.S. dollar looks stretched and may explain why it has not risen even by more than it already has. Developed Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW The month began with more signs of persistent inflation and further hawkish shifts from central banks, leading to a broad increase in rates. That narrative was interrupted as the attention shifted to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which disrupted global markets across asset classes. The initial increase in rates reversed, as a flight to safety supported government bonds and markets anticipated that central banks may move slowly when removing accommodative policies. The U.S. dollar appreciated due to its \u201csafe-haven\u201d status. Inflation remains a key theme, with data continuing to surprise to the upside, and the outlook exacerbated by higher commodity prices due to the Ukraine conflict.1 OUTLOOK Developed economy central banks face a more difficult job, as they now need to balance increased downside economic risk against stronger than expected inflation. Most economies are mainly affected by Ukraine through higher commodity prices, which are effectively a tax on consumers and will reduce demand for other goods. There are also concerns about what sanctions will do to global financial liquidity conditions. We still expect central banks to normalise policy. However, the pace is likely to be more cautious than previously speculated. This should mean that government bond yields still rise through 2022, as the conflict is likely to delay the pace of normalisation for three to six months rather than stop it. We have limited conviction on the direction of currencies. Emerging Market Rate/ Foreign Currency MONTHLY REVIEW Emerging markets debt (EMD) experienced a large increase in volatility upon Russia\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine towards the end of the month. Broader global markets did experience a related increase in volatility, but really focused on Russian and Ukrainian assets as well as those in the immediately surrounding countries. Local Russian fixed income assets were down an estimated 70% in value. U.S. dollar-denominated corporate debt,2 local sovereign debt,3 and U.S. dollar- denominated sovereign debt were also down.4 OUTLOOK The outcome of this situation is quite fluid and path dependent, including the degree of broader geopolitical impact and contagion into global capital markets as large scale sanctions begin to take effect. Various macro implications include further global inflation as a result of supply side shocks and the West\u2019s tolerance level for autocratic regimes. Corporate Credit MONTHLY REVIEW Investment grade corporate credit spreads widened in February with general market volatility continuing amidst macro disruptors. Government bond yields rose globally. The Russian invasion of Ukraine was the major news event in February where the sentiment is fluid reflecting each new piece of information. Other news impacting markets included upside surprises to the global inflation data. Corporate news in the month was dominated by fourth quarter reporting.5 The high yield corporate market remained weak in February. Concern over elevated inflation readings and increasingly hawkish messaging from the U.S. Federal Reserve remained a consistent theme. The Russian invasion of Ukraine injected additional volatility into the market. Over the month, yields rose by 35 bps and spreads widened.6 Global convertibles continued the worst start to a year on record as investors weighed the impact of rising rates and of war in Ukraine. Issuance was low in down markets in February. Growth sectors lagged again while only Energy and Materials rallied.7 The senior floating-rate corporate loan market lost ground in February driven by market volatility. Despite the modestly negative performance, loans fared better relative to other capital markets, including equities and high-yield corporate bonds.8 OUTLOOK Looking forward with valuations significantly above the long run average for spreads and nearing the wides of the fourth quarter 2018, we see value opportunities but expect volatility given the near-term uncertainty of geo-politics and the limited liquidity available if flows increase. Securitized Products MONTHLY REVIEW Agency MBS underperformed again in February. Spreads are now wider than pre-pandemic levels as the market anticipates the end of quantitative easing and potentially the beginning of quantitative tightening, but agency MBS spreads could widen further from supply-demand pressure. U.S. non- agency RMBS spreads were also wider across most residential sectors in February, as nearly all risk assets cheapened given concerns about inflation, central bank policies and geo-political events. U.S. ABS spreads were also wider, but fundamental performance remains strong and issuance remained high through the month.9 OUTLOOK We believe the securitized market still offers a unique combination of low duration, attractive yields, and solid credit fundamentals. We remain constructive on securitized credit and cautious on agency MBS and interest rate risk. \u00d7 The views and opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Management team as of March 2022 and are subject to change based on market, economic and other conditions.

There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. \u00d7 Global Fixed Income Team Our fixed income investment capabilities are driven by eight specialized teams \u2013 Agency MBS, Emerging Markets, Floating-Rate Loans, High Yield, Investment Grade Credit, Municipals, Multi-Sector, and Securitized \u2013 which span the global fixed income capital markets.

{"content": "The military conflict in Ukraine means the world is witnessing a televised humanitarian crisis and grappling with forces and scenarios not contemplated in Europe since the Second World War. Our team\u2019s thoughts are with the victims and families of all those affected. While year-to-date the MSCI World is down 8% in U.S. dollars, it remains up more than 10% in the last 12 months. This fairly limited market drop has been down to a de-rating rather than any fall in market earnings expectations. \u00d7 Forward earnings estimates, perhaps optimistically, have actually risen 3% over the last two months. Historically, it has been the robustness of earnings in tough times, be they the Global Financial Crisis or COVID, that has provided our global portfolios\u2019 relatively low participation on the downside, not something that has applied so far in 2022 given that the market\u2019s earnings have held up so far this year. It is worth noting that the de-rating has been valuation driven, with the more expensive stocks falling more. Dividing the MSCI World into five quintiles by end 2021 multiples, the top quintile is off 15%, the second down 9%, while the other three have only fallen 1-4%. While we have been very focussed on valuation over the last few years, trimming the more expensive, growthier names as they have re-rated, on top of always avoiding the most expensive growth names, the portfolio\u2019s high quality means that they are mildly more expensive than the market, with about half the portfolios\u2019 weight in the second quintile. As such the market\u2019s de-rating has been a headwind, though it has had the benefit of making some names, both inside and outside the current portfolios, more attractively valued. The final point to make is around the sector moves. Consumer staples, a key sector for our global portfolios, has held up relatively well this year, but looking at the other outperforming sectors in 2022, our philosophy means that we are not invested in energy (the standout performer this year), materials or utilities, while we are significantly underweight financials, not least because we avoid banks. We remain focused on compounding over the long run, something the market struggles to do. What we look for in a stock is simple, but hard to find. First on the list is companies with dominant and sustainable intangible assets, for instance brands or networks. These intangible assets should drive pricing power, which we define as the ability to pass on input cost inflation to the end consumer. This is particularly important in today\u2019s inflationary environment. The signal you have pricing power is a history of a high and stable gross margin in the face of input cost shocks. We also demand the ability to steadily grow revenues organically, rather than a volatile cyclical top-line, with a substantial recurring element. Such recurring revenue can come from repeat purchase of a favoured shampoo or face cream, or from long-term relationships and contracts. The combination of pricing power (protecting margins) and recurring revenues (protecting sales) should lead to robust profits. Given the reliance on intangible rather than tangible assets, these profits should be generated at high returns on capital, and as such robust earnings should turn into robust cash flows. Sadly, compounding requires more than a strong and sustainable franchise that can be relied upon to grow steadily at high returns. It also requires the right management, who are not only going to continue to innovate and advertise to preserve and improve the intangible assets, but also allocate the remaining free cash flows well. Some companies are fine acquirors, but most are not and should therefore focus on returning the excess cash to shareholders. The final test is valuation. We are happy to own companies we believe are going to compound at fair value, relying on the compounding to deliver the returns, but paying too much for them risks the permanent destruction of capital. This process for selecting stocks has been consistent for a quarter of a century. Both this history and basic economics suggest that our global portfolios\u2019 earnings should be relatively resilient in a squeeze on the wider market\u2019s profitability, be it due to inflation, governments\u2019 reaction to inflation or a geopolitical crisis. The market still looks vulnerable, especially if the current geopolitical crisis worsens, with the MSCI World Index over 17 times forward earnings, a multiple never reached between 2003 and 2019, and this on earnings estimates up 57% from June 2020 and 23% above the pre-COVID peak. In a deeply uncertain world, we would argue that limiting your uncertainty by owning a portfolio of relatively predictable compounders makes sense, particularly when they are available at a modest free cash flow premium to the market. \u00d7 Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy\u2019s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 Bruno Paulson Managing Director International Equity Team Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/investing-in-a-deeply-uncertain-world.html"}

{"content": "Talking Points Geopolitics are often the cause of 10% pullbacks in the S&amp;P 500. 10% corrections morph into 15% corrections 50% of the time.1 We think this 10% correction is highly likely to bleed to a 15 - 20% correction at some point during Q2, and hence the S&amp;P 500 to low 4,000/high 3,000 level. A major geopolitical issue + bad inflation numbers = Shouldn\u2019t the market be down more than 13%? Regardless of the tragic outcome in Ukraine, we have an inflation problem in the US that should continue to weigh on equities, at least for now. We do not believe this correction will bleed past the -20% level. Declines of that magnitude historically are associated with recessions. A recession just two years after the previous one would be highly unusual. The three previous bear market (non-recessionary) corrections stopped short of -20%: 1998, 2011 and 2018. Every time, the market subsequently rallied to new all-time highs within 4 months.2 Investing into every 10% non-recessionary correction has produced an average return of +15% over the following 12 months, even though the market may have become uglier first.3 The Fed anticipates inflation will subside into the spring. We agree. However, until then, the markets are operating in a vacuum. We expect corporate fundamentals will remain stronger than what many bears predict, which was the catalyst for the rapid bull market recovery in the three previous periods cited above: 1998, 2011, 2018. We maintain our original 2022 Outlook call. We continue to believe 2022 will be an \u201cok\u201d year for stocks, consistent with the third year off a recession low. These tend to be characterized by strong earnings, offset by a less accommodative central bank policy. Applied Equity Advisors Positioning: If the Fed or geopolitics were going to kill the economy, the two and ten-year treasury yields would be dropping, and there would be far greater stress in the bond market. This is consistent with our view that the US economy has the power to withstand the inflation/external shocks. In a rising interest rate environment, value stocks should continue to outperform. We continue to emphasize financials despite the recent hit due to the geopolitical situation. We expect financials will be relative outperformers in a rising yield environment. We have recently trimmed back energy exposure and added to financials. Energy is under-owned but very extended. While richly-priced growth stocks have dramatically repriced, rising yields will continue to weigh on these stocks. In our experience, once bubbles pop, they don\u2019t end in \u201cV\u201d bottoms. Our portfolios have been underweight in Europe, which looks like the right call, as the risk of a recession in Europe is far greater than elsewhere. However, our global European luxury consumer stocks have been taken to the shed recently. We anticipate sticking with current positioning here, as we have not seen signs of fundamental deterioration in those companies. Asia ex-Japan continues to be our biggest non-US exposure and fertile ground for finding out-of-favor stocks that have compounded at very high levels over time. These stocks continue to struggle, given the strength of the US dollar and the current fragility of the global investor especially towards China. Traditionally, the US dollar peaks with the first Fed rate hike.4 1 Since the S&amp;P 500 was incepted in 1928 through March 14, 2022. Bloomberg.

{"content": "The GP-led secondary market has witnessed a brisk pace of growth in the past two decades with a flurry of transactions in recent years. In 2021, GP-led secondaries represented 51% of the $135 billion overall secondaries market, a record year in deal volume. 1 Forecasts suggest another banner year in 2022, with deal volume expected to rise as much as 20% year on year.2 In this Q&amp;A, Nash Waterman, Portfolio Manager and Head of Private Markets Secondaries, discusses the growing opportunity set for General Partner (GP) led deals, spelling out why we believe the sector and the single-asset segment, in particular, are attracting growing investor interest. \u00d7 Where did GP-led secondaries start? NASH WATERMAN (NW): Like the wider secondaries market, GP-led deals were designed to solve a problem. In the early 2000s, financial groups needed to spin out of banks and GP-led secondaries became an efficient way to lift out these assets and teams. From there, the market evolved quickly, as the suitability of GP-led deals for use in other situations quickly became apparent. Today, single-asset transactions are the fastest growing area of the secondaries segment. The deals are gaining favor, as they provide existing GP and Limited Partner (LP) investors the ability to double down on their best portfolio assets or for LPs to take liquidity, while opening up access to outside investors without the need for highly competitive bidding processes. At which point did you notice a divergence from the LP-led secondaries market? NW: In the early 2010s, GP-led secondaries experienced exponential growth driven by post-crisis fund restructurings. With the deals evolving into highly bespoke solutions, we became skilled in the more customized and surgical approach these type of transactions require. We began structuring deals to lift out the specific assets that we found to be the most compelling. Unlike traditional LP-led deals, or multi-asset GP-led deals for that matter, where secondaries investments involve exposure to multiple assets at the portfolio level, this new approach allowed us to mitigate unwanted broader portfolio risk. Fast-forward to today and the single-asset model now stands as a functionally distinct segment of the secondaries market. Early on, however, these deals were a novel concept and we had to convince GPs that single-asset deals could help to maximize value. To start, we oriented the conversation toward problem solving. For instance, we would ask, \u201cDo you need a solution that brings in fresh capital?\u201d or \u201cDo you need more time to compound value for a prize asset?\u201d Oftentimes, that potential value would be sacrificed due to a lack of funds or premature exit. Single-asset deals open the way to unlock that additional value, which is a key reason we coined the term \u201ctransformational secondaries\u201d back before a standard nomenclature existed for these transactions. Why are GP-led secondaries so attractive to investors? NW: In our view, the sector offers the best access to top-quality assets in the middle market. Consider, too, that within private equity the penetration of secondaries activity is relatively low. In practice, this has tilted purchasing power toward buyers as primary deal activity has outstripped secondaries demand, creating a growing universe of investable assets. As a result, managers such as ourselves can be highly selective and intentional about adding positions to the portfolio and managing risk. Put simply, we are able to cherry pick the best assets in an opportunity set of holdings that GPs view as the most attractive companies in their portfolios. Relative to other segments of the secondaries market, single-asset deals stand out for their return potential. According to recent research by PJT Partners, nearly two-thirds of secondaries investors (62%) are targeting net IRRs of 20% or more in the single-asset segment.3 In comparison, return thresholds for the multi-asset GP and LP-led segments are much lower, with only 40% and 16% of investors targeting returns as high as 20% or more, respectively. Based on the fundamental performance and embedded value that we see in our own strategy, we believe that these investors\u2019 expectations for single-asset deals are realistic and achievable for allocators deploying capital into the space today. How does an allocation typically fit into an investor\u2019s portfolio? NW: In our experience, investors typically see these deals fitting in a few different ways. First, they view single-asset secondaries as a definitive alpha source within private equity. They see the value of the prize assets being sold, which, when combined with their shorter duration and lower volatility characteristics, make for highly compelling investments. Second, to the extent that assets are sold out of portfolios into continuation funds, an allocation to a focused singleasset secondaries fund can capture value that an investor might otherwise have lost\u2014i.e. as an investment, they can help to fill a gap left in the portfolio. More generally, we would argue that the divergence that we\u2019ve highlighted between LP and GP-led deals should be reflected in investors\u2019 planning. That is to say that secondaries should not be thought of as a single bucket. The two segments exhibit different risk and return characteristics and the simple fact that the GP-led market is now larger than the traditional LP-led segment suggests that a dedicated allocation to the sector warrants consideration. These are complex investments. What skills are involved? NW: As with other differences discussed above, investment skillset is an area where LP and GP-led single-asset deals starkly diverge. The intricacies involved in sourcing, undertaking due diligence and executing on single-asset deals explain precisely why investors can earn a complexity premium in the space. Below, we explain the steps that the Morgan Stanley Investment Management Private Markets Secondaries Team has taken in each of these areas to gain an edge. SOURCING. We built a dedicated sourcing subgroup focused exclusively on deal origination. Our team members meet regularly with GPs to develop networks that will sustain a proprietary pipeline of the choicest opportunities. As incubation periods for a deals can last from three to 24 months, investing in these relationships has been critical to being a first port of call when GPs consider secondary sales. The numbers bear this fact out. In our first portfolio, roughly 70% of our deals were either exclusive or proprietary. In our second portfolio, all transactions have been either exclusive or proprietary. DUE DILIGENCE. Due diligence entails deep work in analyzing financial statements, understanding end markets and undertaking quality of earnings reports. We commission market studies and speak with customers, suppliers and industry experts to gain a real insight into the fundamentals of a given asset. As with sourcing, this requires a dedicated team, which we began building from the ground up in the advent of this market. DEAL EXECUTION. Single-asset deals involve an incredibly complex negotiation process that can take three to six months to conclude with a wide array of stakeholders. Success requires a specialized skillset to navigate potential conflicts, as transactions can include the GPs, rolling LP investors, selling LP investors as well as the new buyer group. We\u2019ve transacted on 50 deals in this space, an amount not easily matched by our peers.

{"content": "The frequent appearance of ESG in everyday conversation is a welcome development. However, it is very important to clarify what ESG is (and what it isn\u2019t) and employ this frequently used term in its proper context. \u00d7 ESG, which is shorthand for Environmental, Social and Governance factors, is having a moment. While the concept has been around for a while, references to \u201cESG investing, ESG funds, ESG strategies\u201d in the media and by data providers seem to have spiked in recent months. The term \u201cESG investing\u201d is often used as a stand-in for sustainability or impact investing. It is not uncommon to hear comments along the lines of \u201cinvesting in renewable energy is a key part of our ESG strategy\u201d. In short, people assume ESG investing requires the pursuit of positive impact or doing good\u2014for the planet or people in need. This is not the case. In our view, ESG is not about doing good, nor is it an investment strategy in itself. ESG is simply a framework that can and, we believe, should be applied to all investment diligence processes. ESG diligence aims to identify and mitigate economic, social and governance risks that could weaken or de-rail an investment. For example, a company with inadequate environmental controls may suffer damage to its revenues, profitability, reputation and valuation should an incident occur. Investors who do not follow a process that would enable them to identify this company\u2019s environmental shortcomings before they decide to commit their capital are likely to suffer alongside it. One does not have to be a \u201cdo-gooder\u201d to see how weak ESG can materially affect investment returns. When thinking about ESG, most people focus more on the \u201cE\u201d component, likely because the dangers are more tangible and potentially catastrophic. BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon oil spill is a prominent example. However, in our view, social and governance risks are equally important. Social risks occur when communities are harmed in a way that is not environment related. Wonga, a pay-day lender in the UK, saw its path to a $20bn valuation wiped out when it was accused of predatory lending practices. On the governance side, the financial press is rife with stories of managerial misconduct, from fraudulent accounting to inadequate board oversight. Theranos, for example, went from a much hyped start-up to a scandalous mess, largely in part to insufficient governance procedures. The good news is that most investment teams consider these risks when evaluating opportunities. However, they may not bucket them into discrete ESG categories or have a formal ESG investment policy or process in place. We believe that having a strong ESG umbrella to corral these risks under in a cohesive way is valuable. A robust ESG focus embedded in all stages of the investment process, from underwriting to execution and monitoring, is fast becoming the basic requirement for any serious investment organisation. In our view, simply using an \u201cESG overlay\u201d or \u201cESG lens\u201d, or \u201cgiving consideration to ESG factors\u201d, will not cut it in a sophisticated world where the asset owners and stakeholders are deeply conscious of the risks they want to avoid. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Responsible Investment Prism \uf065 \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Responsible Investment Prism How does this translate into action? An ESG policy is not credible if it remains just a policy. For it to be meaningful, we believe all of the investment staff need to be trained on it and such training should be refreshed on a periodic basis. We believe the tone of solid ESG processes is set at the top of organisations, and, as such, a senior member of the investment team should own the ESG process. The trained investment team should then proactively discuss ESG risks during the investment process and not address them as an afterthought. The ultimate test is whether an otherwise attractive investment is rejected because the ESG risk cannot be mitigated. It is also important to acknowledge that ESG is not a blunt instrument. We believe it is fine to vary the level of ESG intensity from deal to deal. An investment in chemical manufacturing will require greater consideration of environmental risks than one in the software sector. The sales practices of a business focused on the public sector may require a different level of scrutiny that those of a direct-to-consumer business. This is an evolving phenomenon and we think teams should be open to grappling with contradictions and grey areas and using a feedback loop to refine their thinking about ESG. It is also important to place ESG in its correct context along the continuum of responsible investing. ESG, as discussed, is about doing the right thing with the aim to safeguard against downside risk. It does not require a change in investment mandate such as divestment from certain sectors like extractive industries, nor does it require token efforts such as using low energy bulbs (a frequent example). ESG, in our opinion, is simply about making sure the risk of an investment failure is tightly controlled. While there may be some positive social or environmental impact from improving ESG standards, it is incidental to the investment strategy aims. Sustainable investing is about seeking to achieve long-term resilience of an investment. It can be either something inherent in any long-term investor\u2019s process or it can be an explicit strategy. This could include looking at the environmental sustainability of the production process or the viability of the supply chain. It could also mean being aligned with market trends and consumer preferences. Examples include building back up data centres in areas less prone to flooding, switching from fossil-fuel based inputs to plant-based inputs and changing stock-keeping units to cater to the growing preference for organic products. It could also be about analysing an insurance company\u2019s liabilities arising from coastal properties or a services company adapting robotics to deal with labour shortages as the population ages. A lot of sustainability strategies will generate clear positive impact but it is not the objective of the investment strategy. Impact investing, on the other hand, is very much a distinct strategy which seeks explicitly to do good\u2014reduce CO2 emissions, save water, improve access of education and housing to deprived communities\u2014while making sure the investment also seeks to generate compelling returns. Impact may have elements of good ESG and sustainable practices, but it is not always certain. An impact investing team, like any other investing team, needs to incorporate proper diligence procedures to seek to ensure that ESG risks are squared away. Investing in a solar farm or an affordable housing project does not automatically allay pollution risk or weak governance. In our opinion, embedding ESG in the investment process is crucial for any investment strategy no matter where they are focused on the investment spectrum. There is no such thing as ESG investing, but there is such a thing as employing an ESG framework to evaluate the merits and risks of an investment. We believe that, over time, as more and more teams put this structure in place, this will be known simply as \u201cinvesting.\u201d Nothing more, nothing less. \u00d7 Vikram Raju Head of Climate Investing | Private Markets AIP Private Markets Team a.banner-btn { -webkit-border-radius: 25px; -moz-border-radius: 25px;border-radius: 25px; text-decoration: none; border: 2px solid #fff; padding: 10px 20px; font-size: 1.4rem; background-color: #ffffff; color: #337ab7;margin-top: 0px;display: inline-table;font-family: karlabold; } 2tileBento2 INSIGHTS SustainableSignals Survey 7 key findings emerged when we asked asset owners about their views on sustainable investing.

{"content": "Is now the time to own reasonably priced quality companies with pricing power, many of which are in EAFE? Bruno Paulson explains why the International Equity Team believes so. \u00d7 Even after the mild falls in January 2022, we still see markets as stretched, with the MSCI World Index on 18x forward earnings1, a multiple never seen between 2003 and 2019, on forward earnings up a massive 52% on the trough in June 2020. There are only two ways of losing money in equities - if the earnings go away or the multiple goes away, but unfortunately we would argue it is now time to worry about both of them happening, given peaky multiples on peaky earnings. On a more positive note, we would also argue that there may be two relative havens, which have struggled in relative terms over recent times, namely EAFE and reasonably priced quality and the Portfolio offers exposure to both. After a long and sustained period of relative underperformance, the MSCI EAFE Index marginally outperformed its U.S. equivalent in January, down only 4.8% in U.S. dollars (USD), versus -5.7% for the U.S. We are not suggesting that the tide has turned based on 90 basis points of outperformance in a month, but there are good reasons to be relatively optimistic on EAFE versus the U.S. The U.S. market is expensive, as reflected in Robert Shiller\u2019s CAPE \u2013 the \u2018cyclically adjusted price earnings\u2019 ratio, based on average inflation-adjusted earnings from the previous 10 years. The current approximately 38x level of the CAPE implies negative real returns over the next decade. This is a notoriously poor predictor of short-term returns, as shown in 2021, but it does suggest that the S&amp;P Index is not likely to be a lucrative safe haven over the next decade. It also looks pricey on the more conventional forward earnings multiple, at 20.4x, while EAFE sits at a 30% discount at a mere 14.3x. This discount to the U.S. oscillated around 10% until 2015; since then there has been a steady relative de-rating for EAFE. Part of the U.S. premium is down to mix, and the tech mega-caps which have grown their share of the global profit pie. But in addition, the U.S. economy outgrew Europe across the 2010s, with annualised gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the decade of 2.3% versus the euro area\u2019s 1.4% . This growth differential may not hold over the next couple of years, with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates2 suggesting the euro area may have higher GDP growth in 2022 (4.3% versus 3.7%) and again marginally in 2023 (2.5% versus 2.4%). The U.S. emerged faster from the pandemic, giving Europe the chance to catch-up, and is also facing higher inflation and tighter labour markets, meaning more tightening is likely to be required, with the associated risks of economic damage. The OECD estimates Q1 2022 inflation of 6.4% for the U.S., twice the 3.2% of the euro area. The cost pressures on corporates also seem tougher in the U.S., where unit labour costs were up 3.2% in the first nine months of 2021, while they stayed flat in the euro area. If it does prove to be the case that Europe can combine faster growth with less inflation and cost pressure, that may well drive a relative re-rating. Time for Reasonably Priced Quality? 2020 saw a growth bubble in expensive and loss-making technology companies, which was followed by a value rally as the massive government interventions and the vaccines miracle drove a far stronger economic outlook. Reasonably priced quality therefore got left behind. One proxy for this is the Consumer Staples sector, by far the biggest overweight for the portfolio, which lagged the overall EAFE market in both 2020 (up 6% as against 8% for the index) and 2021 (up 7% vs 11%). The sector has also had to deal with the sharp rise in commodity costs, which has put pressure on margins, given the lag until companies are able to raise prices for customers. Arguably, Consumer Staples companies have already faced much of the inflation pressure, which may now spread to other sectors during 2022. We also believe that the sector still has pricing power, and will therefore be able to preserve or restore its margins by passing on the cost rises to customers. Within the Consumer Staples sector, our holdings have been skewed towards cheaper plays, and those exposed to re-opening, as shown by the 16% discount they traded at relative to the Staples index at the start of 2020. This did not work in 2021, as the growthier names continued to re-rate and COVID waves continued. Indeed, the discount widened to 24% during the year, though the earnings growth of our names matched those of the sector. On a positive note, this left our holdings attractively priced at the start of this year, as well as positioned to benefit from the \u2018post COVID\u2019 re-opening, whenever it happens. Looking at the Portfolio more broadly, it is far higher quality than the EAFE Index, with a 24% return on operating capital and a 40% gross margin, which are both 50% higher than the index, along with a net debt/EBITDA ratio at 1.6x, which is 15% lower than the index. Less quantifiably, we believe it has stronger pricing power than the index, given this is a focus of our investment process, which could prove a useful asset as inflation bites. Despite this big difference in quality, it is only trading at an 11% earnings premium to the EAFE Index, and on a free cash flow basis this premium drops to a mere 4%. In a world of elevated multiples on what may be unsustainable levels of earnings, the focus should be on preservation of wealth, rather than chasing another year of outsized gains. In this environment, the EAFE market looks relatively attractively priced, particularly if Europe can match or exceed U.S. growth over the next couple of years. Within EAFE, we would also make the case for a portfolio skewed towards the higher quality, defensive sectors and built on companies with superior pricing power. It is time to keep the lights on, rather than trying to shoot them out. 1 Factset 2 OECD \u00d7 Bruno Paulson Managing Director International Equity Team Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/time-for-eafe.html"}
{"content": "The current geopolitical events on top of the ever present COVID-19 virus pandemic might make it seem like the world has been turned upside down. Yet, as disturbing as these events are, they are really just accelerating trends that were already well under way. Rising debt, global food and energy price hikes, territorial conflicts, increasing climate change and continuing technological barriers have only become even more pronounced with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In this paper, we convey our ten themes for the year examining the deeper trends that will likely have major economic, political and market impact. \u00d7 1. DEBT PROLIFERATION Inching higher for four decades, global debt soared during the pandemic, driven by government borrowing. Twenty five countries, including the U.S. and China, have total debt above 300 percent of GDP, up from none in the mid-1990s.1 Money printed by central banks designed to protect lives, preserve jobs and prevent bankruptcies also inflated the financial markets, which were about the same size as the global economy in 1980, and are now more than four times larger.2 This has only deepened the debt trap: societies addicted to debt find it tough to cut back, for fear of triggering a wave of bankruptcies and market contagion. Central bank mandates are generally designed to stabilize inflation and employment, but now also require that tremors in the financial economy do not negatively impact the real economy. Faced with such a dilemma, central banks need to avoid tightening too fast\u2014a delicate balancing act that, if mishandled, could generate additional volatility and even greater stress in financial markets. 2. BUT NO DEBT IMPLOSION U.S. government debt is at the highest level ever, at 133% of GDP, although it reached a similar levels of 121% in 1946 after World War II (Display 1).3 \u00d7 Display 1 Debt Spikes Coincide with Negative Real Rates \uf065 Source: MSIM Emerging Markets Research, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver. As of Feb 22, 2022 \u00d7 Display 1 Debt Spikes Coincide with Negative Real Rates Source: MSIM Emerging Markets Research, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver. As of Feb 22, 2022 And yet, the debt service burden is not as large as it was historically. Over the past decade, average global interest rates were lower than average global nominal GDP growth rates.4 This has made debt sustainable across countries, a marked difference compared to the conditions before and amid the great financial crisis. The downside, however, is that higher rates will likely have a much greater impact on government and non-government balance sheets, and risk being much more damaging today than they were just over a decade ago. This could force policy makers to remain behind the curve. Government debt sustainability depends on economic growth, budget balances and the interest cost of servicing debt. The key to debt servicing cost is the real interest rate. And with higher inflation ahead, even if nominal yields rise, real yields are likely to stay negative or low. That makes it unlikely we will witness a debt implosion, which would be the worst-case scenario for financial markets. 3. INFLATION GENIE OUT OF THE BOTTLE For a long time, inflation had been tamed. Last decade, inflation in the U.S. averaged only 1.8%.5 But as the rush of government Covid relief spending and debt last year, as well as the rise in oil prices driven by the Russian invasion of Ukraine push inflation higher, many in the media fear a return to 1970s levels of double-digit inflation when it rose to 11% in 1974 and more than 13% in 1980 (Display 2).6 \u00d7 Display 2 U.S. Inflation Highest Since the 1980s \uf065 Source: MSIM Emerging Markets Research, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver. As of Feb 22, 2022 \u00d7 Display 2 U.S. Inflation Highest Since the 1980s Source: MSIM Emerging Markets Research, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver. As of Feb 22, 2022 The economy of the 1970s not only suffered from two oil price shocks (Arab oil embargo in 1973 and the 1979 Iranian Revolution), but the closing of the gold window and subsequent floating of the dollar, the unwinding of wage controls that had suppressed wage inflation earlier in the decade, and widespread unionization that led to higher wage demands. Since then, the U.S. economy has become progressively less energy intensive reducing the impact of an energy price shock compared to the 1970s. The decline in union membership over the recent decades also puts a dampener on intense wage pressures. But it isn\u2019t the 2010s anymore either. The U.S. does have an inflation problem, which is likely to persist. Demographic decline means fewer workers and higher wages. Deglobalization--weakening flows of goods, money and people--reduces competition. Weak productivity growth implies higher costs. Efforts to reduce carbon emissions, is inflationary, as we note below. Sustained supply disruptions due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine will also put pressure on prices. The bigger risk however comes from asset prices. Even when the financial markets were much smaller than they are today, their corrections could depress consumers and lead to consumer price deflation, as Japan experienced in the 1990s. 4. GREENFLATION PARADOX Climate change is raising demand for the so-called \u201cgreen\u201d metals like copper and aluminum, but green politics has been reducing raw material supplies of all kinds. Investment in mines and oil fields has dropped by more than 50% in the last five to ten years (Display 3).7 Normally new technologies fuel a last gasp of defensive investment in old ones like electricity growth spurred a gas lighting boom in the early 1900s that continued for many years. \u00d7 Display 3 Global oil and mining capital expenditure has dropped significantly \uf065 Source: Bernstein, Wood Mackenzie, The Economist, MSIM Emerging Markets Research. As of 2020 \u00d7 Display 3 Global oil and mining capital expenditure has dropped significantly Source: Bernstein, Wood Mackenzie, The Economist, MSIM Emerging Markets Research. As of 2020 Green building projects will raise demand for \u201cdirty metals\u201d and fossil fuel. Green politics will cut supply, inflating the cost of building a cleaner economy. The harder policymakers try to bring forward the shift away from fossil fuels, the less oil and gas exploration will take place, and oil price will need to be higher until the transition is well advanced, and that can take many years. The curbs on Russian energy exports have seen rising oil prices and increased calls to expand domestic production. Governments are more focused on alleviating near-term price shocks but the long term trend is to cut reliance on fossil fuels. Both the demand and supply side dynamics in several commodities are supportive of a multi year boom in commodity prices. 5. AN EMERGING MARKETS COMEBACK Every decade one investment theme captures the attention of investors. The 2010s was dominated by large tech companies in the U.S. as the U.S. emerged from the Global Financial Crisis with a deleveraged economy, a cheap dollar and very attractive overall asset valuations. Emerging markets (EM) have fallen off the radar after the worst decade for emerging stock market returns since the 1930s8 \u2014and to makes matters worse, EM equities had another disappointing year in 2021. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index declined -2.3%, underperforming the MSCI World Index by 25%, due to a number of factors including: an economic slowdown driven by policy tightening, a regulatory crackdown in China, inflation overhang, dollar strength, EM currency weakness and COVID-19 shocks.9 Several critical catalysts, however, should turn the macro environment positive for the EM asset class this decade. We expect a comeback for select EM equities over the next few years driven by a post-pandemic recovery, pandemic-inspired reform, manufacturing, ongoing strength in commodities and the digital revolution. Asset class valuations are at very attractive levels, with equities at nearly a 50% discount based on composite metrics.10 6. CHINA 3.0 China\u2019s old economy is slowing, weighed down by depopulation, declining productivity, high debt and the hollowing out of manufacturing industries. Going forward, growth will come increasingly from the next generation of the new, \u201chard tech\u201d driven economy. In the 2010s, China\u2019s new economy was rising on consumer internet service giants that offered shopping, entertainment, mobile banking and the like. We believe the next turn will be to science based industries like semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech and high-end manufacturing. Xi is pushing for self-reliance in tech, meaning in particular less reliance on the U.S. in order to localize supply chains. His drive to make China carbon neutral signals deeper investment in sectors such as electronic vehicles and renewable energy. If the 2000s saw the last surge of the Old China, and the 2010s the rise of New China, the 2020s will be the decade of China 3.0\u2014an even more deeply digitizing economy. 7. A SILICON CURTAIN DESCENDS For the past decade, nations have erected barriers to slow the flow of people, trade and even money. Data has been the one exception. According to Ericsson, mobile data traffic in the third quarter of 2021 alone exceeded all the mobile traffic before 2017.11 In the U.S. and Europe, it is the regulators who are trying to rein in the tech giants and even the playing fields. Other countries are filtering data, and blocking it from crossing borders, creating the \u201cSilicon Curtain.\u201d Data localization requirements now act as non-tariff barriers to digital services trade and could reduce the efficiency of digital data trade. Techno-nationalism is on the rise where countries are viewing private-sector technological developments through the lens of national security. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is likely to accelerate the fragmentation of the global economy\u2014to include financial systems, beyond the traded goods system. 8. STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS We could witness a renewed capital expenditure cycle in several parts of the world to deal with global warming and geopolitical challenges. The realization that a net zero world path is not easy will lead to investments to meet the goals of energy security and expanding alternative supplies. For economic resilience, countries will focus on onshoring some productive capacity; insulating supply chains from geopolitical risk; and building inventories of important commodities and goods. The world of Just-in-time Management may be structurally changing. There is a need to increase defense spending especially in Europe and substitution of capital for labor could become necessary as faster wage growth will encourage higher labor-replacing investment. After 75 years of austerity in Germany, the tide may be turning. The pandemic saw Germany accept aggressive fiscal stimulus and debt mutualization within the EU. Recent EU bonds are a step in the direction to support these investments. 9. RETURN OF THE MATERIAL WORLD In the 2000s the world was overinvested in commodities and underinvested in technology. In the 2010s decade that trend reversed.12 Now a turn towards the commodities is underway. Despite the hype for the intangible economy, the rise in prices in the physical economy\u2014land, cars, raw materials and human labor\u2014tells a different story. A housing deficit has seen home prices rise 14% last year in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the highest since 1980 (Display 4).13 \u00d7 Display 4 Home Prices at Their Highest Year-over-Year Increase Since 1980 \uf065 Source: MSIM, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver. As of Q3 2021. \u00d7 Display 4 Home Prices at Their Highest Year-over-Year Increase Since 1980 Source: MSIM, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver. As of Q3 2021. Growing demand from millennials helped drive the global boom in both house and car prices in 2021. The cars of the future may be smarter than the current gasoline-burning models, but they also require a lot more copper and aluminum -- an electric car requires more than three times as much copper -- to connect their batteries and software. Physical labor shortages are translating into increased wages worldwide. Even the advances in the metaverse have fostered a land-grab as data centers become the new real estate. Behind every digital screen is an array of microchips and costs that have soared amid a global shortage, demonstrating how even the most digital tech sectors are not immune from physical world constraints. 10. ELECTIONS, GEOPOLITICS AND MARKET RISK U.S. midterm elections and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine will likely weigh on global stock markets. The average drawdown in U.S. markets is historically much greater in a mid-term election year compared to any other.14 The silver lining is that more often than not, markets have bounced back strongly in the year following those elections.15 Russia has swiftly achieved pariah status and we believe will remain uninvestable for some time unless there is a regime change, a prospect that will add further uncertainty and global market turmoil. Our work on 27 geopolitical conflicts since 1939 shows markets have had a probability of being up 70% of the time a year out after the conflict.16 Disruptive geopolitical events are abruptly discounted by global markets in the short term, while the underlying economic context tends to prevail over the medium to longer term. The commodity price shock as a result of the current geopolitical situation has been significant and, if sustained, could present an altogether different challenge for the global economy, with the potential to affect the monetary policy cycle, growth and earnings cycles. Panic selling by retail investors who opened trading accounts for the first time during the pandemic could add further pressure. From the United States to Europe, millions of people opened trading accounts for the first time in 2021 and in the U.S., net purchases of stock topped $1 trillion for the first time,17 a trend that has continued so far this year. IN SUMMARY Economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has been derailed by geopolitical concerns. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has further advanced trends that were already in play. Food and energy price hikes will add to inflationary pressures as an indebted global economy prepares to tackle climate change and health concerns. Fears of continued conflict in Europe and beyond will increase calls for technology and broader protectionism, bringing a greater appreciation for the physical world. These trends will continue to shape economic, political and market dynamics in 2022\u2014and beyond. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Stocks of small-capitalization companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets, and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more-established companies. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the Portfolio\u2019s performance. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Cryptocurrency (notably, Bitcoin) operates as a decentralized, peer-to-peer financial exchange and value storage that is used like money. It is not backed by any government. Federal, state or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency may experience very high volatility. ESG Strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. 1 IIF, Haver 2 MSIM, BIS, IMF, McKinsey 3 Deutsche Bank 4 McKinsey, CEIC, OECD, World Bank 5 MSIM, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver 6 MSIM, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver 7 Bernstein, Wood Mackenzie, The Economist, MSIM Emerging Markets Team Research.

{"content": "February was marked by the escalating tensions and a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. Many asset classes were already on a downward trend since the beginning of 2022, given inflation pressures, concerns over rate hikes and deterioration in investor sentiment. However, as the situation between Russia and Ukraine rapidly worsened over February, asset classes that had already sold off, such as the major developed equity regions, sold off further, with the S&amp;P 500 moving deeper into correction territory, while the Nasdaq moved closer to a bear market. \u00d7 The S&amp;P 500 (USD), MSCI Europe Index (EUR) and MSCI Emerging Market Index (USD) declined around 3.0% over the month, with the MSCI Japan (JPY) faring slightly better, down 1.1%1. Unsurprisingly, Russia was hardest hit, with the MOEX Russia Index (RUB) plummeting 30.0%1. At the same time, the price of crude oil rose to levels not seen since 2014, due to heightened concerns over disruptions to global energy supplies. The VIX2 ended the month at 303, as the conflict intensified, and international sanctions tightened around Russia. Implications on inflation and monetary policy In our team\u2019s recent market outlooks, we have highlighted our view that inflation is not transitory, but is likely to persist, at least through the first half of 2022. A prolonged conflict would keep upward pressure on energy prices, and in turn contribute to upward pressure on inflation. However, there is likely to be a notable difference between Europe and the US in this respect, given that Europe is highly reliant on imports of Russian gas, but currently has low inventories. Our view of the impact of this crisis on inflation \u2013 and any implications for our portfolio positioning - is therefore one area of active discussion within the GBaR team. The impact of the crisis on global growth and on monetary policy are other areas of focus. Investment Implications We entered 2022 already cautiously positioned. At the time, we were talking of Russia/Ukraine tensions as a potential near-term risk and we were therefore monitoring the situation closely, but they were by no means the only risk. For example, during January, increasing evidence of US Fed hawkishness, inflation becoming embedded, concerns over decelerating growth, and deteriorating investor sentiment, were equally important in driving our forward-looking volatility expectations. This was in an environment in which certain areas of the equity market, such as US equity stocks and large tech names, still appeared overvalued. Our view is that the military conflict in the Ukraine is unlikely to end quickly; the situation is likely to worsen, before it improves. We therefore expect volatility to persist in the short term, so remain cautious in our positioning, in fact we felt it prudent to further reduce exposure to risk assets. Considering the above, we reduced equities further in February, from a level that already reflected caution. We believe that in the near term, this should position us well to weather the near-term market volatility. In addition, we remain underweight duration, given rising yields. We also made the following tactical changes: Broad Global Commodities At the beginning of February, we added an overweight exposure to broad global commodities, as an explicit hedge against an escalation in Russia-Ukraine tensions. Given ongoing signs of supply constraints within the commodity complex, we believe the downside risks to this trade are limited. We increased this position towards the end of February given our concerns at the speed with which the situation was deteriorating, and the increased likelihood of a full-scale invasion, such as we now have seen. European Banks At the beginning of the month, we reduced exposure to US Financials, in favour of their European counterparts. At the time our view was that European banks may benefit more from rising net interest income on higher rates, and may deliver higher capital returns, than their US counterparts. Since then, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has changed the dynamics, requiring a review of the position towards the end of the month. UK Equities We moved overweight UK equities, expressed through the FTSE 100, providing a blend of value and defensiveness through exposure to energy, materials, and consumer staples companies. We believe that an attractive valuation discount and lower (real) rate sensitivity, adds to the defensive character of the FTSE 100 in the current environment. Active US Growth For portfolios which allow active funds, we trimmed the US growth active managers, in favour of broader S&amp;P 500 exposure, to achieve a small underweight in large and mega-cap growth stocks. With slowing growth, near-term inflation pressures, and rising nominal and real rates, we expect to see continued pressure on US mega-cap names, which still trade at substantial 12-month forward PE premiums to the broader market.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser\u2019s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio\u2019s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio\u2019s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. \u00d7 Andrew Harmstone Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Manfred Hui Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Select Product(s) Right Click Edit", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/russia-ukraine-risk-and-investment-implications.html"}

{"content": "Russian President Putin\u2019s decision to launch a full invasion of Ukraine has, in a matter of days, taken the Russian economy from a globally integrated economy of scale and potential into one isolated and on a trajectory toward pariah status. Russia is being hit with unprecedented sanctions by the EU, UK and US and others, meant to be punitive in nature and only increasing in breadth and depth over the past few days. Russia announced its own retaliatory sanctions and domestic policy responses on February 28th. \u00d7 The initial sanctions enacted by the G7 and EU countries last week were significant but manageable; however, the ones built up over the weekend are now essentially unprecedented for an economy the size of Russia. Their main goal is to target the financial system punitively for Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine\u2014the ability of Russia to access the international capital markets, international payments systems (SWIFT), and even its long accumulated foreign reserves (Breakdown of Russian International Reserves - Pre Sanctions on Central Bank \u2013 Display 1). Display 1 Breakdown of Russian International Reserves - Pre Sanctions on Central Bank Billions USD Source: MSIM, Haver, Bank of Russia, ING, Reuters. Data as of June 2021 In the years since Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia has been conducting fiscal and monetary policies seeking to insulate its economy from external vulnerabilities. In response to these latest sanctions, Russia itself has announced its own counter measures on the morning of February 28th, including freezing foreign stock holdings, hiking interest rates to 20%, banning citizens from moving capital abroad, and forcing the conversion of foreign exchange revenues from exports in rubles\u2014in other words, Russia has imposed capital controls.1 The announcements are continuing but many lines have already been crossed, disrupting economic norms and practices that have been in place for decades. Once implemented, history and this specific situation strongly suggest that comprehensive sanctions and capital controls are likely to remain. Beyond the direct impact, these will have a chilling effect on businesses, foreign investment and perception of Russia for years to come. As long as Putin remains in power, the direction of the Russian economy appears headed toward isolation and autarky. From a global perspective, the Russian invasion of Ukraine could affect the global economy via three channels\u2014economic growth, trade and monetary policy. The hit to economic output likely will be minimal as both countries combined account for only 2% of global GDP and trade.2 Exports to Russia and Ukraine combined account for well under 1% of GDP for each major economy such as the US, the Euro Area, China or Japan.3 Spillover caused via the commodity markets, however, could be much more material as Russia\u2019s share in global commodity production is large for major energy sources such as oil (11%) and gas (17%), and also for precious metals (11%), industrial metals (9%), as well as wheat (11%), and fertilizers (8%).4 Ukraine\u2019s share in global exports is large for wheat (7%) and corn (22%).5 There is also a risk to disruption in Russian PGM (platinum group metals) supply, with the country accounting for 12% of global platinum mine supply and 37% of global palladium supply, both of which are critical in the production of automobile catalytic converters (Display 2).6 Analytically, commodities generally find their way to market. From a historic perspective, oil and gas exports from Russia continued to flow throughout the Cold War. Europe relies heavily on Russia for gas imports, and gas accounts for a relatively large spending share in European countries such as Germany. Although the EU has reduced its reliance on Russian gas, Russia still provides about 40% of EU gas supply.7 Lastly the impact on global inflation and monetary policy could lead to inflation being stickier than expected and market expectations of peaking inflation in March/April could be pushed out further.

History suggests that such disruptive geopolitical events are discounted by global markets in the short term, while the underlying economic context tends to prevail over the medium to longer term. Our work suggests that over 13 major geopolitical conflicts/attacks since MSCI EM inception in 1988, the 12-month forward return for MSCI EM in USD terms is generally positive (+18.5% on average, +3.5% on median basis) with a 70% probability of being positive over the full 12-month period after onset of the event (Display 3).8 Display 3 MSCI Emerging Markets: Geopolitical Event Study Key Date Current = February 22, 2022; Conflict Key Date -6months/+12months Source: Bloomberg, Factset, Haver.

Similarly, in a broader study of 27 geopolitical conflicts/attacks since 1939, the 12-month forward return for the S&amp;P 500 is generally positive (+6.8% on average, +10.1% on median basis) with a 70% probability of being positive after onset of the event.9 Russia\u2019s attack has swiftly left it isolated on the global stage and is the biggest shock to the country since the fall of Soviet Union. Russia will most likely remain uninvestable for global investors unless there is a change in regime While overall global economic impact could be muted in the medium term, the commodity price transmission due to potential supply issues of inflated prices of certain metals and energy support our allocation to select companies in these sectors. Equity markets may remain volatile while the conflict continues in the short term due to higher risk premium, history strongly suggests equities are driven by economic fundamentals longer term, which remains supportive for several countries and themes we have identified in EM. \u00d7 Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:fit-content; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Jitania Kandhari Managing Director Emerging Markets Equity Team Eric Carlson Head of Sustainability, Emerging Markets Equity Team", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/russia-invasion-of-ukraine.html"}
{"content": "Our expectation that financial market developments in 2022 would not be like 2021 did not take long to materialize! January was an eventful month, which led to even more interesting developments in early February, which are sure to have long-lasting effects. To recap January/early February: equities down, in many places quite sharply; credit spreads meaningfully wider; and, potentially most importantly, government bond yields up materially as central bankers, seemingly en masse, threw-in-the-towel on \u201ctransitory\u201d inflation. The practically coordinated global central bank pivot to accelerate monetary tightening (or, in central bank speak, removing accommodation) surprised the market which had anticipated a more sedate, orderly transition to rate hikes in the 2022/2023 period. This monetary policy conflagration impacted everything. The only assets not spilling red ink were oil, the U.S. dollar, Emerging Market (EM) local (surprising, yet not surprising), and bank loans. Last month we posed three questions: How impactful will Omicron be? Should markets fear the Fed? And, lastly, will inflation fall? While the surge in Omicron infections has no doubt hit economies, its impact still looks temporary, meaning lost output in Q1 2022 will likely be made up in later quarters. Labor markets remain resilient and, probably most importantly, central banks appear to be looking through it and not changing strategy. Indeed, some highly vaccinated European countries like Denmark and the UK are in the process of eliminating all COVID restrictions and returning to normal in terms of social distancing, vaccine requirements, mask-wearing etc. It remains uncertain if these health policy changes will spread and stick. But, for now, we can assume Omicron will fade as an issue for economic activity and policy behavior, except in China, which is a significant outlier. \u00d7 On the other hand, the outlook for central bank behavior has been upended. Not only has the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) not pushed back against the market pricing in multiple rate hikes in 2022, it has also effectively acknowledged that it has fallen behind the inflation curve (Chairman Powell said he was already marking up his end of year inflation forecast), necessitating a quicker than usual pivot from Quantitative Easing (QE) to Quantitative Tightening (QT \u2013 i.e. balance sheet run off). 2021 market expectations of three rate hikes shifted to five by early February, post FOMC meeting, and the possibility of hiking by 50 basis points (bps) at a meeting, rather than just 25 bps, has also been flagged. Indeed, Chairman Powell has gone out of his way to confirm that this tightening cycle will differ from the 2015-2018 cycle in several ways: rate hikes could occur faster as inflation is substantially above target rather than below and QT is unlikely to meaningfully lag rate hikes; employment is growing rapidly; wages are rising at their fastest pace in decades; inflation is picking up globally, so there is no offset from offshore deflationary pressures; and supply side issues, either on the goods or labor force participation rates, are NOT going away. If only it was the Fed acting hawkishly, it might not have been so bad. But the Fed was joined by the ECB, Bank of England, and the Bank of Canada in delivering more hawkish than expected messages or actions (in addition to the litany of emerging market central banks who continued to aggressively raise rates in January). In particular, the ECB was considered a dyed-in-the-wool dove, with no plans to raise rates or significantly reduce accommodation in 2022. Well, forget that. The ECB has caught the inflation worry bug and can no longer be expected to keep rates unchanged in 2022. It was only two months ago that analysts and the ECB were fairly convinced that there would be no need to raise rates until 2024! German government bond yields rose significantly in January as markets digested monetary policy developments. Net, net, central banks are getting their wish of tighter financial conditions before anyone has raised rates (outside of the UK, Norway and New Zealand, which have raised rates) by weakening financial markets. Lastly, the inflation outlook remains of paramount importance as central banks ARE responding to continued positive inflation surprises. There is good news and bad news on this front. First the good news. We believe inflation will come off the boil in the first quarter as energy inflation subsides. This will be the first drop in this expansion. The expected drop in developed market headline inflation does not mean that core inflation will drop, with inflation proving much stickier than anticipated. The trajectory of core inflation has been buffeted by both supply and demand shocks. While the demand should fall gradually in 2022, the supply side of economies are not recovering as anticipated. Energy prices in Europe, wages globally, but particularly in the U.S., are not behaving. As such, central bankers have adopted a much more hawkish posture to try to convince markets that inflation will not be allowed to become entrenched at a level meaningfully above medium-term targets. Core inflation should stabilize at a minimum, and hopefully fall, if only marginally, but this is not likely to happen until the end of Q1. Do not expect central banks to relieve pressure on markets in Q1. In terms of market views, we have been reducing portfolio risk given the uncertain outlook. We remain modestly long higher-yielding, shorter maturity assets (corporate credit, securitized credit, emerging markets). Economic growth should still be above trend in 2022; inflation will likely fall after the first quarter and, most importantly, we do not believe central banks want to create tight financial conditions; they want to get policy to neutral fairly quickly, but that should be it. Inflation is NOT completely demand-led and higher rates will not fix the supply side of the economy. We expect developed economy government bond yields to continue to move higher but, given how many rate hikes are now priced into yield curves, there could be some stability in the near term if inflation stabilizes. The risk is that it does not. \u00d7 Display 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date \uf065 Note: USD-based performance. Source: Bloomberg. Data as of January 31, 2022.

Fixed Income Outlook January was a difficult month for financial markets. Two intertwined factors drove performance: inflation and central banks. Inflation data continued to surprise on the upside across both the developed and emerging markets. As a result, central banks continue to talk more hawkishly than before. Yields rose everywhere: on government bonds, corporate bonds, emerging market bonds, securitized assets. There was no real \u201csafe haven\u201d in fixed income assets except cash and floating rate products like loans. Whether or not this continues for the rest of 2022 will depend crucially on how this inflation/central bank dialectic plays out. Before getting into inflation and monetary policy, Omicron issues need to be dealt with. While we and many others were concerned about how the Omicron infection wave would impact markets, it does not look like it will be a major force in the months ahead. This is not to say it has not been impactful. It has. Recent economic data in Europe and North America has been negatively impacted. But crucially this should be temporary without having longer-term repercussions. Thus, positive trends in economic data should reassert themselves, as should current central bank behavior. Despite an expected weakening of economic activity in 2022, growth should remain well above trend in most countries, crucially in the Eurozone and United States. This is supportive for corporate and government cash flows and supportive of corporate credit in general. The widening in spreads seen so far in 2022 increases their relative attractiveness but we are leery of adding to exposure just yet. Importantly, whether this expected strong cash flow year materializes will depend heavily on the inflation outlook. For if inflation does not fall as anticipated by central banks (and the market), monetary policy settings may need to be moved to a restrictive setting with all the negative ramifications the word implies. So, what about inflation? Unfortunately, high, and persistent levels of inflation have triggered changes in monetary policy expectations. The trend of central banks globally reducing accommodation is intensifying relative to what was expected a short while ago. The aggressive repricing of short rates, none the more surprising to the market than in the Eurozone. German 5-year yields rose 23 bps in January and another 26bps in the first four days of February to their highest level since 2018! Now that is a repricing. While U.S. Treasury yields have also risen significantly this year (10-year maturities up 40 bps through February 4), they are only getting back to where they were pre-pandemic. If economies are truly returning to \u201cnormal,\u201d there is no reason NOT to expect monetary policy settings to revert to \u201cnormal.\u201d But, if inflation dynamics prove to be stubborn, central banks may need to push policy settings to restrictive territory, reinforcing the natural economic slowdown occurring in 2022, risking a rising probability of a recession in 2023/2024. Certainly, markets are testing central banks\u2019 commitment to capping/reducing inflation this year by pricing more aggressive rate tightening cycles, including in the Eurozone. Importantly, central banks have not pushed back at all on market pricing. But a disconnect between central banks and the market does exist with regard to how high rates must go to achieve lower and at-target inflation. One of the biggest surprises in 2021 was the decline in real yields. This year the surprise has been the other way around. Real yields have risen substantially and much faster than anticipated. But, unfortunately, they will likely have to move higher still in 2022 if they are to return markets to \u201cnormal\u201d pricing, consistent with medium term growth expectations. The real 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, while already rising 53 bps this year through February 4, is still significantly negative. This is a very pessimistic forecast and one unlikely to be true if secular stagnation does not return (although we cannot completely dismiss the possibility). The depressed state of real yields is a function of a variety of factors that should dissipate in importance, like excessively easy monetary policy. Importantly, the Fed needs real yields to rise to slow inflation. How high they need to go will depend on the financial market\u2019s reaction. The more long-term yields rise, the less tightening is required from the Fed. The expected move to begin QT this year adds an element of uncertainty as markets do not have much experience in handicapping a higher rates/QT combo (nor does the Fed). Therefore, nominal, and real yields should move higher in 2022 as liquidity is withdrawn, the economy slows and inflation falls. With the global central bank \u201cpeloton\u201d moving together, constraints on any one country\u2019s monetary policy or level of yields is relaxed. For instance, one reason U.S. yields remained so low in 2021 (and previous years) was the huge amount of negative yielding bonds in the world. U.S. yields were high by global standards, encouraging capital inflows, capping yields. With all bond yields moving higher and global central banks tightening policy somewhat synchronously, there is more scope for ALL yields worldwide to rise. Indeed, the rise in Eurozone yields is particularly important given the extent to which euro-denominated investors have historically chased higher yields in other markets. This is an important reason why bond yields could surprise the market to the upside, assuming central banks follow through on their tightening agendas, which depends on how inflation behaves. There is a lot of front-loaded tightening priced into almost all developed market yield curves. Whether or not this happens will depend crucially on how inflation behaves through March, and eventually beyond. The pace of tightening is not the only thing to worry about. One crucial factor keeping longer maturity yields relatively low is expectations that terminal rates, i.e., the peak in policy rates, will not reach new highs. Indeed, current market expectations are that peak rates this cycle will be meaningfully lower than last cycle (2015-2018). The risk to bond valuations is that this is wrong. The Fed, for example, thinks short rates will peak around 2.5%, much higher than what the bond market is currently pricing. With inflation proving to be stubborn, there is a danger that expected terminal rates will have to be adjusted higher by both the market and Fed. There is also the risk that the reversing of QE programmes will impact longer maturity bonds in particular, given that the original rationale of many of these programmes was to drive long-dated yields lower. That said, we believe inflation will fall in 2022, growth in output and employment will slow, and the Fed will calibrate its tightening cycle as more information arrives. It may be true that this is just an inflation scare. By mid-year, when we know more about how fast inflation is falling, the Fed will be able to slow down its tightening. Of course, the opposite is true as well. In the interim, it will be hard to fight the Fed! Credit investors have become more nervous recently, causing credit spreads to widen; we think this is reflective of how tight spreads have become, anticipated reductions in liquidity and the anticipated Fed (and other central bank) tightening, rather than any meaningful increase in default or cash flow risks. Further widening could be a buying opportunity but we will need to see some stability, if not outright falls, in inflation to be confident. EM local market risk is improving as central banks get a handle on the inflation situation. Very hawkish central banks, with inflation pressures still evident, make it premature to get bullish, despite significant rate hikes in recent months. But this could change by the end of the quarter when more evidence is available on the global inflation trend. Where does this leave our views on markets? In general, we remain overweight shorter-maturity higher yielding sectors. We think high yield (HY), securitized credit and floating-rate loans will outperform government bonds, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and investment grade credit, but by less than in 2021. We think low expected terminal rates and negative real yields make longer-maturity bonds relatively unappealing. We do not think a return to neutral Fed policy is something to be overly concerned with. However, this outcome is contingent on the Fed not overdoing it, either on purpose or by accident. If markets sense recession risks rising, performance rankings will flip with investment grade and government bonds expected to outperform. Local EM looks interesting given how much central banks have raised rates. On the external side, we are more selective, but do expect high yielding sovereign bonds to reverse their 2021 underperformance. Once inflation peaks, substantial risk premiums should fall. Shorter maturity bonds are more interesting due to much higher risk premiums now priced in. How China manages their zero-COVID strategy will also be impactful both on the demand and supply sides. Developed Market Rate/Foreign Currency Monthly Review The year did not start quietly for developed market rates. In January, yields rose broadly following further hawkish sentiment from central bankers. Additionally, inflation worries continued and geopolitical concerns arose. Pressured by higher discount factors given increased rates and demanding valuations, risk assets sold off considerably. Regarding COVID, data continues to indicate that the Omicron variant is a dwindling threat. The U.S. dollar rose slightly during January.1 Outlook Central bank policy will continue to dominate markets going forward. While a more hawkish bias has been confirmed, there is still speculation about just how quickly central banks could tighten, with the Fed and others indicating they may be happy to raise rates quicker than 100 bps per year, as was typical in the previous rate hiking cycle. Overall, we see value in many emerging market currencies vs. G10, but many still have elevated risks. Amongst G10 currencies, we see limited valuation differences. Emerging Market Rate/Foreign Currency Monthly Review Broad market volatility impacted the hard-currency segments of the market, as spreads widened for both sovereign and corporate credit, and the move higher in U.S. Treasury yields had a direct hit. Local currency was essentially flat and outperformed most other areas of markets. Local sovereign debt were still negative,2 as was U.S. dollar-denominated corporate debt.3 U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign debt was also down. The asset class experienced outflows, with approximately -$2.2 billion net in January.4 Outlook We remain constructive on the emerging markets, given the balance of fundamentals and valuations. Fundamentals appear stable, with global growth and trade continuing their rebounds, albeit at a slower rate. Many central banks across EM have tightened policy well ahead of the Fed and other developed markets, and inflation appears to have potentially peaked in many spots. COVID continues to be a challenge for many EM countries, but potential \u201clockdown\u201d policy responses would be the most impactful for markets and, so far, appear unlikely in most areas. Corporate Credit Monthly Review Investment grade credit spreads widened in January due to the volatility in risk markets. The news was dominated by a number of negative themes that drove sentiment \u2013 continued high inflation, Russia-Ukraine geo-political risks, and Omicron.5 The high yield market began the year with the worst return for the month of January on record. A continuation of hawkish messaging from the Fed was the primary catalyst. Treasury yields leapt, credit spreads generally widened and fixed rate products sold-off.6 Global convertibles had the worst start to a year on record as investors weighed the impact of rates rising on growth stocks. Energy names performed best along with Financials, while Technology, Communications and Consumer Discretionary fared the worst.7 Outlook We expect Investment Grade (IG) credit to trade in a range earning carry with limited capital gains from spread tightening. We continue to expect volatility in early 2022 given the current uncertainty and lack of appetite for risk positioning. Floating-Rate Loans Monthly Review Loan returns for January were favorable relative to other areas of investor portfolios, as U.S. stocks, high-grade and high-yield bonds sold off sharply during the month on expectations of rising interest rates. Results were strongest in the opening half of January as the market carried over momentum from the end of 2021, later easing in the second half of the month as market volatility increased.8 Outlook We expect continued strong technicals and fundamentals. Above-trend economic growth, the likelihood of declining inflation levels, and the possibility of Fed rate hikes should all play into an investment narrative that supports the loan allocation and thus provides support for current valuations. At the same time, broad-based improvements in credit metrics, a very low default outlook and a likely continued strong technical tone in the asset class should serve as helpful forces as well. Securitized Products Monthly Review Agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) underperformed in January with spreads almost reverting to pre-pandemic levels as the market anticipates the end of quantitative easing and potentially the beginning of quantitative tightening. The spike in rates volatility and lengthening durations from rising mortgage rates are also weighing on the sector. Non-agency Residential MBS (RMBS), Commercial MBS (CMBS) and Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) spreads were generally wider during the month, however performance varied by sub-sector.9 Outlook We believe the securitized market still offers a unique combination of low duration, attractive yields and solid credit fundamentals. We remain constructive on securitized credit and have a modest credit overweight across our portfolios. We remain cautious on agency MBS and interest rate risk, and we continue to manage the portfolios with relatively short durations. \u00d7 1 Source: Bloomberg.

There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. \u00d7 Global Fixed Income Team Our fixed income investment capabilities are driven by eight specialized teams \u2013 Agency MBS, Emerging Markets, Floating-Rate Loans, High Yield, Investment Grade Credit, Municipals, Multi-Sector, and Securitized \u2013 which span the global fixed income capital markets.

{"content": "The US Equity Market: Seems to me what\u2019s transpired year-to-date is a microcosm of what\u2019s to come for the year. It\u2019s a close battle between the positives and negatives. The equity market convulsed when we heard from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in January. His decidedly more hawkish tone sent shivers through the equity markets. Remember, at this stage of an economic recovery, it is not that unusual for the Federal Reserve to begin shifting policy and reducing liquidity. Tightening financial conditions weigh on equities, especially the more speculative stocks. However, the fourth quarter earnings reports for corporate America was good news overall. Clearly the earnings misses get the headlines, nevertheless, consensus earnings estimates for the S&amp;P 500 for 2021, 2022 and 2023 are higher today than they were at the end of 2021.1 Overall, corporate America is healthier than Wall Street has expected.2 Throw in the resumption of strong company stock buybacks, and there is your good news for stocks. Seems to me, this battle might be with us for most of the year. As I have articulated, this type of environment is not unusual for the third year of an economic recovery. In the end, Applied Equity Advisors believes 2022 will be an \u2018ok\u2019 year for the market return overall, just not as strong as what we\u2019ve seen the last few.3 Despite lower returns, 2022 will offer more opportunities for tactical alpha generation at the allocation level. We\u2019ve already seen this. By the third week of January, the market seemed completely focused on the bad news and had dropped over 10% peak to trough. That offered a buying opportunity, as shortly thereafter the market recovered on strong earnings reports. \u00d7 \" Don\u2019t let the bears scare you out of taking advantage of the selloffs, and, likewise, don\u2019 chase when there is too much market strength.* We believe it should be a \u2018reversion to the mean\u2019 type year. AEA Style Positioning: We remain committed to a value bias in the US, for two reasons: Value stocks are always cheaper, but in recessions they get very cheap. Post recessions, they trade back to a normalized level. They are not at that level yet.4 We think the economy could be moving into a period of permanent higher inflation. More like the 1960s\u2026higher growth/higher inflation, the antithesis of the period of 2010- 2019. In that environment, we think inflation-sensitive stocks, which reside in the value bucket, could outperform for an extended period. However, we are less negative on growth than we have been, given the magnitude of underperformance of growth stocks. As we have discussed, in many ways the chase into growth/technology stocks post the COVID lows reminded us of the NASDAQ bubble of 2000. We felt that the uber growth stocks were trading at the same levels of extreme valuation.5 Once the bubble pricked it was going to be ugly, which it has been.6 However, the more established mega-cap technology stocks never traded to the same frenzied level. That is how the environment today is different than it was in the year 2000. Recent underperformance despite numerous impressive earnings reports means many of these large-cap growth names are now trading at very reasonable valuations. We would NOT recommend selling growth here. 3. The one group that continues to appear expensive to us are the defensive stocks.7 Bull markets don\u2019t tend to end with investors willing to pay such premiums for relative safety. AEA Geographic Positioning: 1. We regularly hear the calls from strategists that this will finally be the year to favor Europe over the US. It is true that Europe is cheaper and has more of a value bias. However, it\u2019s one thing to make broad general calls like this and yet another to actually pull the trigger and reallocate assets out of the US to Europe. Simply put, as an investor would you be comfortable selling Berkshire Hathaway, the largest US financial, to buy HSBC, the largest European financial? Would you sell Adobe to buy SAP or Amazon to buy Siemens?8 We certainly find some European stocks attractive, but I question jettisoning superior-performing companies for lesser ones, just because \u201cthey are cheaper\u201d.9 2. The region of the world that has seen companies compound at rates competitive with great US companies is Asia ex-Japan.10 While that region woefully lagged in 2021, causing a drag on our performance for our global strategies, we continue to believe this is a better allocation for non-US assets than in Europe (or Japan for that matter). Simply put, we believe finding great companies that are temporarily out of favor a far more enduring strategy than investing in laggard companies, hopeful that better results are to come. \u00d7 1 On December 31st, 2021, the consensus estimates, according to Factset, for 2021, 2022 and 2023 were $204.95, $223.46 and $245.01. As of February 10, 2022, they are $207.79, $224.89, and $247.53. 2 The bears love to point out that \u201cthe earnings revision ratio is peaking\u201d. I have heard this doomsday call since early last year, but the positive earnings beats simply continue. To me, looking at the second derivative of earnings reports and trying to project the future is dubious. It\u2019s like saying that the Golden State Warriors are having a bad year, because while they have the second-best record in the NBA, they are not \u201cwinning by the same percentage as last year\u201d. A win is a win, just like an earnings beat is an earnings beat. 3 A high single-digit returning year would be historically consistent with the third year off the mid-recession bear market low. While I am not a strategist and don\u2019t regularly set price targets for the S&amp;P 500, a 5,100 year-end S&amp;P 500 would imply an approximate 8.1% total return for the year off a 4,779 start to 2022. 4 While value stocks have certainly done well recently, as they did in the second half of 2020, they did not outperform in 2021, as measured by Russell Growth compared to Russell Value indexes. Bloomberg. 5 The fifty fastest growing stocks in the Russell 1000 traded to an even higher valuation in 2021 than they had at the NASDAQ peak in 2000. Factset. 6 At its low in late January, the ARK Innovation ETF was off -57% from its high. Bloomberg. 7 The earnings stability factor, a measure of defensive earnings resilience, now trades at two standard deviations expensive relative to where it has traded for the past 26 years. 8 For example only. None of these securities are owned in AEA active strategies. 9 As of this writing, Berkshire Hathaway has compounded at a 15.06% annualized return for the last decade. HSBC is only at 3.17%. Adobe has compounded at 31.90%, while SAP at 8.75%. Amazon has compounded at 33.05% while Siemens at 8.75%. As measured in US dollars. Bloomberg. 10 From 2010-2020, the three largest stocks in the MSCI Asia ex Japan Index compounded at an average annualized return of 25.77%. In 2021, they returned -5.61% on average. Bloomberg. * At the low of January 27, 2022, the SPX was off 10% from the high. At that level, a year-end target of 5,100 offered 18% upside. But at the high on January 3rd of 4,797, there was only 6% upside to 5,100. \u00d7 Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Andrew Slimmon Head of Applied Equity Advisors Team Featured Funds Global Concentrated Portfolio MLNIX | Class I Global Core Portfolio MLMIX | Class I US Core Portfolio MUOIX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/equity-market-commentary-feb-2022.html"}
{"content": "Climate change is everyone\u2019s business. Having engaged on the issue with 95% of the companies in their global strategies, the International Equity Team discusses holding companies to account. \u00d7 In 2021 we launched a carbon transition engagement programme across our global strategies. Our aim was to assess each holding\u2019s climate risks and opportunities, understand their climate profiles and encourage improvement. We did this to ascertain our portfolios\u2019 resilience to a low-carbon future. We engaged with 95% of all the companies we hold across our global strategies, a level far above the industry average for corporate engagement (according to a recent report by the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment, which suggests the average level is just 19% of holdings).1 Positive outcomes have followed. Six out of seven companies we own that initially didn\u2019t have targets are now either preparing to set them or have them in place, and nine companies advanced their existing target ambitions to be carbon neutral or net zero. Broadly, at the outset of 2021, an average 54% of our holdings across our global strategies had set net zero targets or better. By the [CE(1] end of the year, this average had risen to 71%. For contrast, according to a report by Oxford University2 covering Forbes 2000 companies globally, only 21% have net zero targets. Climate change is now everyone\u2019s business. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group 1\u2019s Physical Science Basis report maintains it is still possible to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C, but only if the world acts now.3 In our opinion, tackling climate change is not only the right thing to do; it also makes business sense. Our message to companies we engage with is clear: failure to address carbon emissions is now risky business. Companies face the danger their emissions will be taxed and regulated, and they risk their competitive position, their physical assets, their reputation, their profits, their valuation and maybe even their future. For investors, evaluating corporate carbon emissions risk is now a fundamental cog in the wheel of security analysis and stock selection. The high quality, company-level information we look for is only available from targeted engagement, not simply from third-party providers. Engagement is the hallmark of our integrated environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment process. We conducted 143 ESG-related engagements overall in 2021. By engagement, we\u2019re not talking box ticking via emails, anonymous group meetings or \u201cspeed-dating\u201d conferences. We prefer one-on-one dialogue with management and senior company ESG specialists. Because of our size and long-term holding periods, we have the luxury of excellent access. While there are always going to be one or two outliers that are hard to meet, we are proud to say we met with nearly all our global holdings to exclusively discuss carbon in 2021. Targeted Engagement to Drive Outcomes The type of engagement we seek varies, depending on where in the climate maturity matrix an individual company sits. It could be helping kickstart their carbon journey, seeking better transparency and accountability, or challenging well-meant targets that may lack credible pathways. For those already on the right track in terms of their disclosure, targets and actions, we use engagement to both track performance and encourage continued leadership. The outcomes we\u2019re looking for (or the risks) vary by industry. Following our first carbon-specific meeting with a quality industrial/technology holding that initially had no targets or carbon ambitions, the company invited us to engage with both them and a consultant around our views on best practice and investor expectations. In turn, this will help them formulate their carbon strategy \u2013 an outcome, in our view, that demonstrates the effectiveness of targeted engagement. In a different industry, with a company we hold in consumer credit reporting, we challenged why environmental and social targets were not included in their management incentives. They acknowledged the changing circumstances, telling us that it is now actively being discussed internally. Staying with the theme of changing circumstances, in the context of Scope 1 emissions we asked how they were measuring the CO2 footprint of staff now working from home, and the impact of a likely different working model going forward. We also challenged them on the merits of having data centres located in Texas, given heating and cooling is a significant component of their emissions. Again, they are actively considering their position here. Engagement isn\u2019t just about challenging policies or targets; we also look to explore climate-related opportunities. Here, positive outcomes may be more distant given some initiatives are relatively recent, but they could well become more significant in time. One of our leading global exchange groups sees regulatory change as positive, with related \u201cnew projects popping up everywhere\u201d. In their view, they\u2019re ideally placed to create trading products in regulated markets. For another of our companies (one of the world\u2019s leading management consultancies), their global partnerships with many of the world\u2019s leading companies, combined with a client base which in some instances is also part of their supply network, puts them in a unique position to advance sustainable initiatives. On the supplier side, as part of the company\u2019s goal to reach net zero by 2025, they aim for 90% of their key suppliers to disclose their environmental targets. On the partnering side, in a joint venture working with the world\u2019s leading software company, the company is helping U.K. utility and energy companies transform the energy system and lower the cost of decarbonising the supply and demand of electricity in the U.K. This is underpinned by open data, artificial intelligence and equipping a workforce with digital skills. In our engagement with them, we pressed them on why environmental targets were not included in management incentives, while diversity and inclusion were. They have taken our suggestion on board for internal discussion. The Programme Ahead Having completed the first phase of our programme, our plan for 2022 is to continue to advocate for better outcomes in four focus areas: (i) improved transparency and disclosure; (ii) the strengthening of targets to net zero and the adoption of science-based targets and Scope 3, where missing; (iii) better alignment of management incentives, pressing for environmental and social targets to be tied to executive compensation in order to drive their fulfilment; and (iv) moving the conversation onto nature-based solutions and physical asset risk. Climate change is not something that can be tackled by an individual or small group, no matter how determined or engaged they are. But what we can do is continue to hold our companies to account, pushing for and encouraging change. What never changes is our relentless focus on owning high quality compounders at reasonable valuations. Time and again over the last 25 years, investing in companies with these characteristics has proven valuable during truly testing times, from the dot-com boom and bust at the beginning of the century, to economic recessions and, most recently, the global pandemic. Their relative resilience has shown through when it has been needed most. The strong underlying economics we prize \u2013 the steady compounding of profits over time at high returns on operating capital \u2013 are the high quality fundamentals that we continue to believe will help set the best course for attractive returns in the long term. \u00d7 Nic Sochovsky Managing Director International Equity Team Vladimir Demine Head of ESG Research International Equity Team Alistair Corden-Lloyd Executive Director Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/climate-change-everyones-business.html"}

{"content": "Key 2022 Macroeconomic Issues COVID-19 Transition From Pandemic to Endemic Our base case is that COVID-19 will transition from pandemic to endemic in 2022, with 2023 likely the first full normal year since 2019. Two years after the first cases of COVID-19, the world still faces tsunamis of new infections with no apparent end in sight. And while COVID-19 continues to have an outsized impact on financial assets\u2014for example, bond market performance in the past nine months has been better explained by infection numbers than inflation, growth, or the Fed\u2014countries, populations and governments are reacting more moderately to new waves of infections, with targeted measures such as vaccination campaigns and mandates, with masking and selective quarantines thus reducing the economic impacts of each successive wave. Indeed, current data suggests Omicron is twice as infectious as Delta, though its deadliness is lower. And though 2022 may see a few more waves, each could be of lessening severity given the improvement in the availability of medical tools in the developed world such as triple-dose vaccines, antiviral therapeutics and treatment, as well as the protection afforded by prior natural infection. Of course, the uncertainty around this base case remains enormous and, as such, well reflected in the prices of direct plays on an end to COVID, Working from Home and on full re-opening of the global economy. From Overheating to Stagflation While we still expect above-trend growth for most of 2022, by the end of 2022, the economy will likely slow to or below trend. We believe the economy entered the Overheating phase of the economic cycle in mid-2021. The GMA Team defines Overheating as above-trend growth, a closed output gap and rising inflation. The global economy grew at 5.8% in 2021,1 more than double its trend growth rate, and the output gap is now nearly closed with labor markets in many countries within the range of NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment). Inflation is now above central bank targets virtually everywhere. We expect Overheating to persist before the Stagflationary phase takes over in the second half. We define Stagflation as an environment where growth has decelerated to or below potential, but where inflation is above target and rising. For the U.S., sub-2% growth and 2.5%-3.0% inflation\u2014which we expect by year-end 2022 - qualifies as Stagflation. Why the shift from Overheating in the first half to Stagflation by year-end 2022? In the first half of the year, contributors to growth will win the tug-of-war against detractors, but by the end of the year detractors will gain the upper hand. The main boosts to economic growth include: continued re-opening; the public to private sector hand-off as fiscal stimulus fades; still-easy monetary policy, with negative real rates everywhere in the developed world; easing supply shortages; and consumption, as approximately 15% of the $2.5 trillion of U.S. household excess savings will be spent in 2022 (with similarly large magnitudes across the world).2 Offsetting these growth boosts the following are likely to detract from growth in the latter part of 2022: The U.S. fiscal cliff, which could detract -250 basis points from U.S. GDP; the latest COVID variant, Omicron, which will hit growth in the first quarter and may delay the eventual economic normalization we expect over 2022 and into 2023; and the end of free money which will likely slow economic activity with a lag. Inflation: Partially Transitory, Partially Structural After taking two steps forward in 2021, inflation will take a step back in 2022 as the prices of core goods normalize. However structural forces have likely ended the disinflation cycle of the past forty years as the world enters a more inflationary regime akin to the late 1960s (but not like the 1970s). Core inflation has accelerated to 5%. But a very high proportion of current inflation is supply-shortage driven and thus likely to be temporary. For example, over half the acceleration in core inflation has been driven by car prices. On the other hand, inflation has broadened: median inflation, the best measure of the breadth of inflation, now points to an underlying trend in core CPI of 3.0% (from a low of 1.5% just a year ago). Many structural trends support a regime shift to higher inflation. Unlike in the prior cycle where printed money accumulated as commercial banks\u2019 excess reserves at the Fed, in this cycle, the money printed was spent. In addition, improved bargaining power for workers, as well as changes in attitudes and demands of workers, point to higher inflation. There is also building evidence of \u201cgreenflation,\u201d with decarbonization (net-zero emissions by 2050) adding as much 80-100 basis points to developed markets\u2019 consumer price inflation in each the next ten years by some estimates. Importantly, unlike in the decade following the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), no deleveraging in the banking, household and corporate sectors is occurring, removing a significant source of deflation. The End of Free Money Over the past two years, the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England collectively printed over US$11 trillion (about 26% of their GDP), more than double the amount which was printed after the GFC in half of the time.3 At the same time, these four central banks cut rates to (or below) zero. Money became literally free and enormous quantities of it were (and still are) floating around. Governments availed themselves of this free money and spent more in 2020-21 than at any time since World War II.4 The combination has been explosive for economies and markets, particularly because the Fed can print money, but cannot control where it goes. All this is now reversing. Most central banks are already tapering their bond purchases or are about to. A few have started raising rates \u2013 most recently the Bank of England. For its part, the Fed has started tapering quantitative easing (QE) purchases, expects to raise rates three times in 2022, and is even starting to discuss QT (quantitative tightening, i.e. shrinking its enormous nearly $9 trillion balance sheet). Free money has been an elixir for markets. What happens when money is no longer free? The End of China\u2019s Exceptionalism China has grown at an extraordinary pace of 9% for four decades.5 In fact, many predicted China would overtake the U.S. as the largest economy in the world by 2020. Though China has had an outsized impact on the global economy, driving approximately 28% of global growth in the past decade, its economy is still 23% smaller than that of the U.S. and its growth is likely to severely downshift to 4% or less for the following three reasons: 1) China has \u201cgotten old before getting rich,\u201d with its working age population estimated to have peaked in 2010, and its total population likely starting to shrink outright in 2023;6 2) China has already built out its infrastructure and housing and thus cannot keep investing at the same pace. Further capital deepening will become debt-funded malinvestment, as the property sector\u2019s recent troubles show; and 3) President Xi Jinping, in consolidating power around himself, is in the process strangling the golden goose responsible for the Chinese growth miracle of the past forty years. Key 2022 Investment Themes Speculative Mania Bursts In the ten years before COVID-19 hit, U.S. and global stocks rose in one of the biggest and longest bull markets of the past century.7 But interestingly stocks did not show signs of generalized frothiness usually associated with long bull markets. Then in the eighteen months following the COVID-19 low in March 2020, from a near standstill, most market participants caught the bit in their teeth and pushed almost every measure of speculative enthusiasm to record levels: IPO funds raised went from $32 billion annually from 2009 to 2019 to a record $262 billion in 2021 (nearly four times the 2000 record of $65bn).8 M&amp;A activity went from $1.25 trillion annually in the last decade to $2.75 trillion in 2021.9 Inflows into equity mutual funds and ETFs reached $1 trillion in 2021, more than the past twenty years combined and significantly exceeding 2000\u2019s $312 billion.10 Margin debt has doubled from the average of the past five years to reach more than 2% of GDP, much higher than the 2000\u2019s when it was 1.4% of GDP.11 The meme stock craze of early 2020 has ebbed with many stocks down -50% from their peaks, but their market caps are still 10 to 20 times higher than pre-COVID-19 levels in 2019 despite revenues down 20 to 50% and no profits.12 History shows that these speculative manias tend not to last much more than eighteen months, and are followed by market corrections greater than -40%, unwinding almost all of the bubble\u2019s gains. Highly speculative and expensive assets are most at risk: the crypto ecosystem, retail/ meme stocks, no-profits stocks, hypergrowth high-multiple stocks and probably growth stocks in general. There are already indications that some of the bubbliest areas in the market have burst, though the overall market continues to make new highs, powered by an increasingly small number of mega-cap stocks. Possible catalysts for a more generalized market correction include The End of Free Money, the fiscal cliff and Stagflation. Or it may just be that stock market optimism and expectations are so high that they are very unlikely to ever be met. The Value Bull Market Is Only Getting Started Value stocks in the U.S. and globally have entered a structural bull market, in which they could outperform growth stocks by as much as 100% over the next five to seven years. If one properly defines Value (the way the Global Multi-Asset team believes it does: by removing sector/industry bias, equal weighting each stock, and focusing on the cheapest quintile of stocks), Value has outperformed Anti-Value (i.e. the most expensive quintile of stocks) by +26% since April 2020. We believe this marks the beginning of an uptrend, which is mirrored by our global measures of Value: Value outside the U.S. has outperformed Anti-Value by +28% since its low in 2020.13 Nonetheless, Value remains nearly the cheapest it has ever been. Today, U.S. Value stocks trade at 11x forward earnings, with Anti-Value stocks at 37x. This is well below the average historical relative discount of Value stocks to Anti-Value. If relative multiples returned to historical averages the result would be a 69% re-rating for Value stocks. The likely catalyst for this normalization would be higher inflation and the end of quantitative easing and zero interest rates, which would be favorable for Value stocks\u2019 fundamentals as well as their valuations relative to longer-duration Anti-Value stocks. The Rise of the Rest (of the World) For the past ten years, the U.S. stock market benefited from the best of all worlds compared to its foreign peers and, as a result, has spectacularly outperformed. U.S. stocks rallied +428% cumulatively since 2010 with non-U.S. stocks up only +96% in USD terms, a +332% outperformance.14 Non-U.S. developed equities are now trading at a record -30% discount to U.S. equities, and emerging markets ex-China equities are trading at a -43% discount (approaching the Asian Crisis low of 47%), on relative forward P/E.15 Many factors supported U.S. outperformance, most of which are likely in the process of reversing. Back in 2010, U.S. equities stood near 15-year lows relative to the Rest of the World on price-to-book valuations.16 In addition, the U.S. dollar was the cheapest it had been since the early 1970s. During the 2010s, U.S. economic growth was double that of emerging markets ex-China (in real US$ terms) and 50% faster than that of other developed economies (in real terms). Partially as a result, U.S. listed company profits were up +376%, massively outpacing Rest of the World profits of +123% (in U.S. dollar terms).17 Non-U.S. regions were buffeted by economic and political crises such as the eurozone peripheral crisis, the Fragile Five18 emerging economies in 2013, the Oil Collapse of 2014, the China Devaluation in 2015, and Brexit in 2016, as well as various political crises in Brazil and other emerging markets, while the U.S. remained relatively stable. U.S. companies benefited from a corporate tax cut as well as its sector mix. U.S. tech and internet stocks made up of 19% of U.S. benchmarks in 2010 and ended at 40% in 2021.19 Meanwhile, in the rest of the world, tech and internet stocks were just 7% of market cap (in 2010 and now). This benefited U.S. stocks as tech and internet outperformed the rest of the U.S. market by +448%.20 Looking forward, most of the above factors are no longer as favorable: U.S. equities have the highest relative valuations in history vs. the Rest of the World and the U.S. dollar is expensive (though not extreme). From their current record-high levels, U.S. corporate margins are more likely to suffer downside pressure from labor costs, taxes, regulation and the possible re-shoring of supply chains. Lastly, a high tech and internet index weighting was very helpful in one of the biggest Growth bull markets in history, but these sectors are likely to suffer from the end of the pandemic boost to digital and virtual activities, high valuations and excessive profits expectations, greater regulation and anti-trust enforcement, and the incipient signs of potential excessive capital investment. Economic prospects still may favor the U.S. over the rest of developed markets but even there, the U.S. is starting to face many of the same problems as its peers (e.g. increasing size of government, expansion of the welfare safety net, slower population growth etc.). Commodities Still Beat Stocks and Bonds Commodities had a very strong year in 2021\u2014as is typical during the Overheating phase of the cycle\u2014rallying 33%.21 As mentioned, we expect to remain in the Overheating phase for a few more quarters before transitioning to Stagflation. Historically commodities have been the best performing asset class during Stagflation. While commodities\u2019 financialization in the past two decades mean they are more sensitive to a risk-off environment even if fundamentals remain strong, and China (where growth is slowing) has become a bigger source of demand for most commodities than the U.S. except for oil, two structural factors should keep commodities well-supported. First, severe underinvestment in oil &amp; gas, as well as in most other industrial metals and bulks. Oil investment globally peaked at $779 billion in 2014 and in 2020 fell as low as $328 billion, and global mining capex peaked at roughly $160 billion annually in 2012-2013 and has averaged roughly $80 billion annually from 2016-2020.22 Second, decarbonization might require enormous quantities of some commodities which current production (and future production at current investment levels) would be incapable of meeting, thus causing \u201cgreenflation\u201d (inflation in commodities required for the electrification and greening of the global economy). \u00d7 1 Haver Analytics 2 MSIM Global Multi-Asset team estimates; Haver; Factset. 3 MSIM Global Multi-Asset team analysis; Haver.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also \ufb02uctuate in response to activities speci\ufb01c to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. High yield securities (\u201cjunk bonds\u201d) are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities (MBS and ABS) are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and dif\ufb01cult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Portfolio, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Real estate investment trusts are subject to risks similar to those associated with the direct ownership of real estate and they are sensitive to such factors as management skills and changes in tax laws. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the Portfolio\u2019s performance. Illiquid securities may be more dif\ufb01cult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). By investing in investment company securities, the portfolio is subject to the underlying risks of that investment company's portfolio securities. In addition to the Portfolio's fees and expenses, the Portfolio generally would bear its share of the investment company's fees and expenses. Subsidiary and tax risk the Portfolio may seek to gain exposure to the commodity markets through investments in the Subsidiary or commodity index-linked structured notes. The Subsidiary is not registered under the 1940 Act and is not subject to all the investor protections of the 1940 Act. Historically, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") has issued private letter rulings in which the IRS speci\ufb01cally concluded that income and gains from investments in commodity index-linked structured notes or a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary that invests in commodity-linked instruments are \"qualifying income\" for purposes of compliance with Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). The Portfolio has not received such a private letter ruling, and is not able to rely on private letter rulings issued to other taxpayers. If the Portfolio failed to qualify as a regulated investment company, it would be subject to federal and state income tax on all of its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates with no deduction for any distributions paid to shareholders, which would signi\ufb01cantly adversely affect the returns to, and could cause substantial losses for, Portfolio shareholders. Cryptocurrency (notably, Bitcoin) operates as a decentralized, peer-to-peer financial exchange and value storage that is used like money. It is not backed by any government. Federal, state or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency may experience very high volatility. LIBOR Discontinuance or Unavailability Risk. The regulatory authority that oversees financial services firms and financial markets in the U.K. has announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions for purposes of determining the LIBOR rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022 , LIBOR may no longer be available or no longer deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on or impacting certain derivatives and other instruments or investments comprising some of the Fund\u2019s portfolio. \u00d7 Cyril Moulle-Berteaux Head of Global Multi-Asset Team Global Multi-Asset Team Sergei Parmenov Managing Director Global Multi-Asset Team", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/2022-global-multi-asset-team-outlook.html"}

{"content": "The inevitability of change remains constant with central bank monetary policy, global money market reform, and technological advances expected to drive changes in 2022. In the U.S., we expect the Federal Reserve to end tapering by mid-March and announce four rate hikes over the course of the new year. In a potentially rising rate environment, efficient cash management is critical to maximizing economics, both through the investments themselves and technology solutions. \u00d7 Introduction Bob Dylan\u2019s classic song, \u201cThe Times They Are A-Changin\u201d summoned listeners to look around and recognize that although change is an inevitable and unstoppable force, we are each called to action to adopt. Dylan\u2019s lyrics are certain to resonate with treasury managers as they face major changes in monetary policy, money market funds (MMFs) regulations, sustainability practices, and technology. How cash investors adopt to the onslaught of change may very well determine their success in 2022 and beyond. Market Overview Last Fall demonstrated just how quickly change can take place. At the time, financial markets were awash in liquidity, LIBOR was at an all-time low, and there was one Fed interest rate hike on the horizon in late 2022. But in response to persistently elevated prices, the Fed altered their stance on inflation, no longer viewing it as \u201ctransitory\u201d but admitting \u201cthat prices have remained higher for longer than expected.\u201d At the same time, they announced plans to end their asset purchase program sooner than expected, opening the door for a series of interest rates increases beginning as early as March. The Fed\u2019s current projections suggest three rate hikes this year, another three in 2023, and two more in 2024. Our expectation is relatively in line with the Fed, to have at least 4 rate hikes in 2022 in addition to beginning the gradual reduction of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. It is important to remember that even with the Fed speeding up their tapering program and rate hikes starting, absolute rates will remain below historic average levels and are simply normalizing from emergency settings. Positioning for Rising Rates The Fed pivot facilitated major moves in the rates markets that could be expected coming out of a period of extremely accommodative central bank monetary policy. Similar to other periods of change, we believe clients are best served by re-evaluating the options to manage their cash more efficiently. This can often be achieved by synching investment objectives, risk parameters, and time horizon with the investments themselves. Taking a step back, it is important to spend a moment talking about investor psychology when interest rates are increasing. As we head into another rate hiking cycle, we understand that many investors will likely shift their focus to shorter duration strategies. While this type of tilt may favor MMFs and bank deposits, we often need to remind investors that what is important is to ensure cash and liquid assets are managed in an efficient manner, something that can lead to maximizing income and total return. As rates rise, duration can still be your friend but only if what happens with future interest rates is less than what is currently priced into the market. A robust investment and risk management process can mitigate interest rate risk while meeting the overriding objectives of capital preservation and liquidity. This is highlighted by our approach to portfolio positioning in the Summer of 2021 when yields were at their lows and spreads were at their tightest levels. We responded to these market dynamics accordingly, with high levels of liquidity and short duration profiles until the market appropriately priced in rising rates. The changes in market expectations and year-end technicals caused credit spreads to widen, and we were well-positioned to deploy cash given our short duration profiles. Today we currently favor short-term fixed rate and longer floating-rate securities in our portfolios. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Number of Rate Hikes Priced Into the Market \uf065 Forecasts/estimates are based on current market conditions, subject to change, and may not necessarily come to pass. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Number of Rate Hikes Priced Into the Market Forecasts/estimates are based on current market conditions, subject to change, and may not necessarily come to pass. Key Investment Themes Major changes are also in store for MMFs in 2022 as regulators worldwide attempt to improve the resiliency of prime funds, especially in times of market stress like we experienced in March 2020. In December, the SEC released the following policy recommendations: Minimum daily liquid asset requirements increased from 10% to 25%; weekly from 30% to 50% A removal of required and permissive liquidity fees and redemption gate provisions A swing pricing requirement for institutional prime and institutional tax-exempt money funds Amendments added to address the functioning of Government constant NAV MMFs should short-term interest rate policy ever be set at negative levels The proposals are subject to a 60 day public comment period. While the industry is heartened to see the elimination of the current gates and fees regime, it is likely to use the comment period to push back hard on the mandatory swing pricing requirement. As proposed, swing pricing will likely alter prime funds in a manner that makes them somewhat unrecognizable and removes much of the utility valued by investors. Tracking the impending regulatory developments and planning for alternatives to prime funds is certain to take on more importance as we move through 2022. The elements of societal change that Dylan expressed in the song and the need to heed the call also have parallels today as sustainable and socially responsible investing play an increasingly important role in treasury management. Whether investing to generate social change or to focus on strategies investing in companies making a more positive impact on environmental, social, and governance factors, treasury teams are looking to align their strategies with the broader corporate ethos. As a result, investors will look to their asset management partners to deliver new solutions that have a more direct and measurable diversity and inclusion impacts. Adapting and adjusting to change brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and the transition to work from home arrangements have also prompted a review of treasury systems and processes to ensure that they meet the continuous changes taking place today. Outdated and inefficient processes are being enhanced or replaced with tools including cloud-based solutions, APIs, and artificial intelligence providing assistance in cash flow forecasting, decision making, and developing more optimal cash management strategies. The inevitability of change will continue to drive innovation and advancements in technology, leading to opportunities for improved cash flow forecasting and visibility, optimal cash management, and more positive economics. There are also new opportunities to use investable cash balances to offset the cost of certain treasury tools and technology. In Summary \u201cThe line is drawn, as the present now, will later be past, for the times they are a-changin\u2019.\u201d The last stanza of Dylan\u2019s song speaks to change, the continual nature of change and the need for preparation. Tapering is winding down and rate increases are on the horizon. Regulators are likely to change the rules in the money market space and cash managers are looking for increased efficiency in managing their assets. Investors will likely continue to focus on ways to make an impact with their capital that are aligned with their values. While 2022 is shaping up to be a watershed year, also know that \u201cpresent will soon be the past\u201d. As always, we at Morgan Stanley are here to help and work with you to manage and adjust to the times that are a-changin\u2019. \u00d7 Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in these portfolios. Please be aware that these portfolios may be subject to certain additional risks and general market liquidity (market risk). Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. ESG Strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 Jonas Kolk Chief Investment Officer of Global Liquidity Global Liquidity Team Brian Buck Executive Director Robert Leggett Executive Director", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/the-times-the-are-a-changin.html"}
{"content": "While co-investing has been a feature of the private equity industry for many years, it is a more recent and growing trend in the hedge fund industry. We believe that hedge fund co-investments are an important tool to increase the total return of portfolios, while limiting correlation to traditional asset classes and core hedge fund strategies. Co- investments can also be used to respond more rapidly to dislocations in markets. \u00d7 Why are we seeing growth in hedge fund co-investment opportunities? Prior to the global financial crisis the hedge fund industry experienced strong inflows. Many hedge funds enjoyed relative freedom to pursue niche opportunities and put less liquid investments into side pockets. In recent years, industry inflows have been more limited and investors have been more restrictive on permissible investments, particularly less liquid situations. \u00d7 \uf065 Source: HFR\u00ae Global Hedge Fund Industry Report \u2013 Fourth Quarter 2021 as of January 2022 \u00d7 Source: HFR\u00ae Global Hedge Fund Industry Report \u2013 Fourth Quarter 2021 as of January 2022 As a result, hedge funds have had less discretionary capital available to deploy. This has coincided with regulatory changes that have decreased bank and insurance company willingness to invest in non-traditional asset classes, creating more opportunity for alternative forms of capital to fill that void. The end result has been an increase in hedge funds seeking co-investment capital for discrete opportunities that do not meet the liquidity, concentration or asset class guidelines of their main funds. From the investor\u2019s perspective, returns, fees, transparency and correlation are key focal points when it comes to hedge fund allocations. In our view, co- investments have the potential to provide improvement on all three fronts. In short, we believe co-investments offer a clear and self-sustaining value proposition to hedge fund managers and investors. For managers, co-investments represent a new form of capital that enables them to participate in high-conviction opportunities that, absent co-investment capital, they would not be able to pursue. For investors, co-investments offer a means of direct access to differentiated sources of return with potentially bespoke risk/return profiles as well as attractive fees, transparency and control rights. How do hedge fund co-investments differ from private equity co-investments? The primary difference is the universe of managers from which co-investments are sourced. Co-investing is a mature concept for private equity firms. Indeed, many private equity managers have established and often contractual processes for how co-investments are allocated among existing clients. Co-investing is a newer concept for hedge funds. Most hedge fund managers do not have a long list of existing investors with whom they have traditionally partnered on such investment opportunities. At the same time, most hedge fund allocators are not equipped to make decisions about co-investments. As a result, these opportunities tend not to be as heavily trafficked as private equity co-investments and there tends to be greater potential for tailoring implementation strategies. Another important difference is the breadth of asset classes accessible through each of the two categories. Private equity co-investments typically involve control private equity positions that are subject to the same factors that influence valuation of public equities. Hedge fund co-investments represent a diverse array of asset classes, liquidity profiles and risk. They can be \u201crisk-on\u201d or \u201crisk-off\u201d and everything in between. They can range from publicly traded equity and debt to non-traded investments, such as litigation finance and reinsurance, which have no correlation to traditional assets classes. For this reason, we would generally expect that hedge fund co-investments would have lower correlation to global equities than private equity co- investments. Hedge fund co-investments also tend to have shorter holding periods than private equity co-investments. How are hedge fund co-investments sourced? Today, sourcing is entirely dependent upon having access to a robust network of idea-generators. The most obvious sourcing channel comes from hedge fund managers with whom an investor has existing primary fund investments. However, it is increasingly common for hedge fund managers to solicit co-investment capital directly from allocators with whom no primary fund relationship exists. This is happening because few hedge fund managers have existing investors with active co-investment programs and managers recognize co-investments as an opportunity to broaden their client base and support future business growth. There is also a growing trend toward fundless sponsors or emerging hedge funds offering co-investments in order to establish investor confidence. What are the key barriers to entry? While we believe there are many potential benefits to making co- investments, there are challenges as well. Broadly speaking, we see four key barriers to entry: SOURCING: Having a wide network of existing hedge funds\u2014idea generators\u2014 and a pipeline for new ones is critical. The greatest advantage in this space comes from the luxury of choice, having access to a wide range of potential opportunities and being selective. ANALYSIS: Co-investing requires integrating a hedge fund manager due diligence framework with asset- specific underwriting. Many hedge fund investors are not structured or resourced to support this two- pronged approach. EXECUTION: Co-investing requires efficient decision making, often over the course of mere days. In addition, legal documentation and vehicle structuring must be accomplished far more rapidly than is required in traditional fund investing. CAPITAL FLEXIBILITY: Co-investments are often presented because the hedge fund manager has constraints on size and/or liquidity that prevent inclusion of these ideas in a main fund. Investors must have the mandate and appetite to be flexible around these parameters in order to maximize their opportunity set. How is alignment typically achieved with the hedge fund manager? Generally speaking, alignment is achieved in two ways. It can come from assurance that a manager has \u201cskin in the game\u201d, investing personal capital alongside that of external investors. And it can come through fee structures that are akin to \u201csweat equity\u201d. There are a wide range of fee structures (including no fees), but structures are typically skewed toward realization-based incentives over a performance hurdle whereby a manager is only compensated if the investment achieves the investor\u2019s objectives. What is the role of co-investments in client portfolios? What are the trade-offs? We believe the primary role of hedge fund co-investments in client portfolios is to potentially increase expected return. Secondary benefits may include improving transparency, reducing average fees and introducing targeted exposures that are not correlated to existing allocations. The trade-offs are that co-investments are resource-intensive and require quick response times. In addition, they can have higher risk and wider distributions of outcomes than traditional fund investments. Finally, co-investments may require more onerous contractual liquidity. Conclusion In our view, hedge fund co-investments have a distinct role to play in well-balanced portfolios, offering important diversification benefits to traditional asset classes as well as hedge funds and opportunistic investments. We believe that hedge fund co-investing will reach the level of adoption currently found in private equity, leaving significant runway for growth in the years ahead. \u00d7 Jarrod Quigley Managing Director AIP Hedge Fund Solutions", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/the-rise-of-hedge-fund-co-investments.html"}
{"content": "Summary In the second paper of our decarbonisation series, we focus on what the UN Principles for Responsible Investing (UN PRI) refer to as the \u2018inevitable policy response\u2019 to global warming and ask: why does this matter for investors? \u00d7 AT A GLANCE Stronger government decarbonisation policies are critical to reaching net zero by 2050. Technology alone is not enough. Rapid decarbonisation does not have to be a material net negative to the world economy or living standards, although there are likely to be pockets of disruption. There is increasing regulatory momentum, with rapid global adoption of net zero targets and carbon tariffs, and investors should be preparing for the implications now. High-quality, low-carbon portfolios are well positioned for the for the carbon transition given their low sensitivity to carbon taxes and green technological disruption. \u00d7 INTRODUCTION The challenges are immense\u2026 Although climate change concerns have surged, fuelled in part by the pandemic, the immediacy and severity of the threat to global ecosystems and economies is not broadly understood. The world is supposed to decarbonise by 2050 in order to keep global warming at 1.5 \u00b0C as laid out in the Paris Climate Agreement \u2013 but global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have not yet begun to structurally decline. On their own, new low-carbon technologies are not enough, given the enormous fossil fuel system we have built. Using BloombergNEF data, we estimate that, based on historic trends, it would take 50 to 80 years to decarbonise global electricity generation and even longer to electrify the total energy system \u2013 Display 1. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Reduction in carbon intensity of global power generation is very slow Global Carbon Intensity (MtCO2 /TWh) \uf065 Source: BloombergNEF, New Energy Outlook 2021 \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Reduction in carbon intensity of global power generation is very slow Global Carbon Intensity (MtCO2 /TWh) Source: BloombergNEF, New Energy Outlook 2021 \u2026but not insurmountable The key debate is whether governments can accelerate decarbonisation through radical policy mechanisms. Already, regulation has proven to be effective. European Union (EU) policies driving tougher environmental standards have helped to significantly reduce emissions over the past 15 years, even as global CO2 levels have risen \u2013 Display 2. Elsewhere, momentum is positive, with countries accounting for roughly 90% of global emissions having now set net-zero targets (as at 23 December 2021)1 \u2013 including a recent announcement from India at the UN Climate Change Conference, COP26. We expect these will start to trickle down into real economic policies over time. The pathway to success involves governments creating climate change policies with increased impact and scope, as well as greater global coordination. This does not have to be a significant net cost to the economy or a structural negative for living standards. Carbon taxes can be redistributed through green dividends or zero-sum emission trading schemes, and the building out of green infrastructure can serve as a net fiscal stimulus and a net job creator. Inevitably, certain sectors will be disrupted (e.g. coal production and power generation, oil industries, aviation etc.), but others are likely to benefit (e.g. renewable energy, electric vehicles, greener utilities etc.). GOVERNMENT POLICY TOOLS In our view, policymaking can and must play a crucial role in global decarbonisation. We advocate a combination of measures: both the \u2018sticks\u2019 to penalise and the \u2018carrots\u2019 to encourage. \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: Supportive EU policies helped to reduce emissions even as global levels rose \uf065 Source: Crippa, M., Guizzardi, D., Muntean, M., Schaaf, E., Solazzo, E., Monforti-Ferrario, F., Olivier, J.G.J., Vignati, E., Fossil CO2 emissions of all world countries - 2020 Report, EUR 30358 EN, Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg, 2020, ISBN 978-92-76-21515-8, doi:10.2760/143674, JRC121460.

This does not have to be a significant net cost to the economy or a structural negative for living standards. The Sticks Raising carbon prices and taxes is the most common and obvious policy tool, given higher carbon prices will encourage both companies and consumers to switch to low-carbon alternatives faster. There are over 50 different country-level carbon pricing schemes in operation, however these cover only 20% of global emissions, and the consensus is that prices have not been high enough. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is the most established scheme, essentially operating on a \u201ccap and trade\u201d principle whereby dirtier companies buy credits in the market from cleaner companies to meet the cap on emissions. It is currently being expanded with more sectors and activities bring brought into scope. Several other countries are also considering carbon price schemes. Carbon border tariffs or \u201cgreen border\u201d taxes level the playing field for domestic producers of globally traded commodities such as steel, aluminium and cement. In these cases, a domestic carbon tax can lead to \u201ccarbon leakage\u201d if buyers avoid paying the tax by importing commodities more cheaply from countries with no carbon taxes. The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the first of its kind, will be phased in from 2023 to 2026. Coal phaseout is critical to limiting climate change, given coal is the most carbon intensive fossil fuel and coal-fired power generation is the largest single source of all global CO2 emissions. However, this is easier for richer countries with ageing coal plants, growing renewables generation and relatively flat electricity demand. Although most EU countries have already mandated the phaseout of coal power generation, large coal consumers, e.g. India, China and Indonesia, while trying to contain coal, are still building coal plants to meet growing energy demand. Reducing fuel subsidies could be impactful. Global fuel subsidies were an estimated $180 billion in 20202, including consumer fuel subsidies in emerging markets. Many governments are reluctant to cut subsidies given their political sensitivity. However, if this changes, and they come up with a way to reduce subsidies or decouple them from fossil fuel use, this would have roughly the same effect as introducing a carbon tax system. Bans on Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicle (EV) targets are increasingly popular among green minded governments, and have already been announced in several countries \u2013 Display 3. In July 2021, the EU proposed a 100% reduction in new fleet emissions by 2035, effectively a comprehensive ban on ICE vehicles. This is a strong incentive for car companies to shift their sales rapidly to EVs. Some of the largest car markets also have EV targets for car manufacturers, e.g. the EU has progressive targets, and China has a manufacturer quota system whereby EVs must have at least a 25% share in light vehicle sales by 2025. The Carrots Green dividends are a mechanism to make carbon taxes more palatable by redistributing them to every voter as a \u201cgreen dividend\u201d. Consumers who switch to greener alternatives \u2013 for example, green electricity tariffs or buying electric vehicles (EVs) \u2013 become financial beneficiaries if the dividend they receive is greater than the carbon tax they pay. Such a scheme has been operating successfully in British Columbia for a number of years now. \u00d7 DISPLAY 3: More than 20 countries have either electrification targets or ICE bans for cars 3,4,5 \uf065 Source: IEA (2021), Global EV Outlook 2021.

Green infrastructure stimulus provides government support for the massive increase in infrastructure investment that decarbonisation requires. Obvious targets include electricity grids, energy storage, EV charging points, rail networks and energy-efficient buildings. The EU Green Deal has pledged \u20ac1 trillion to help reach net zero by 2050, but estimates are the total climate and energy investment gap is \u20ac2.6trn over the next ten years, suggesting more investment will need to be generated. THE INVESTMENT IMPLICATIONS Though the exact implications for companies and investors may be hard to quantify, it is clear that carbon is rapidly becoming a key consideration in company analysis. Carbon pricing should reduce long-term demand in carbon-heavy industries such as coal and oil. Tougher carbon policies are also likely to upset the relative competitive landscape within some carbon-heavy sectors, as companies who have invested into cleaner technologies are likely to take market share at the expense of those who have not (e.g. in auto manufacturing). Furthermore, companies offering decarbonisation solutions and low-carbon alternatives in any sector may benefit from accelerating policy support at the expense of carbon laggards. And, as consumers become more aware of the impact of climate change, carbon will likely become a key driver of individuals\u2019 purchase decisions, meaning consumer brands with superior carbon profiles would be relative winners. \u00d7 \" While indications are the individual will be no worse off from more robust regulation, for corporates, there will be winners and losers and asset owners must have a process in place to help mitigate climate change risk in their portfolios. Bottom Line: Reducing Carbon Uncertainty One way to reduce \u201ccarbon uncertainty\u201d in a portfolio is to focus on companies that are high-quality compounders. These companies are typically naturally carbon-light, benefit from pricing power and resilient demand, and face lower carbon disruption risks than most other companies. For instance, the estimated impact of a $100 tax per tonne of CO2e on the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of companies held in our global portfolios is less than -1.5%, versus the MSCI World Index at up to -14% (for Scope 1 and 2 emissions) \u2013 Display 4. Therefore, we believe their compounding ability should be preserved even in an environment of rapidly tightening carbon policies. \u00d7 DISPLAY 4: Our portfolios should be better positioned to withstand decarbonisation disruption trendsCarbon Sensitivity of EBIT (5-yr avg) to $100/tCO2e price7 \uf065 Source: Morgan Stanley Investment Management, FactSet, Trucost.

Data as at 30 September 2021 for Strategy Representative Accounts. IN CONCLUSION Policy making can and must play a crucial role in global decarbonisation. To be effective, it must be more coordinated and the price of carbon necessarily higher. We advocate a combination of both stick and carrot measures. While indications are the individual will be no worse off from more robust regulation, for corporates, there will be winners and losers and asset owners must have a process in place to help mitigate climate change risk in their portfolios. A low carbon, high quality portfolio is one way to help position investors for what\u2019s to come. \u00d7 1 https://climateactiontracker.org/climate-target-update-tracker/ 2 Source: IEA Energy Subsidy data (2021). 3 Please note that this list is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not fully representative of all countries with electrification targets or ICE vehicle bans. 4 Targets as of 20 April 2021. 5 Electrified vehicles include battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), depending on the definitions of each country. 6 ZEV = zero-emission vehicle (BEVs, PHEVs and FCEVs). 7 The $100 tax/per tonne of CO2e scenarios for the MSCI indices are illustrative estimates.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy\u2019s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 Vladimir Demine Head of ESG Research International Equity Team Candida de Sliva Executive Director International Equity Team Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I Previous Next Download the original research paper Decarbonisation: the Inevitable Policy Response - Long Version 10/26/2021", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/decarbonisation-the-inevitable-policy-response.html"}

{"content": "The pandemic accelerated key secular trends that have been underway for decades, disrupting global real estate in a multitude of ways. Continued economic expansion and transformative secular trends support upside for real estate securities in the year ahead. Significant dispersions remain, representing opportunities for active managers focused on the nuances of industry sectors, regions, countries and individual securities. \u00d7 Introduction The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated disruption in virtually every corner of the global economy\u2014 and global real estate is no different. What has traditionally been a slower-moving sector, driven primarily by demographics and local economics, now sits at the epicenter of profound changes in how people live, work, shop and communicate. Real estate markets are in transition. Yet, favorable global growth coupled with significant secular trends provide active managers with ample opportunity to add value in 2022. We anticipate another strong year for global real estate securities, with cash flow growth and dividends likely to sustain above-trend levels, with our forecasts estimating greater than 10% growth. To understand how we\u2019re positioning our portfolios for the future, let\u2019s start by reviewing how Global Listed Real Estate performed during 2021. 2021 Listed Real Estate Market Recap Global listed real estate markets performed well in 2021, returning +27.2% in USD for full year 2021, as measured by the FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index. This growth was supported by several macro and fundamental factors, including monetary and fiscal stimulus, continued vaccine distribution, and the reopening\u2014or anticipated reopening\u2014 of economies around the world. North America led the pack with strength in U.S. self-storage (+79.4%), industrial/logistics (+62.6%), residential (+57.9%) and retail (+52.1%), each of which outperformed the index. Both Europe and Asia lagged North America, in large part due to Covid-19 resurgences and/or zero-Covid policy stances that curtailed full reopenings. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index USD Returns \uf065 Source: FTSE EPRA Nareit, Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

Meanwhile, real estate operating fundamentals will continue to benefit from strong gross domestic product (GDP) growth, very limited new supply additions, strong credit availability and a wall of capital seeking investment in real estate. Here\u2019s a closer look at the macroeconomic conditions that support our view for a strong year ahead for global real estate securities. \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: Global GDP Strong and Above Trend, Albeit a Deceleration from Prior Year \uf065 Source: Morgan Stanley Research, data as of November 14, 2021.

Forward-looking statements are by their nature inherently uncertain insofar as actual realized returns or other projected results can change quickly based on, among other things, unexpected market movements, changes in interest rates, legislative or regulatory developments, acts of God, and other developments. INFLATION REMAINS ABOVE TREND The economics team at Morgan Stanley Research forecasts that inflation in major markets will \u201cpeak then retreat\u201d by more than two percentage points throughout 2022 while remaining above-trend level. Historically, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) have posted positive returns in most rising inflation periods. This is because inflation is typically concurrent with stronger economic growth\u2014and investors consider real estate an inflation hedge. As prices rise, property values tend to appreciate, while cash flow streams also benefit. The extent to which landlords can pass through price increases depends on lease terms. Short-term leases, such as for hotels, self-storage and residential, are reset frequently and landlords have the ability to adjust rents in reaction to inflationary pressures. Longer duration leases, such as for retail, office and industrial space, often offer inflation protection through fixed rental rate bumps or Consumer Price Index (CPI) linked increases. In light of forecasted above-trend inflation and strong anticipated GDP growth, our team expects real estate cash flows to benefit. Based on expectations for strong cash-flow growth, our team is forecasting 10% year-over-year dividend growth for 2022. \u00d7 DISPLAY 3: REITs May Offer Inflation Hedge \uf065 Sources: Bloomberg Economic Data, Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

WAGES CONTINUE UPWARD TRAJECTORY Continued economic recovery coupled with labor shortages is driving wages higher. Rising wages fuel consumer strength and spending, which is a positive for many real estate sectors. That said, investors need to weigh these benefits against the impact of higher wages and limited labor availability on everything from construction costs to operations. We think labor shortages will ease as workforce participation increases on the margin, but caution that landlords with more operationally intense cost structures will see outsized expense growth versus their peers. This underscores the importance of technology adoption in 2022. \u00d7 DISPLAY 4: Wage Growth Versus Inflation \uf065 Source: Bloomberg Economic Data: Wage Growth based on WGTROVER Index; measure of nominal wage growth of individuals based on median percent change in the hourly wage of individuals 12 months apart; collected by the Atlanta Fed, https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker.aspx Inflation data based on CPI YoY Index, measure of prices paid by consumers for a market basket of consumer goods &amp; services; collected by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u00d7 DISPLAY 4: Wage Growth Versus Inflation Source: Bloomberg Economic Data: Wage Growth based on WGTROVER Index; measure of nominal wage growth of individuals based on median percent change in the hourly wage of individuals 12 months apart; collected by the Atlanta Fed, https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker.aspx Inflation data based on CPI YoY Index, measure of prices paid by consumers for a market basket of consumer goods &amp; services; collected by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. RATES REMAIN LOWER FOR LONGER Strong global economic growth suggests that central banks and governments will begin removing monetary and fiscal support. The Federal Reserve (the \u201cFed\u201d) has begun tapering its bond purchases and is likely to announce nominal rate hikes in 2022, with most central banks around the globe expected to follow the Fed\u2019s lead. While the conventional wisdom is that rising interest rates are bad news for real estate, history has shown that rising interest rates\u2014when accompanied by strong GDP growth\u2014create a favorable backdrop for real estate and real estate securities. This is because, unlike fixed income and many other yield-producing assets, real estate retains economic sensitivity and pricing power. Moreover, our outlook for rates to remain lower for longer has not changed. Low absolute interest rates continue to add fuel to investors\u2019 search for yield\u2014and as of December 2021, according to Preqin, $376.3 billion of undeployed capital is sitting on the sidelines and ready to be invested in real estate. \u00d7 DISPLAY 5: REIT Returns and Change in Interest Rates \uf065 Source: Nareit analysis of FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs Index via FactSet, 10 Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate via FRED from Q1 1993 through Q3 2021.

Five Top Trends for Real Estate and REITs to Watch in 2022 Favorable economic growth conditions bode well for real estate securities. While this has typically been the case, the investment outlook in the year ahead is far more nuanced. The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated and introduced new market dynamics, creating significant and, in many cases, surprising dispersions\u2014and opportunities\u2014within sectors and regions. #1 COVID BEHAVIORS MORPH INTO LEARNED \u201cNEW NORMAL\u201d EXPECTATIONS, IMPACTING OFFICE AND BUSINESS HOTELS More than two decades ago, the arrival of \u201cdot coms\u201d set in motion profound changes that have touched every industry, including real estate. Demand shifted from retail centers to warehouses and data centers, while more flexible work arrangements changed the dynamic for office space. Then Covid-19 accelerated all of these trends, prompting a dramatic\u2014and in many cases permanent\u2014shift in consumer, employee and organizational behaviors and norms. Now that hybrid and remote work is part of the lexicon and no longer an exception, real estate is undergoing a permanent shift. Office property in many cities and business-focused hospitality continue to suffer impaired demand and values. However, the actual impact on office demand will vary by city and an increased focus on health, wellness and safety could serve as a partial offset to demand impairment; a nuanced approach to top-down trend analysis will be necessary for active managers. Office utilizations globally recently ranged from approximately 15% to upwards of 70%, with some of the lowest utilization in San Francisco, Seattle and New York, and some of the highest in Stockholm, Paris and Hong Kong. Similarly, essential business travel will return, but likely not to pre-pandemic levels, as corporations appreciate the cost efficiency of virtual environments. That said, leisure travel has, in many places, recovered to 2019 levels. We\u2019re also seeing notable regional differences, based in part on vaccination rates and local travel mandates. #2 BRICK AND MORTAR STOREFRONTS CONTINUE TO REASSERT IMPORTANCE IN DISTRIBUTION AFTER ALMOST A DECADE OF DECLINES Retail has experienced a significant secular decline as e-commerce has shifted demand from storefronts to warehouses, data centers and logistics. Here too, there has been a disconnect between the growth of overall retail sales and demand for retail property. However, there now is a renewed appreciation for the storefront as retailers rethink the role of the physical storefront in distribution and, in some cases, brand development. There will likely continue to be square footage rationalization as e-commerce grows, but brick-and-mortar retail isn\u2019t going to zero. The pandemic has underscored the importance of a physical location in a true omnichannel distribution environment. Consequently, retailers are reinvesting in their stores and looking to sign leases in premium retail centers globally. Improving retail fundamentals also bode well for this sector. Supply chain issues are on track to resolve in 2022, leading to inventory restocking and increased spending for items with pent-up demand. Consumer spending is expected to remain strong in 2022\u2014supported by rising wages, higher personal income and robust savings levels. Likewise, retailer bankruptcies are projected to be very low in 2022, given improved tenant credit and prior year fall-out. \u00d7 DISPLAY 6 U.S. Retailer Bankruptcies 2017 - 2021 \uf065 Source: Citi Research, data as of December 8, 2021.

While technology has shifted real estate demand from physical retail or office space to data centers, cell towers and logistics facilities, it will create winners and losers in real estate. Landlords are now adopting \u201cprop-tech\u201d to improve everything from sales and marketing, to back-office functions, and building management. For example, in residential property, such features as smart locks, self-guided tours and online lease applications are selling points for many prospective tenants, who have grown more comfortable with a wide variety of technological applications in day-to-day life. This is particularly important today, and we believe that early adopters of technology will be better insulated from expense pressures driven by higher wages and labor shortages. Given that real estate has one of the lowest technology adoption rates among global industry categories, real estate companies and investors have a significant runway to reap the benefits of increased integration. \u00d7 DISPLAY 7: Percentage of Companies That Have Adopted a Tool by Category \uf065 Source: Ernst and Young LLP Real Estate Owners Survey, data as of March 2020.

According to the United Nations Environment Program, building operations and construction represent 39% of global greenhouse gas emissions. It estimates that direct building carbon emissions will need to be cut by half by 2030 to get on track for 2050. At the same time demand for green building features and energy metering is growing, tenants are also prioritizing health, safety and wellness. We believe this will lead to a new capital expenditure cycle for commercial real estate. Those landlords that have already focused on energy efficiency, best-in-class air filtration, and water and waste reductions are best positioned to navigate these increasing costs going forward, as significant investment will have already taken place. While the growing focus on sustainability is a global trend, it is important to note that there are regional differences due to existing norms and new or expected regulations that mandate energy efficiency. \u00d7 DISPLAY 8: Annual Global CO2 Emissions \uf065 Share of buildings and construction energy and emissions, 2017 Source: Global Alliance for Building and Construction, 2018 Global Status Report. \u00d7 DISPLAY 8: Annual Global CO2 Emissions Share of buildings and construction energy and emissions, 2017 Source: Global Alliance for Building and Construction, 2018 Global Status Report. #5 TRANSACTION ACTIVITY INCREASES ALONGSIDE RECOVERING FUNDAMENTALS - MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS (M&amp;A) EXCEEDS 2021 LEVELS With absolute interest rates likely to stay lower for longer, the search for yield is and remains intense. Among the universe of investable asset classes, real estate offers some of the highest yields, second only to global high-yield bonds. Further, private funds have raised significant capital to deploy earmarked for global real estate. We expect that bid/ask spreads will narrow further as renewed GDP growth, successful vaccine dissemination and the re-opening of economies create more clarity on the cadence of cash flow recovery and real estate values. As fundamentals improve, transaction activity should increase. All told, we believe that M&amp;A activity and privatizations in 2022 will exceed levels in 2021, which saw a wave of transactions. \u00d7 DISPLAY 9: Yield of Investable Alternatives \uf065 Source: FactSet for Equity Index Dividend Yield; BlackRock Aladdin for Fixed Income Index Nominal Yield; FactSet EcoWin database for 10 Year U.S. Treasury Yield.

Meanwhile, significant inner-sector dispersion\u2014particularly for securities tied to retail, office and hospitality\u2014provides opportunities for active stock pickers. While we\u2019re positive on global real estate overall, we think key trends in 2022 will provide additional tailwinds for select sectors and companies. \u00d7 DISPLAY 12: 2022 Sector Scorecard \uf065 Source: Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

Global Listed Real Assets Team: Investment Philosophy The identification of relative value is at the forefront of real estate investing at Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM). MSIM\u2019s Global Listed Real Assets team uses proprietary research to invest in publicly traded real estate securities that we believe offer the best value relative to their underlying assets and growth prospects. The team combines a bottom-up approach, assessing the intrinsic value, equity multiples and growth prospects of each security, with a top-down view that incorporates fundamental inflection points, macroeconomic considerations, and geopolitical and country risk. By incorporating both an equity market valuation and a more traditional real estate valuation with a top-down overlay, we believe our strategies are well prepared to identify securities with the best expected total returns. \u00d7 Risk Considerations Investing entails risks and there can be no assurance that any strategy will achieve profits or avoid incurring losses. Asset Allocation/Diversification does not protect you against a loss in a particular market; however it allows you to spread that risk across various asset classes. There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, investors can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Stocks of small- and medium-capitalization companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. Real estate investments, including real estate investment trusts (REITs), are subject to risks similar to those associated with the direct ownership of real estate and they are sensitive to such factors as management skills and changes in tax laws. The risks of owning real estate directly as well as the way Real Estate Operating Companies (REOCs) are organized and operated will affect the Portfolio. They require specialized management skills, causing a Portfolio to indirectly bear the costs of such skills. In addition, foreign real estate companies may be subject to the laws, rules and regulations governing those entities and their failure to comply with those laws, rules and regulations could negatively impact the performance of those entities. \u00d7 Laurel Durkay Head of Global Listed Real Assets Global Listed Real Assets Team", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/top-trends-for-real-estate-and-reits-in-2022-and-beyond.html"}
{"content": "2021 ended with the re-introduction of restrictions to deal with the new Omicron variant of COVID-19 and it is not clear whether 2022 will see companies muddling through or rising to the challenge of delivering better outcomes. Read more Hear more from the International Equity Team\u2019s Head of Sustainable Outcomes, Marte Borhaug. \u00d7 What is a better outcome? As long-term investors we seek to deliver better outcomes for our clients through producing attractive returns. In order to do that we must invest with a conscious eye on whether companies can deliver better outcomes not just today but 5, 10 and even 20 years from now. We back companies that have the characteristics needed to lead in the long run, like recurring revenue, pricing power and strong management, and importantly also have the awareness to invest in managing and improving their ESG impact. This logic is consistent with how humans have evolved. If we are to believe the latest neuroscience,1 humans inherently seek \u2018better outcomes\u2019 and, perhaps contrary to common belief, it is not the achievement that gives us satisfaction but the journey itself. We do this because a \u2018seeking system\u2019 gives us a feeling of reward and pleasure when we explore our surroundings and seek new information for survival. Similarly, companies seeking to deliver better outcomes and faced with a changing world must explore their surroundings and seek new information for survival. Looking back on 2021, they had plenty of change to manoeuvre. Instead of a pure \u2018return to normal\u2019, 2021 has been a year of continued headwinds. Although we saw signs of a bounce back as COVID-19 lockdown measures lifted in the spring plus sharp earnings growth, a number of economic challenges have lingered: from supply chain disruption and labour shortages to intensified China-US trade and political tensions. Despite these issues, equity markets continued to boom, buoyed by positive vaccine rollout news, with growth stocks and more cyclical value stocks taking turns to drive the market forward, seemingly unphased by peak earnings and peak margins or persistent inflation taking hold. The dangers of earnings and multiple correction grew larger, but seemed always just beyond the horizon. Investors started the year leaning into the cyclical rally but ended the year looking for more defensive positioning, which may bode well for quality investors. We also saw ESG momentum continue to build in 2021, with USD $139.2 billion2 of flows globally going into ESG funds. In Europe, the most mature sustainable investment market, this shift to ESG funds has been via active management. This is not a surprise. It\u2019s hard to remain passive in the face of challenges like climate change; if you believe the world is going to change significantly as sustainability externalities start to be \u2018priced in\u2019, there will be winners and losers creating investment risks and opportunities. Being on the right side of that change is key. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Global sustainable fund flows Q4 2018 - Q3 2021 \uf065 Source: Morningstar, 31 December 2021 \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Global sustainable fund flows Q4 2018 - Q3 2021 Source: Morningstar, 31 December 2021 Sustainable fund flows Q4 2018 - Q3 2021, Europe and US \uf065 Source: Morningstar, 31 December 2021 \u00d7 Sustainable fund flows Q4 2018 - Q3 2021, Europe and US Source: Morningstar, 31 December 2021 Underlying the shift towards ESG is evidence that more and more countries are taking steps to create a more sustainable society and economy. Most of the actions in 2021 were linked to COP26 (the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference) that took place in Glasgow in November. The pressing urgency of the climate challenge brought a series of new commitments to tighten carbon targets, phase \u2018down\u2019 coal, removal of fossil fuel subsidies, tackle methane emissions and stop deforestation. Countries representing 70% of global emissions and GDP have now committed to reaching net zero by 2050 or 2060, with massive implications for many corporates\u2014 Display 2. Regulators acted too\u2014and some have come a long way. In Europe new sustainable investments3 that aim to give clients more transparency around sustainable investment came into force and the European Central Bank presented an action plan to include climate change considerations in its monetary policy strategy.4 In the US the SEC has moved from throwing out investor proposals pushing companies like Exxon on climate change in 2019, to forcing companies to hold investor votes on emission targets in 2021.5 Whether one believes the pace of change is too fast or too slow, the direction of change is clear. For the year ahead, the environment remains uncertain, whether one looks at it through the lens of economics, health, politics, or sustainability, but we believe there are three trends that will shape outcomes for companies, economies and societies. \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: Coverage of announced national net zero pledges \uf065 Source: International Energy Agency (2021), Net Zero by 2050, IEA, Paris \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: Coverage of announced national net zero pledges Source: International Energy Agency (2021), Net Zero by 2050, IEA, Paris First, after a pandemic that has so far seen 230 million cases and nearly 5 million deaths, we expect a stronger push on social challenges, from diversity to inequality, as economies get back on their feet. COVID-19 has not only hit companies and economies but has put the world back two decades in the fight against poverty, as vulnerable countries and groups of people have shouldered the brunt of the burden.6 The pressure on companies to play their part in tackling inequality is likely to continue, from eliminating race and gender inequities to protecting the human rights of workers in the supply chain. This year we already saw the introduction of Nasdaq\u2019s new rules7 requiring firms to disclose board-level diversity statistics and have, or explain why they do not have, at least two diverse directors. Similar diversity measures were also announced by the Hong Kong stock exchange, making it clear that \u2018a single gender board is not considered to be a diverse board\u2019 and calling on companies to appoint a director of a different gender. We are also seeing increased action from policy-makers and investors. On human rights, the EU is considering rules to make human rights due diligence mandatory while the global responsible investor organisation the UNPRI has announced a new global collaborative platform to support investors in taking action on social issues.8 Together these pressures are likely to lead to greater action on the S in ESG. Second, work will turn from climate commitments to policy reality\u2014and so watch out for more laws, fiscal incentives, investor pressure as well a continuation of rising climate litigations as the transition to low carbon continues. This will not only impact the fossil fuel industry. For example, the car industry\u2014whether it\u2019s proposals to effectively ban new fossil fuel cars from as early as 2035 like the EU or suggesting new incentives for electric vehicles like the US, the economic rules of the game are changing. Every sector will need to change and companies who want to stay ahead will need to adapt now or risk ending up in the company graveyard. Third, next year could prove to be the year of \u2018nature\u2019 as countries meet for the much less talked about COP15 (the 15th United Nation conference on biodiversity) to address the depletion of planetary resources.9 Targets will be set in Kunming in China for the next decade and commitments from both governments and the private sector have already emerged. A coalition of more than 50 countries has committed to protect almost a third of the planet by 2030.10 We\u2019re also seeing the emergence of voluntary disclosure frameworks for companies (Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures \u2013 TNFD) and investors promising to eliminate agricultural commodity-driven deforestation risks across their investment portfolios and invest in nature-based solutions. Although new targets are unlikely to lead to an immediate price on free resources such as water, air, forests, and the ocean, it should speed up government action, business decisions and investment allocations. Companies looking to future proof their business will need to understand how dependent they are on planetary resources and how they are impacting nature through their products and services to take action to manage the risks and explore opportunities. Whatever the pace of change in 2022, efforts to create a sustainable future is a game that\u2019s played out in decades, not months. Just like any journey, there will be bumps in the road but as the transition takes place, we believe companies with a strong \u2018seeking system\u2019 that helps them be alert to the world around them will help them stay on top of their game and deliver long-term returns for clients. As bottom-up stock pickers, and with my role as Head of Sustainable Outcomes for the International Equity team, we\u2019re determined to keep seeking better outcomes, to learn and improve our offering to you and to keep pressing for progress from the world\u2019s best companies. \u00d7 1 https://qz.com/684940/neuroscience-confirms-that-to-be-truly-happy-you-will-always-need-something-more/ 2 Source: Morningstar, Global Combined Sustainable Flow Data Q3 2021. 3 A legislative package that is part of the EU\u2019s sustainable finance action plan, including SFDR and changes to MiFID II and UCITS. 4 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2021/html/ecb.pr210708_1~f104919225.en.html 5 https://www.ft.com/content/50b52600-dd43-427c-88a6-149cf790cb70 6 https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/12/1107752 7 https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/assets/Board%20Diversity%20Disclosure%20Five%20Things.pdf 8 https://www.unpri.org/investment-tools/stewardship/collaborative-stewardship-initiative-on-social-issues-and-human-rights 9 https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html 10 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/11/50-countries-commit-to-protection-of-30-of-earths-land-and-oceans \u00d7 Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy\u2019s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 Marte Borhaug Head of Sustainable Outcomes International Equity Team Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Previous Next Featured Video The Search for Better Outcomes - Video Whether looked at through the lens of economics, health, politics or sustainability, what outcomes might we see in the year ahead?

In our view, the three most important factors to watch are liquidity, fundamentals and valuations. Our analysis of these factors, on balance, leads us to favor a moderately under-risked tilt in our portfolios. Tapering and Tightening Taking each factor in turn, liquidity may loom largest in the minds of investors, given recent signs that global central banks are generally shifting toward a less accommodative monetary policy stance. In the near term, the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed), the most influential global central bank, will begin to taper the asset purchase program used to support markets during the pandemic. The Bank of England is a step ahead, having implemented their first rate hike in three years in December 2021. That the Fed did a poor job in effectively communicating the difference between tapering (not a direct form of tightening) and rate hikes (a direct form of tightening), has done little to quell market concerns about the move away from pandemic-era stimulus. With tapering, the authorities continue to purchase assets, albeit while gradually reducing the quantity. Interest rate hikes encourage saving and increase the cost of capital, slowing the pace of credit creation. \u00d7 Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Jeff Mueller Co-Director of High-Yield, Portfolio Manager - Eaton Vance Management \u00d7 Steve Concannon Co-Director of High-Yield, Portfolio Manager - Eaton Vance Management \u00d7 Featured Video High Yield Compared to other asset classes, high yield has proven resilient \u2014 even during bouts of volatility in recent years, says Co-Director of High Yield Jeff Mueller at Eaton Vance Management, and he anticipates further resilience in 2022 as long as the global economic recovery continues.", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/forging-opportunities-in-a-changing-high-yield-market.html"}

In thinking about the 2022 outlook for ESG, we believe carbon risk and human capital management are two areas that will have broad application and impact across industries and corporations \u2014 and garner the most regulatory attention. Across global capital markets in 2022, we expect regulators, corporations and investors to place greater emphasis on ESG factors in investment decision-making. Worldwide, we are in the early stages of building the necessary capital market infrastructure to fully price companies\u2019 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, people management impact, and board and employee diversity into security prices. However, the financial materiality of ESG factors is increasingly evident across multiple risk vectors, such as climate, inequality and competition for intellectual capital. ESG Data Reporting to Be Standardized Currently, investors receive information about companies\u2019 carbon exposure, human capital and diversity information from a range of nonstandardized sources, such as company websites, corporate social responsibility reports, sustainability reports, company regulatory filings or simple estimates. Government regulators around the world, however, have indicated they will begin \u2014 or advance \u2014 requirements for uniform disclosure standards around carbon, human capital and some diversity data. We expect ESG disclosure rules in major global markets, including the U.S., to have enough clarity to produce a meaningful impact on markets and security pricing in 2022. A new environment of higher-quality data may increase the need for expert ESG analysis to incorporate the information into prices of securities. \u00d7 Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } John Streur President and Chief Executive Officer - Calvert Calvert Research and Management 2022 Outlook: Responsible Investing - Video As we build the necessary capital market infrastructure to fully price ESG issues into security valuation, which we view as vital to supporting shareholder value, Calvert Research and Management CEO John Streur shares his outlook for 2022.", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/carbon-risk-human-capital-management-to-impact-security-prices-in-2022.html"}

While slower but ongoing recoveries in economic growth and global trade combined with reasonably attractive valuations for emerging-markets (EM) debt should act as tailwinds. That said, continued headwinds from higher inflation, tightening monetary conditions, developments in China and uncertainty linked to the evolution of COVID-19 will likely remain challenges. Ultimately, the broad and diverse nature of the EM universe means that these trends will play out differently at the individual country level. Global Growth Supportive Despite Vulnerabilities After a brisk expansion in global economic activity in 2021, growth is set to moderate to slightly less supportive levels this year. Global demand conditions remain relatively strong, with business activity still recovering from the pandemic-induced lockdowns. Less positively, however, the economic jolt of re-openings has been met by capacity constraints in developed and emerging economies, which is whipping up price pressures. In response, the world\u2019s central banks are gradually abandoning pandemic-era stimulus in a move to normalize monetary policy. The U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed), which has started tapering its asset purchases already, is expected to hike rates three times in 2022. Here, it is important to highlight that despite increases, rates will remain at extremely accommodative levels. Furthermore, with three hikes anticipated, it is unlikely that the Fed will surprise with more aggressive policy action, in our view. \u00d7 Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } John Baur Co-Director of Emerging Markets, Portfolio Manager - Eaton Vance Management \u00d7 Marshall Stocker Co-Director of Emerging Markets, Portfolio Manager - Eaton Vance Management \u00d7 Featured Video Emerging Markets According to Co-Director of Emerging Markets Marshall Stocker at Eaton Vance Management, markets have largely priced in the risks facing emerging markets debt, and valuations look much more compelling \u2014 allowing our diverse and global investment team to capitalize upon many unique and differentiated country opportunities.", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/unearthing-opportunities-in-an-altered-landscape.html"}
{"content": "As we enter 2022, we see labor market and inflation dynamics paving the way toward a tightening of monetary policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed). That said, we expect Fed tightening to proceed at a modest pace, as persistent supply-side price pressures related to COVID-19 complicate the inflation picture. Combined with mid-cycle growth rates, we believe these factors should result in moderate but positive equity returns in the coming year. Our preference is for quality stocks, and for developed over emerging markets equities. \u00d7 Inflation Dynamics Pose a Challenge for Fed Policy, Suggesting Caution in Hiking Pace The U.S. Labor Market Close to Fed\u2019s Definition of Healthy Lower participation rate: The labor force participation rate failed to recover fully in 2021, partially reflecting lingering effects from COVID-19 and unemployment support. While we expect these factors to dissipate gradually, it is likely that some workforce attrition will be permanent due to lifestyle changes and early retirements. From the Fed\u2019s perspective, the lower participation rate is less of an issue when compared to the aftermath of the global financial crisis (GFC). Unlike then, today the trend is not a response to depressed economic activity. With less competition for jobs, many workers (especially in the prime age band), are drawing on accumulated savings and taking more time to re-enter the labor force. Additionally, employed people are using tighter employment conditions to switch jobs for increased pay, as reflected in an observable trend in high resignation rates. Although the participation rate will likely recover in time, the prevailing labor-market conditions support workers\u2019 bargaining power and put upward pressure on wages. Robust and inclusive labor market recovery: Wage growth has been higher for lower income groups, who also benefitted from fiscal support offered post-pandemic. This dynamic helps to offset the regressive effects of higher prices and is in line with the Fed\u2019s new and broader definition of a healthy labor market. Given how lower-paid workers experienced downward mobility and rising indebtedness in the past decade, it is of little surprise that a strong bid for goods has emerged, as savings surged. \u00d7 Figure 1: Nominal Wage Growth Surging \uf065 Note: Figure shows the 12-month moving average of year-on-year median wage growth.

Hikes Pose a Unique Challenge for the Fed Rising wages and ultra-low mortgage rates have bolstered housing prices, contributing to above average rises in the shelter component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). From this perspective, the Fed should consider tapering more quickly and starting to hike rates, thereby lifting mortgage borrowing costs to temper housing-market demand. However, today\u2019s high inflation is not a one-sided story of demand. Supply-side issues persist, affecting prices for goods and foods. As energy prices normalize and supply-chain constraints ease into 2022, these price pressures should begin to abate. That said, statements from food companies indicate that food prices will remain elevated in 2022, while industry data from indicators such as the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index are ticking higher,1 suggesting that upward pressure on these CPI components has not yet peaked. Omicron-related disruptions, if prolonged, will only contribute to constrained supply, in our view. Importantly, Fed tapering and hikes are less effective in quelling supply-side inflationary pressures than those related to \u201coverheating\u201d demand. While hikes can spur U.S. dollar strength and lead to lower imported goods prices (partially offsetting supply-chain inflation), a stronger currency can also hurt the services sector. Furthermore, by boosting import demand, supply-chain bottlenecks in industries such as shipping could be exacerbated. Although these supply-side dynamics present challenges, we expect robust macroeconomic data will provide sufficient ammunition for a fairly steady pace of hikes in 2022 and 2023. Considering the very low starting point for Fed rates, this should alleviate concerns of economic overheating, while freeing up some space for monetary policy maneuverability in the future (a difficult undertaking at 0% rates). When it comes to the Fed\u2019s terminal rate, we remain slightly more optimistic than the market, as implied by current pricing, which reflects our expectations of growth remaining supportive. \u00d7 Figure 2: Implied Rate Levels by Hiking Path Scenario \uf065 Forecasts/estimates are based on current market conditions, subject to change, and may not necessarily come to pass.

Mid-Cycle Environment Favors Mildly Positive Equity Returns in 2022 Total Return Sensitivity Global equities should benefit from healthy global economic growth, which we expect to remain above potential in most regions in 2022. Expectations for high single-digit growth in earnings per share (EPS) remain below previous non-recession years, but still look sufficient to support positive total returns in equities. That said, high initial valuations (especially in the U.S.) remain a key risk, given the move towards a tighter monetary policy stance. For example, we calculate that a de-rating of 10% in price-to-earnings multiples would cancel out the high single-digit EPS growth in most countries (except China, where consensus EPS growth forecasts are higher). If the recent close relationship between U.S. inflation-adjusted yields and the 12-month forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple in the S&amp;P 500 holds, then every 10-basis point (bp) rise in 10-year U.S. real yields should lead to a 0.4x de-rating in the multiple. Thus, a 50bp rise in 10-year real yields would result in a roughly 10% de-rating in the multiple from current levels. With our current base-case outlook of 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rising toward 1.80%, primarily driven by real yields, we expect mid-single-digit returns for U.S. equities in 2022 \u2013 a level that is in line with other developed-markets regions. Investor Positioning Net inflows are unlikely to act as a tailwind for equity markets in 2022. Investors started 2021 with relatively light positioning, but increased exposure as fundamentals improved and equities rallied throughout the year. Recently, speculative investors appear to have added to their net long exposure to the S&amp;P 500 and positioning now appears somewhat stretched compared to recent history. At the same time, equity allocations by U.S. households have surpassed 40%, likely spurred along by the scarcity of other high-return alternatives to stocks. Notwithstanding these factors, we expect equity allocations to rise in 2022, as forecasts for modest tightening will sustain rates at historically low levels. Preference for Quality Fed hiking is likely to occur toward the mid-point of the business cycle in 2022. As shown in Figure 3, at this point in the cycle quality and growth companies appear better positioned than value and small caps, which are unable to benefit from their greater operating leverage. However, with elevated valuations increasing the vulnerability of growth stocks, quality appears to be the area with particular potential as we move into 2022. Notably, the susceptibility of the economy to external shocks increases with the length of the business cycle, and thus raises recession risks. In such a scenario, higher quality companies and certain equity markets (e.g., the U.S.) appear better placed to outperform than others (e.g., emerging markets and Europe). \u00d7 Figure 3: Growth and Quality Tend to Outperform as the Cycle Matures \uf065 The chart shows monthly excess return of the MSCI USA Value, Growth and Quality Indexes vs. the MSCI USA Index for the two ISM manufacturing index scenarios.

Elevated Valuations Given current valuation levels, the earning yields for equities still look attractive versus bonds. However, the comparative attractiveness could diminish as rates rise and fixed income becomes a more viable alternative again. Current valuation levels leave equities vulnerable to multiples compression (in part due to reduced liquidity injections in the market by central banks) and earnings shocks, given that growth is forecast to be slower in 2022. Bumpy Road to Recovery for Emerging Markets Inflation and Infection Rates Principal Challenges for Emerging Markets We expect emerging markets to face challenges in 2022, with consensus forecasts signaling weaker growth in China and the commodity-exporting economies. If commodity prices turn downward, emerging-markets equity indexes could be harshly penalized, as Latin America and EMEA2 have high weightings in commodity-related sectors within their respective MSCI regional indexes. Supply-chain disruptions and pent-up demand have caused a dramatic spike in commodity prices, especially in food prices for Latin America, where high inflation is expected to persist (Figure 4). Given the poor inflation outlook, we expect central banks to hike rates in both Latin America and Asia ex-China countries in the year ahead. The public health situation in emerging markets will be another key challenge, as the majority of the countries are still under-vaccinated and the new Omicron variant remains a key risk. Lastly, emerging markets had a robust rebound in current accounts and terms of trade driven by strong external demand in 2021. As external demand gradually softens in 2022, however, this tailwind could fade. And while the management of public finances remained relatively prudent throughout the pandemic, fiscal deficits widened and debt burdens still grew. As a result, emerging economies remain more exposed to rising rates. \u00d7 Figure 4: Inflation Upsurge Highest in Latin America \uf065 Inflation estimates for the years 2021-2023.

Investment Implications By taking an in-depth look across markets, we believe we can build better investment outcomes for clients. In doing so, we seek out opportunities that our research indicates will perform well at this point of the cycle, while avoiding those that will not. With an outlook of moderately strong growth, continued price pressures and monetary tightening ahead, we are maintaining a cautious and selective approach in 2022. Not surprisingly in an environment of rising rates, we remain underweight duration. Within equity markets, as we move towards the above-mentioned mid-cycle environment, we expect to move from the value space to quality, and favor developed over emerging markets. While valuations remain elevated, finding attractive entry points will be key for capturing value. \u00d7 Figure 5: Latest Tactical Views \uf065 This section is provided solely to demonstrate the Investment Team's views and type of analysis used in implementing their investment strategy.

APPENDIX: Asset Class Views in Detail Equities US Equities: Neutral Fundamentals\u2014Neutral: There is less risk that the U.S. will re-introduce COVID-19 related restrictions compared to Europe, supporting the outlook for relative economic, sales and EPS growth and reducing left-tail risks. EPS are expected to grow marginally quicker in the U.S. in 2021 compared to other developed market (DM) regions, but margins are already near record-highs, leaving less room for expansion, especially given higher costs from numerous drivers: Wages, energy, transportation costs, among others. Any meaningful rise in bond yields could hit the U.S. more profoundly due a high level of concentration in \u201chigh duration\u201d growth stocks, making the fundamental picture mixed. In our view, U.S. financial stocks are a good hedge in this risk scenario. Valuations\u2014Negative: U.S. equities did not de-rate meaningfully over 2021 and remain expensive compared to history. Relative to other DM equity markets, they have become even more expensive, as other regions experienced deeper de-ratings. Given the richness of U.S. Treasurys, the U.S. equity risk premium over bonds has not yet reached the lows of the previous cycle or the era before the global financial crisis (GFC). In our view, this factor is likely to help cushion any valuation de-rating, even under a base-case outlook of moderately higher yields, which should limit downside risk. Technicals &amp; Sentiment\u2014Neutral: Fund flows into U.S. equities were strong throughout 2021 and remained largely positive, even during episodes of volatility spikes. Survey sentiment has recently become bearish on the back of COVID-19 variant fears and the Fed\u2019s hawkish tilt. Other survey sentiment measures have also declined from the excessively bullish levels observed in September and early November 2021 and are currently in neutral territory. Eurozone Equities: Neutral Fundamentals\u2014Neutral: Following strong growth during most of the year, new headwinds have emerged for the region, including rising energy prices and decelerating global growth. In addition, Europe has been hit by a fourth COVID-19 wave, which preceded the Omicron variant and led to another round of social mobility restrictions across the region. We expect growth in the Eurozone to moderate to lower but positive levels, supported by sustained fiscal and monetary policy. Key political risks, such as the upcoming elections in Italy and France, represent potential sources of volatility in the coming year. Valuations\u2014Neutral: Absolute valuations are currently above long-term medians, despite de-rating recently and falling back toward the top end of the pre-pandemic range. In relative terms, Eurozone equities are trading at a historic low to the U.S., which also reflects the Value/Growth bias of the two regions. As we expect global interest rates to rise gradually and for growth in the U.S. to outperform the Eurozone, we do not expect the valuation discount between European and U.S. stocks to shrink dramatically in the short term. Technicals &amp; Sentiment\u2014Supportive*: After significant outflows in 2019 and 2020, flows have stabilized. However, positioning remains low as flows into European assets have been lagging global flows over the past year. U.K. Equities: Neutral Fundamentals\u2014Neutral: Soft data from the manufacturing and services sectors point toward continued strong demand in 2022. In absolute terms, earnings recovered in 2021 and are now likely to be a touch ahead of pre-pandemic levels. However, for the more globally focused FTSE 100 Index, which generates 70% of revenues outside of the U.K., we remain cautious. Stronger synchronized global growth and reduced COVID-19 infections across the world would cause us to reassess our view with a more positive outlook. Valuations\u2014Neutral: U.K. large-cap equities continue to screen as inexpensive relative to other DM equity indexes. For example, the FTSE 100 Index trades at a significant P/E discount relative to its historic average and relative to the Europe ex-U.K. index. Nevertheless, the cheapness of U.K. equities is not new, and, when taking into account the sector composition of the index, ESG factors and currency impact, valuations appear less attractive. For the more domestically oriented FTSE 250 Index, valuations appear elevated after the recent re-rating and slowdown in earnings momentum. Technicals &amp; Sentiment\u2014Supportive*: Looking at fund flows, U.K. equities have been out of favor in the eyes of international investors for over five years, since the Brexit referendum of 2016. In 2021, outflows continued, leaving space for a reversal if fundamentals shift. Sector Views U.S. &amp; European Financials: Positive Fundamentals\u2014Positive: Growth trends and rising interest rates should continue to support the sector in 2022, which saw improving earnings performance in 2021. Valuations\u2014Neutral: Valuations improved toward neutral levels in 2021. Technicals &amp; Sentiment\u2014Neutral: The sector saw positive flows in 2021, reversing some of the negative sentiment that had affected the sector in past years. U.S. &amp; European Traditional Energy: Positive Fundamentals\u2014Positive: We expect oil prices to remain supported in 2022, given the changed reaction function of U.S. producers. They are now more likely to prioritize returns to shareholders over a ramp up in production growth, even amid higher prices. At the current oil price, companies can generate attractive cash flow levels, which can also support high dividend yields. Valuations\u2014Positive: Valuations remain below pre-pandemic levels in many cases and we expect improved profitability to help close this gap. However, valuation upside appears to be limited by overarching investor concerns surrounding energy transition dynamics in the sector. Technicals &amp; Sentiment\u2014Neutral: The sector saw positive flows in 2021, but sentiment remains hindered by ongoing concerns by investors over headwinds coming from the transition to clean energy sources. U.S. Value versus U.S. Growth Fundamentals\u2014Neutral: Growth stocks, despite solid earnings numbers, are more exposed to headwinds from rising rates, which should eventually reduce the premium investors are willing to pay for certain expensive segments of the market. In contrast, many areas of the value segment are likely to be beneficiaries of rising rates as well as the ongoing trend of above-average growth. Valuations\u2014Positive: Value continues to screen as inexpensive versus growth stocks, despite some re-rating at certain points in 2021. Technicals &amp; Sentiment\u2014Supportive: Growth stocks have enjoyed favorable flows since the worst of the pandemic, leaving them more exposed to turns in sentiment. Value stocks show greater potential for further inflows, despite a more positive environment in 2021. Japanese Equities: Neutral Fundamentals\u2014Neutral: The Japanese economy should benefit at the start of 2022 from a reopening, which is later than in the U.S. and Europe. Japan has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, which should help to limit COVID-19 disruptions going forward. Notwithstanding this, many crucial sectors in Japanese indexes continue to be negatively affected by supply-chain bottlenecks, which have blocked the full benefits of a weaker Yen from filtering through to companies. While we expect supply-chain issues to ease in 2022, there is little evidence that the situation will meaningfully improve in the coming months, which will likely impact the Japanese equity market. On balance, we believe these headwinds will make meaningful outperformance versus other DMs hard to achieve, especially at the start of 2022. Valuations\u2014Positive: On a relative basis, Japanese equities trade at significant discount to DM peers, which partly reflects investor concern over longer-term dynamics that, if not addressed, could justify a permanent discount for the asset class. For this reason, we continue to look for environments of strong fundamental tailwinds for the region for a more constructive overall view. Technicals &amp; Sentiment\u2014Neutral: Flows into Japan have continued to reflect caution from investors and concerns over a lack of competitiveness versus other DM markets, with many indicators showing space for an improvement in flows. Recent headlines from Prime Minister Fumio Kishida\u2019s new administration regarding potential changes to buyback regulations will do little, however, to reduce investor concerns over corporate governance and may further diminish foreign interest for the asset class. Asia ex-Japan Equities: Neutral Fundamentals\u2014Neutral: The region will likely be a tale of two stories in 2022. East Asian economic powerhouses, such as Taiwan and Korea, may face some headwinds from a cyclical downturn in semiconductor demand, while secular megatrends and supply-chain disruptions may provide some cushion to growth. Conversely, South East Asia will likely face continued challenges from a multitude of fiscal and economic headwinds, as well as from a higher risk of COVID-19 contagion due to low vaccination rates. Valuations\u2014Neutral: The aggregate index P/E valuation is trading around a 13% premium over the 10-year median, which has retraced significantly from a peak premium of 46% (China\u2019s massive regulatory crackdown contributed most heavily to the decline). From a relative perspective, valuations are trading near their historic discount level of 12% relative to S&amp;P 500 on a 10-year median basis. Technicals &amp; Sentiment \u2014Neutral: Asia ex-Japan saw record fund inflows in 2021, comparable to 2018, according to EPFR, but we have also seen outflows from foreign investors. Sentiment remains weak, as China\u2019s slowdown will have a knock-on impact on its regional trade partners in Asia and increase uncertainty for foreign investors. Chinese Equities: Neutral Fundamentals\u2014Neutral: China will likely face continued regulatory tightening and crackdowns in 2022, as the authorities attempt to restructure the economy in an effort to achieve more sustainable and stable growth in line with government objectives and its 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25). Additionally, the economy is still recovering from the real estate market slowdown. The government has taken minor steps to inject more liquidity, cut reserve requirements and stimulate credit through local government special bonds. However, the overall credit impulse remains languid and has yet to rebound, leaving the fundamental picture uncertain. Valuations\u2014Neutral: The P/E ratio for Chinese equities3 is currently trading at a 13% premium over the 10-year median, but has retraced significantly from the peak premium of 65% in February 2021. While valuations are cheaper, in our view, the huge de-rating is justified by the crackdown on Internet and real estate companies. Relative valuations are trading near historic lows at a 16% discount relative to the S&amp;P 500. A strong credit impulse would be a key catalyst for a positive multiples trend in 2022. Technicals &amp; Sentiment\u2014Unsupportive*: Overall investor sentiment remains weak due to political and regulatory concerns. Despite a large sell-off in Chinese equities, net flows remain positive, suggesting that investors are still adopting a wait-and-see mindset, while sitting on the sidelines. Latin American Equities: Neutral Fundamentals\u2014Negative: Consensus earnings for the region are expected to be significantly lower, if not negative, in 2022, mainly due to decelerating economic activity. Our pessimistic view reflects weaker global growth, declining commodity prices and tightening U.S. monetary policy. In Brazil, the run-up to the October 2022 elections could negatively impact the risk-reward profile, especially if the political uncertainty surrounding the outcome is prolonged. Valuations\u2014Positive: Relative to the broader EM index, Latin American equities look attractively valued across most key valuation metrics. From a P/E perspective, there is a large potential upside from re-rating, as most countries are trading well below historic averages. Technicals &amp; Sentiment\u2014Neutral: While EM equity funds continued to see inflows over the past year, Latin American fund outflows have continued for nine consecutive months, reflecting the ongoing uncertainty for the region\u2019s outlook. Fixed Income U.S. Government Bonds: Negative Fundamentals\u2014Negative: Recent hawkish commentary from the Fed has led the market to price in an aggressive hiking pace, starting in 2022. While we expect Fed hikes to start mid-year, we foresee a slightly less aggressive pace than the market. More importantly, we believe that space exists for improvement in the market\u2019s pricing of the Fed terminal rate. An improvement in this pricing component should open the way to more upward pressure on U.S. long-term rates, leading us to maintain an underweight to duration. Valuations\u2014Negative: U.S. long-term rates still appear to have excessive pessimism priced in regarding longer-term growth and, therefore, screen as expensive against other macro indicators and historic levels. We believe some of this gap will close in 2022, with rates moving moderately upwards and reducing the expensiveness of the asset class. Technicals &amp; Sentiment\u2014Neutral: This year, we expect less support for U.S. long-term rates to come from external demand sources, such as Japanese investors, who may be motivated by expectations of rates moving toward 2%. Market pricing of Fed hikes, on the other hand, appears very hawkish, leaving little room for aggressive surprises on the front end. As a result, the picture for sentiment and technicals is fairly balanced, in our view. European Government Bonds: Negative on Bunds Fundamentals\u2014Negative: We expect lower but above-trend growth in Europe, which should make the European Central Bank comfortable in reducing the amount of monetary easing in the coming year, leaving room for rates to move upwards. Valuations\u2014Negative: Bund rates screen as expensive on most of our metrics, reflecting ongoing uncertainty over the longer-term growth trajectory of the German economy. We expect above-trend growth in 2022 to reduce this uncertainty, helping to normalize valuations. Technicals &amp; Sentiment\u2014Neutral: Increased issuance of AAA-rated EU supra-national debt will potentially cause a decrease in demand for German debt, given the higher yield pickup of EU supra-national debt. Investment Grade (IG) Credit: Negative Fundamentals\u2014Neutral: Economic output should remain above potential in the U.S. and Europe in 2022, supporting revenue and earnings growth for issuers and credit risk premiums for the overall asset class. Central banks are set to scale back or outright remove accommodation over the next year, creating a headwind toward H2 2022 for IG credit. When given the high interest rate sensitivity of IG indexes, there is a risk that total returns will turn out to be slightly negative in 2022, if rates rise. Valuations\u2014Negative: IG credit spreads continued to tighten throughout 2021 and remained in a tight range for most of the year. Currently, spreads are near the pre-GFC lows, limiting the scope for further spread compression, despite still favorable fundamentals and macro conditions. Technicals &amp; Sentiment\u2014Neutral: We continued to see strong inflows in IG credit in 2021 until late in the year when COVID-19 fears resurfaced and the Fed shifted its stance on inflation. As long as rates remain close to historic lows, flows should remain supportive for the asset class. The (net) supply of U.S. dollar and euro IG issuance should decline slightly from 2021 levels, leaving the sentiment and technical picture balanced. High Yield (HY) Credit: Neutral Fundamentals\u2014Positive: The period of balance sheet repair for HY companies is behind us and issuers have started to invest for future growth given the strong global aggregate demand picture in 2021 and going into 2022. Fundamentals are unlikely to worsen in the near-term and HY should be more insulated from higher rates, given the lower duration characteristics of the leading indexes and higher spread cushion than IG credit. Valuations\u2014Negative: As is the case for IG, HY credit spreads in the U.S. and Europe are also near pre-GFC lows. Given the low yield environment and benign macro backdrop expected in H1 2022, there is still some scope for spread tightening, but HY total returns in 2022 should be driven predominantly by carry and less by spread compression. Technicals &amp; Sentiment\u2014Neutral: Flows into high yield credit remained robust in 2021, as fundamentals improved greatly and spreads tightened continually. HY credit issuance is likely to slow further in 2022, with a larger decline in net supply expected in the U.S. than in the Eurozone. Emerging Markets (EM) Debt: Neutral Fundamentals\u2014Neutral: We expect 2022 to remain a challenging year for EM economies. Latin American central banks have hiked interest rates significantly, adding to debt-servicing costs without a significant fall in (strong) inflationary pressures. In EMEA, the economic tailwind from commodities is likely to wane gradually. In Asia, the slowdown in China\u2019s growth is likely to impact its regional trade partners at the same time that Asian central banks appear poised to raise rates. In 2021, EMs had a strong rebound in current accounts and terms of trade driven by robust external demand. However, as external demand gradually softens in 2022, this tailwind could fade. Despite relatively prudent fiscal management during the pandemic, EM economies face higher fiscal deficits and growing debt burdens. Additionally, COVID-19 looks set to remain a sizable roadblock for EM countries in the year ahead. Valuations\u2014Neutral: Based on our forward-looking multifactor model on global growth, the VIX and economic fundamentals, hard currency spreads appear to be fairly valued. However, our oil model implies a slight discount at current prices, given that 36% of the JP Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index are net oil exporters. Meanwhile, commodity prices and external trade imply that EM FX is trading at a discount, but we believe these factors play a less significant role for performance in a non-goldilocks economic environment. Sentiment\u2014Negative: The appetite for hard currency bonds has resumed its uptrend, with cumulative flows exceeding all-time highs, even as the pace slowed toward the end of 2021. For local currency bonds, the cumulative flows briefly touched 2019 highs, rolling over slightly toward the end of the year in 2021. Overall, sentiment for EM economies appear soft, as fundamentals remain weak in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. U.S. Dollar Higher market volatility, a faster pace of rate rises in the U.S., as well as a relative growth advantage for the U.S. versus other DMs, should continue to act as tailwinds for the U.S. dollar in 2022. That said, elevated valuations and some pressure coming from the U.S. current account deficit may limit the upside potential. Oil Moving into 2022, we continue to see restrained supply as the main factor supporting oil prices. Even as OPEC ramps up production, capacity constraints by some members will likely become tight, while U.S. producers are prioritizing shareholder returns over increased production, despite higher prices. Both factors should contribute to lower supply than there would have been otherwise. On the demand side, ongoing disruptions related to COVID-19 remain a significant headwind, but as activity normalizes, we could see a very tight market in 2022, which would likely push oil prices higher than in the pre-pandemic period. *When looking at sentiment, we often read strong outflows and deteriorating sentiment on an asset class as a contrarian positive signal (and vice versa for positive sentiment trends), as there is increased potential of pricing overshooting fundamentals. \u00d7 1 Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, as of November 30, 2021. 2 Europe, Middle East and Africa. \u00d7 RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that the Strategy will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser\u2019s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio\u2019s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio\u2019s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. \u00d7 Andrew Harmstone Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Featured Video Rising rates key in shaping road to recovery - Video Labor market and inflation dynamics are paving the way toward a tightening of monetary policy by the Fed.

{"content": "\" The fragmented nature of the muni market and the heavy influence of retail investors tend to result in inefficiencies that may be exploited to achieve additional return through active management and relative value trading.\u201d New York \u2013 We go into 2022 knowing how hard it will be to surpass the outstanding returns investors saw in 2021, when municipal bonds outperformed every other fixed income asset class on a relative value basis. Among the obstacles investors will face are absolute low rates, richer valuations and the probability of some rate volatility in U.S. Treasurys. Demand and supply drive municipal markets Demand was a primary factor in muni bond outperformance in 2021, as the market witnessed the highest inflows on record going back to 1992. We anticipate that investor demand for the favorable tax treatment will continue to influence the asset class. While muni supply far exceeded expectations in 2021, it was nowhere near enough to satiate such record demand in the market. With the recently passed infrastructure bill no longer including any components that would have impacted muni issuance, we believe that supply will take a backseat to demand in driving muni performance in 2022. One caveat is that those muni provisions may reappear in the Build Back Better Act, but we put the probability of that as fairly low. \u00d7 Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Nisha Patel Director, Portoflio Management - Parametric \u00d7 Featured Video Municipal Bonds and Taxes While it will be hard to surpass the performance of municipal bonds in 2021, Director of Portfolio Management at Parametric, Nisha Patel sees 2022 as another year when investors could benefit from professional management for relative value trading, tax loss harvesting and credit oversight.", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/as-municipal-bonds-remain-an-attractive-diversifier-counteract-absolute-low-rates-with-active-management.html"}

{"content": "\" We believe that agency MBS investors could potentially outperform in the rising rate environment we foresee by moving up in coupon.\u201d Boston \u2013 2021 is a year most agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) investors will be happy to have in the rearview mirror. The agency MBS market underperformed nearly all other U.S. fixed-income sectors in 2021 and suffered only its second negative year over the past 25 years, as measured by the Bloomberg US Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) Index. Both negative years (2013 and 2021) were actually the byproduct of the same event, eight years apart \u2026 tapering of the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing programs. While most agency MBS investors expected the Fed to taper its MBS purchases before 2021 was over, the real surprise of 2021 was the seemingly never-ending amount of supply, which hit the market month after month. The agency MBS market began 2021 with one very solid technical, the Fed absorbing almost 100% of new net issuance early in the year as mortgage rates rose. Coming into 2021, many expected supply for the year would be somewhere around $400 billion, meaning the Fed would be taking out 100% of net supply. After rising nearly 50 basis points in the first quarter, mortgage rates leaked lower for the rest of the year. Lower mortgage rates, a hot U.S. housing market and trillions in pent-up home equity all combined to create record supply in the agency MBS market. To put it in context, in 2021, the MBS market saw nearly three times the supply it has seen on average over the last 20 years. Despite being a government-backed sector, and the Fed purchasing over $400 billion of bonds during 2021, the $800+ billion of supply was too much for the agency MBS market to handle without widening spreads. \u00d7 Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Andrew Szczurowski CFA, Director, Mortgage-Backed Securities - Eaton Vance Management \u00d7", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/a-changing-rate-environment-in-2022-could-benefit-active-mbs-investors.html"}

The key variable is inflation, and whether transitory or persistent the Fed\u2019s response will have a profound impact on asset valuations in the upcoming year. Building our own portfolios we like specific areas in securitized credit, short-duration high yield and emerging markets, amongst others. Full Outlook 2022 seems to be shaping up as a year without a market consensus, but instead a wide range of expectations. The bad news is that the many \u201cunknowns\u201d in the markets are creating deep disagreement amongst professional forecasters in terms of growth, inflation and policy actions. But the good news is that as the \u201cunknowns\u201c morph into \u201cknowns\u201d we believe active and selective investors will find ample opportunities to identify assets with great potential for absolute or relative gains. Central bank policy was a major factor driving asset prices in 2020 and 2021 and will likely to continue to be one into 2022, but with a very important distinction: policy will serve to reduce, not increase, accommodation. Easy policy meant that significant liquidity had been poured into the markets and made \u201cbuying-the-dip\u201d a tried-and-true tactic. Things will be different in 2022 as the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) debates and contemplates raising interest rates and tapering the pace of asset purchases from its quantitative easing (QE) program. However, even though the Fed is expected to raise rates as a means of addressing inflation risks, it does not want to slam on the brakes and tighten financial conditions too much or too quickly. A measured response is required, and anticipation of what exactly that response will be has currently created a wide chasm between forecasters and investors in assessing the corresponding and appropriate valuation of asset prices. The key variable is inflation. If inflation is in fact transitory and falls sufficiently in 2022, the Fed will likely be able to tap the brakes and slow the economy down. If inflation persists and becomes a bigger roadblock, a more draconian solution might be required. Either case, and iterations in between, will have a profound impact on asset valuations in the upcoming year. Navigating Through Uncertainty Macro variables, specifically the shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve and the absolute level of 10-year yields, are early indicators of asset performance and tend to be leading indicators when policy is changing. In the case of credit spreads the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Index is used as a generic and proxy view on the broader credit spread market. We represent our investment view via a four-quadrant risk scenario model based on outcomes we believe fall into a probable category, and that will be adjusted throughout the year as the \u201cunknowns\u201d become more \u201cknown\u201d (Display 1). \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Policy Has Driven Asset Performance, and Will Likely Continue to do so in 2022 \uf065 Source: MSIM as of January 10, 2022. Forecasts/estimates are based on current market conditions, subject to change, and may not necessarily come to pass. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Policy Has Driven Asset Performance, and Will Likely Continue to do so in 2022 Source: MSIM as of January 10, 2022. Forecasts/estimates are based on current market conditions, subject to change, and may not necessarily come to pass. This four-quadrant risk assessment is a general guideline but more importantly a starting point in our investment decision-making process. We are not providing a forecast per se, instead a general view on direction and magnitude. Quadrants I &amp; II represent a constructive risk environment. The key linkage is a Fed that allows the economy to run hot and keep default risks low. A steeper curve informs this most, and an unchanged curve denotes a benign environment and a need for yield or spread products. Quadrants III &amp; IV represent a risk-off investing environment. The Fed tightens financial conditions, messages faster tightening and contracts future growth, increases default risk. Curve flattening informs most. A Few Observations Rising interest rates, accompanied by a flattening yield curve spurred by an aggressive Fed, tightens financial conditions most as reflected in Quadrant III. The general state of financial conditions is a metric used in the Fed\u2019s policy reaction function to measure the availability and cost of credit. Thus, a sharp tightening of financial conditions contracts growth and cashflows most, thereby increasing default risks. While this is not the Fed\u2019s goal, it hinges on whether inflation stabilizes. Quadrant I is the most benign outcome that may result in low volatility and demand from investors to own yield and spread. In our view, some combination of Quadrant II and IV most tightly align with the goals of policy makers. Excess accommodation is removed and there is a modest tightening of financial conditions. Asset prices readjust for this transition in policy and the yield curve will inform us most as to the depth of the adjustment. A steeper curve is more supportive for assets, a flatter curve less so. The Opportunity Set: Active Management and Asset Selection Could Be Big Winners in 2022 Market forecasts are an important element going into 2022. But, the assumptions currently factored into assets prices are just as important, if not more so, as these prices set the initial conditions for expected returns for the upcoming year. Market pricing indicates a short, but sharp, tightening cycle from the Fed and the flattening of the yield curve in the fourth quarter of 2021 indicates that growth will likely moderate in the future. Many indices are already repricing for this outcome. But, this market-driven beta is not where the opportunities are in 2022. As we see it, the opportunity set can be thought of more opportunistically when trying to source alpha. Investment grade corporate fundamentals provide a strong backdrop, but we see more return potential in financials and BBB-rated non-financials. We are cautious on A and above non-financials, companies with M&amp;A risk and seeking a more optimal capital structure that can dilute valuations for bond holders. In the high yield (HY) space absolute spread levels are close to what we consider to be fully-valued, but relative valuations across sectors are reasonable. Loans are expected to have comparable returns to HY bonds, but we prefer short-duration HY versus the broad index. By rating cohort, we see value in single-B rated securities over BB or CCC-rated securities. The sectors we prefer are Energy, Cable/Media/Broadcasting, Retail and Building Materials. Securitized credit, especially related to the consumer and housing, will remain compelling as a short-duration asset class with respectable yields and solid credit fundamentals. Housing in both the U.S. and Europe remain well-supported by price appreciation of the underlying assets and the credit quality of borrowers. We are wary, however, of commercial real estate but this varies greatly by sector. Agency mortgage-backed securities may also lose a tailwind from Fed purchases and may cheapen in 2022. Local emerging markets (EM) stands out as a laggard in 2021 with a lot of room for improvement in 2022. This is because EM central banks have been well ahead of developed markets in terms of policy rate hikes designed to stem inflation risks. If inflation stabilizes as we expect in 2022, then both local EM debt and currencies stand to appreciate as global investors will be attracted to the yield, carry and potential returns from this asset class. \u00d7 RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. High-yield securities (\u201cjunk bonds\u201d) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). \u00d7 Jim Caron Portfolio Manager and Chief Fixed Income Strategist Global Fixed Income Team Multi-Sector Fixed Income Team Featured Video No Market Consensus Widens the Opportunity Set - Video Jim Caron, Portfolio Manager and Chief Fixed Income Strategist for the Global Fixed Income team shares his thoughts on 2022.", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/no-market-consensus-widens-the-opportunity-set.html"}
{"content": "Emerging markets (EM) have fallen off the radar after the worst decade for emerging stock market returns since the 1930s\u2014and to makes matters worse, EM equities had another disappointing year in 2021. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index was down -2.5%,1 underperforming the MSCI World Index by 24%,1 due to a number of factors including: an economic slowdown driven by policy tightening, regulatory crackdown in China, inflation overhang, dollar strength, EM currency weakness and COVID-19 shocks. Several critical catalysts, however, should turn the macro environment positive for the EM asset class in 2022 and beyond with better expected outcomes than in the past decade. \u00d7 Over much of the last decade, investors had eyes for only two countries, the United States and China, and mainly one sector, tech. But history shows that the hot investment themes of one decade rarely remain hot in the next decade, which is why we are expecting a revival of the rest, namely several countries outside the two superpowers, and many companies outside big tech. After such a weak decade for EM returns (Display 1), the gap between EM and U.S. valuations has never been wider, as Display 2 shows. And with the growth prospects of emerging economies, especially ex-China, rising relative to the U.S., we believe this is the time to invest in select areas of EM. These extremes are likely to normalize, closing the valuation and performance gap with the U.S. \u00d7 Display 1: The 2010s: The Worst Decade for EM Equities Since the 1930s \uf065 The index performance is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment.

See Important Information section for index definitions. Source: MSIM, Bloomberg, FactSet, Haver. As of December 31, 2021. We expect a comeback for emerging markets equities over the next five to ten years, with our top reasons summarized below. Recovery Post Pandemic Emerging markets lacked resources to spend their way through the pandemic and have lagged the U.S. in terms of a growth rebound. While we cannot project the path of the virus and its seemingly endless mutations, we have observed that the pandemic\u2019s effects on emerging countries are minimizing with each wave. This is due in part to vaccinations and more widespread immunity, to the point where we expect emerging markets will have learned to live with this virus and economic life should recover. In addition, emerging markets are in stronger positions now from an external and balance of payments standpoint, and ex-China developing countries have de-levered over the past several years. Financial stocks are one way to invest in an EM recovery as they can benefit from improving credit cycles, rising interest rates and positive yield curves. Additionally, banks with effective fintech strategies will likely be the beneficiaries of a rising demand for credit, and realize greater profitability. EM consumer themes should also perform well if domestic demand gains traction. Pandemic-Inspired Reform Stories History shows that developing countries reform when their backs are against the wall. Unlike in the U.S., emerging markets did not have the monetary and fiscal muscle to stimulate economies during the pandemic, forcing several EM countries to enact tough, productivity-enhancing economic reform, which should help drive future growth. For example, in India, moves toward government divestment from the state-owned airline and the creation of a \u201cbad bank\u201d to address non-performing loans are positive signs. Indonesia passed an omnibus law to address labor laws and attract foreign investment, and Russia continues to maintain fiscal and monetary orthodoxy, which has materially reduced its economy\u2019s vulnerability to oil volatility and other external shocks. Manufacturing Success Stories Historically, many emerging markets were able to export their way to prosperity, where manufacturing, export-oriented economies were among the growth stars. In this era of de-globalization, this path is narrowing, with increasing trade restrictions and more countries\u2014and companies\u2014turning inward. As manufacturing moves out of China, a few countries are emerging as winners in Southeast Asia, like Vietnam, and in Eastern Europe, like Poland. Mexico and India are also notably increasing their share of exports in the global economy. Revival of Commodities We believe global commodity prices are poised for a sustainable rebound. On one hand, moving to a cleaner economy and net-zero emissions is boosting demand for copper, aluminum, platinum, lithium and other \u201cgreen\u201d commodities. On the other hand, commodities have already gone through a decade of supply discipline after the boom in the 2000s, while at the same time environmental and social considerations are leading to tightening regulation and supply constraints of carbon-intensive minerals. The result is \u201cgreenflation,\u201d an expected rise in prices for the raw materials needed in renewable energy plants, electric vehicles and other clean technologies. Rising commodity prices will benefit commodity-intensive countries and companies. The Digital Revolution For many decades, manufacturing has proven to be the \u201ckiller app\u201d driving growth and convergence in emerging markets. Today, it is the digital revolution that is blossoming as a powerful growth and productivity driver. More importantly, this digital revolution is spreading in emerging markets much faster than in the developed world, as the absence of legacy infrastructure has been one of the key drivers of this rapid digital change. The adoption of smartphones, increasing bandwidth and internet usage is facilitating online shopping, banking, and the launch of new business services, all of which are helping dramatically transform domestic economies. Similar to the U.S. and China\u2019s internet companies, local digital companies are providing online services everywhere from Asia to South America to Africa, and are progressing just in time as manufacturing fades as a growth driver in many parts of EM. The advantage of catering to local tastes and languages creates a new and wide suite of services including search, shopping, travel, entertainment, consumer finance and other services, all while simultaneously increasing productivity. Investment Implications In our Emerging Markets strategies, we are actively invested in markets, themes and companies that we believe are best positioned to prosper from one or more of the five trends outlined above, across focused portfolios of quality growth stocks. We believe these growth drivers will help GDP growth differentials and equity market returns positively converge to power the emerging markets equities asset class after more than a decade of underperforming the U.S. Specific opportunities we are looking to capitalize on include: Signs of economic recovery in select markets where we expect a greater demand for credit, particularly in countries that have avoided or cleaned up past debt problems, as in Central Europe, India and Southeast Asia. The pandemic-inspired reform efforts are widespread but perhaps most dramatic in Indonesia and India. We are seeing improving prospects for policy reform in other countries such as South Africa. The emerging markets rising as export manufacturers are concentrated in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe, led by Vietnam and Poland. Demand for green technology is supporting select mineral stocks that are part of a carbon reduction solution, and we have our eye on countries that should benefit from rising commodity prices. For example, the move to a hydrogen economy should help boost exporters of platinum, led by countries like South Africa and Russia. Most intriguingly, the digital revolution is seeing new regional versions of the Chinese and American tech giants rise across every region in EM, from Latin America to Africa to East Asia. Digitization is creating opportunities across industries, with local and regional winners arising in areas like e-commerce, digital payments and entertainment. \u00d7 Top Five Reasons for an EM Equity Comeback RECOVERY POST PANDEMIC: After lagging developed markets, emerging markets are learning to live with the virus and are in a stronger position for an economic rebound. PANDEMIC-INSPIRED REFORM STORIES: Lacking the resources to spend their way through the pandemic, many emerging world governments have been forced to enact painful but necessary economic reform, which is likely to accelerate growth in coming years. MANUFACTURING SUCCESS STORIES: Some emerging markets are still able to increase their share of global exports, a traditional source of growth for developing economies. REVIVAL OF COMMODITIES: The unfolding revival of commodity prices, in part due to \u201cgreenflation,\u201d the rise in prices for raw materials required for green investments, is a bright sign for the many EMs that rely on commodity exports. THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION: The pandemic is accelerating the digital revolution, and one of the least understood aspects is that it is manifesting even faster in emerging markets than in developed ones. \u00d7 Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio\u2019s performance. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Privately placed and restricted securities may be subject to resale restrictions as well as a lack of publicly available information, which will increase their illiquidity and could adversely affect the ability to value and sell them (liquidity risk). China risk. Investments in China involve risk of a total loss due to government action or inaction. Additionally, the Chinese economy is export driven and highly reliant on trade. Adverse changes to the economic conditions of its primary trading partners, such as the United States, Japan and South Korea, would adversely impact the Chinese economy and the Fund\u2019s investments. Moreover, a slowdown in other significant economies of the world, such as the United States, the European Union and certain Asian countries, may adversely affect economic growth in China. An economic downturn in China would adversely impact the Portfolio\u2019s investments. Risks of investing through Stock Connect. Any investments in A-shares listed and traded through Stock Connect, or on such other stock exchanges in China which participate in Stock Connect is subject to a number of restrictions that may affect the Portfolio's investments and returns. Moreover, Stock Connect A-shares generally may not be sold, purchased or otherwise transferred other than through Stock Connect in accordance with applicable rules. The Stock Connect program may be subject to further interpretation and guidance. There can be no assurance as to the program\u2019s continued existence or whether future developments regarding the program may restrict or adversely affect the Portfolio's investments or returns. \u00d7 Jitania Kandhari Head of Macro and Thematic Research Emerging Markets Equity Team Featured Video Capturing Opportunity in Fast-Changing Emerging Markets - Video EM equities are poised for a comeback in 2022 and beyond.

{"content": "In 2022, we believe the most notable trends will be the continuation of ones that gathered strength in 2021: Higher volatility levels in both the equity and fixed income markets leading to wider dispersion in performance of stocks, bonds and off-the-run investment opportunities. The main volatility drivers were\u2014and continue to be\u2014 the triumvirate of headlines that became all-too-familiar: Tightening of monetary policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve, increasing inflation, and the uncontrolled growing spread of COVID-19. Hedge funds performed well through this volatility (Display 1). \u00d7 DISPLAY 1 Hedge funds had solid performance in 2021. \uf065 Source: HFR, Inc., as of November 30, 2021. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1 Hedge funds had solid performance in 2021. Source: HFR, Inc., as of November 30, 2021. Risk management seen as key to hedge fund success in 2022 In contrast, risk markets in prior years were mostly driven by accommodative Fed policy and fiscal stimulus, creating an ideal environment that lifted all boats and beta returns. Hedge funds, which limit market risks and seek to generate alpha, underperformed. But rising volatility and performance dispersion create a fertile field for hedge fund managers, who found their footing again in 2021, as shown by alpha production in Display 2. The rolling two-year average annualized alpha has been positive all year and is the highest it has been since January 2018. One needs to go back to August 2011 to find prior periods of such strong and consistent alpha production. \u00d7 DISPLAY 2 Hedge fund managers have generated alpha consistently for the past two years. \uf065 Source: HFR, Inc., as of November 30, 2021. \u00d7 DISPLAY 2 Hedge fund managers have generated alpha consistently for the past two years. Source: HFR, Inc., as of November 30, 2021. The changing nature of risk We believe that the biggest challenge to hedge funds in 2022 will be the changing nature of market risk. Hedging unwanted market exposure has always been key to protecting alpha, but doing so has become more complicated and nuanced. For example, the impact of \u201crisk on/ risk off\u201d episodes has typically been effectively hedged with the S&amp;P 500 Index, largely because factors like growth, momentum and value have had reasonably consistent\u2014and predictable\u2014 performance during such periods. But the same has not held for \u201cCOVID on/COVID off\u201d episodes. Investors have had to rapidly switch between the prospects of the economy opening up and shutting down, and the related impacts on stocks from labor shortages, supply chain dynamics and so forth. Performance factors underwent large shifts in direction and magnitude, and as a result, the S&amp;P 500 became too blunt a tool for hedging in that environment. Factor exposures associated with hedge funds have been behaving very differently than the market, as can be seen in the last few days of November 2021 (Display 3). \u00d7 DISPLAY 3 In \u201cCOVID on/COVID off\u201d episodes, factor exposures behaved very differently than the S&amp;P 500. \uf065 Past returns are not indicative of future results.

Past returns are not indicative of future results. Source: Barra (US Barra Medium Term Model) The Omicron scare We saw the impact of this in the wake of the Omicron scare of November 2021, when managers with good security selection lagged the quick rebound in the S&amp;P 500. For effective risk management, managers have to know how a basket of principal factor risks maps onto their portfolios. Many clearly didn\u2019t have a refined understanding of this \u201cmap\u201d in the evolving COVID on/COVID off world, which likely led to overhedging or other uneven factor exposures. Another clue comes from the relative performance of classic long/short managers in comparison with multi-portfolio manager platforms. We believe that the multi-PM platforms generally can have a structural advantage for risk management. Assuming the platforms devote sufficient resources and expertise to that function, they potentially can manage risk across more dimensions and continually develop the map connecting factors to positions. Even after accounting for their higher-cost pass-through structure, the after-fee results of the Platform Peer Group (Display 4) and their respective investment profile compare favorably. \u00d7 DISPLAY 4 Multi-PM platforms have outperformed classic long/short hedge funds. \uf065 Sources: HFR, Inc., Morgan Stanley.

From December 31, 2016 to November 30, 2021. COVID is hardly the only likely source of volatility in 2022. The Fed\u2019s tapering is potentially a major source, given the conflicting currents the central bank may have to navigate, with inflation prints coming in over 6% and the 10-year U.S. Treasury around 1.5% as of December 2021. An accelerated tightening policy could slow growth, especially if there is a parallel drag from COVID developments, and no one\u2014including the Fed\u2014really knows the optimal rate level for slowing inflation without harming the recovery. The economy has been shaped by super-easy money for a long time. Even an increase of 75 basis points in 2022, as contemplated by the Fed, is a big adjustment, and it is a big leap of faith to assume it will be a smooth one. Implications for 2022 Our outlook for more volatility and dispersion in performance for 2022 has a number of implications: SECURITY SELECTION is likely to play a larger role in alpha generation, given the expected start/stop nature of the markets and related choppiness that is likely to disrupt sector trends and broader thematic investing. By the same logic, the intrasector opportunity set looks promising as a source of idiosyncratic return independent of COVID on/COVID off, inflation or other macro influences. As noted earlier, long/short strategies that are supported tightly by risk management, tend to preserve alpha better (Display 4). DIVERSIFICATION OF ALPHA SOURCES becomes especially important because dispersion is a double-edged sword that increases both the number of opportunities and the chance of bad calls. Controlling intermanager correlations is critical\u2014it ensures risks do not overlap and helps minimize losses from bad calls. PROMISING STRATEGIES for us include global macro, with managers agile enough to capture the value of the cross currents in today\u2019s environment, with a short-term, tactically oriented approach. Select commodity strategies fall in this category, such as taking advantage of quick-shifting currents in supply and demand in metals, livestock and agricultural markets, or even relative value trading in the oil markets between West Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude. However, pure price moves are only part of the story, as specialists can also maximize calendar spreads, contract rolls and physical delivery features. Less appealing strategies include long-bias credit risk, where spreads are at historically tight levels, and mortgage arbitrage\u2014a sector hindered by a limited upside and the fact that duration typically lengthens as rates rise. USING HEDGE FUNDS AS DIVERSIFIERS in classic 60/40 stock/bond portfolios can help address a fundamental problem with bonds in 2022: Most fixed-income sectors are long duration. For example, with a duration of 6.6 years, the Bloomberg Aggregate Index would lose over 6% of its value with each 1% increase in rates, and would be unlikely to provide much of a hedge for equities in that scenario. As absolute-return vehicles, hedge funds typically have a low beta to equities and rates, and thus may be an attractive hedge complement for bonds in 2022. CRISIS RISK OFFSET STRATEGIES deserve consideration by investors seeking protection from tail risk events. Such hedging strategies seek to deliver positive returns during loss scenarios while reducing outright costs in normal markets. They can also provide the requisite diversification needed to allow for continued exposure to desired risks. Some risk offset programs are designed to even provide liquidity during times of significant market crisis. Changing with changing risk The volatility and dispersion of returns we expect in 2022 suggest that security selection will be a key driver of returns. But this environment will demand more from managers. We believe success will also require sophisticated portfolio construction, supported by a nuanced understanding of hedging as factor exposures change in the COVID on/ COVID off world. In our view, investors would benefit from considering hedge funds constructed with diversified alpha sources and a strong risk management process. \u00d7 Mark van der Zwan Chief Investment Officer and Head of AIP Hedge Fund Solutions", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/hedge-funds-in-2022-changing-with-changing-risk.html"}
{"content": "If we rewind the clock one year and look at our January 2021 Outlook: \u201cWe expect 2021 to be similar to 2010, the second year of a new bull market. Following the historically strong year in 2009, the market returned a good year overall in 2010.1\u201d In 2010, the S&amp;P 500 returned just over 15%. 2021? A +28.4% percent return. Hey, how about that. . .we got it right. Make no mistake, I\u2019m not a market sage. But what I am is a market historian and it is clear to me that patterns tend to repeat themselves, primarily because human behavior really does not change. Central banks pump liquidity to solve economic problems, but investors only start to feel better about the situation as the problem recedes into the rear-view mirror. Usually it takes at least one year before investor sentiment lifts. The ensuing 2021 inflows combined with stellar corporate earnings results drove equities up in the past year just as they did in 1991, 2003 and 2010, all second years after recessionary lows. For those who predicted a more bearish 2021.\u2026well, so be it. As I see it the biggest issue with their subpar prognostication is that history told us it was simply too soon following the March 2020 recessionary low to become negative. We were on the mark for 2021, but a new year is upon us. Let\u2019s take a look at what 2022 might bring. Display 1 paints a historical picture, giving us some clues. As you can see equities historically perform well in the second year following recession lows (the latest in March 2020). It turns out caution in 2021 appeared way too premature as the story turned out to be about good old-fashioned corporate fundamentals, the key to stock prices. Corporate earnings, the E in the Price/Earnings ratio, were up 26% in 2021, much, much better than expected. As such it should be no surprise that the P, Price, was up +28%, with the S&amp;P 500 Index following right along. The 2021 bull market was as straightforward as this: Wall Street was too darned pessimistic about corporate America! \u00d7 Display 1: 2021 was a consistent with history. Could 2022 be as well? \uf065 Source: Bloomberg. The index performance is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment.

The index performance is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. See disclosure below for index definitions. Now if we look at 2022, the third post-recessionary year, we expect something different but not necessarily bearish. The key difference between the second and third Years post-recession is that in the second year, the Fed is still your friend and quite accommodative. But, in the third, the Fed starts to become less accommodative and less friendly, more of a mere \u201cacquaintance.\u201d Hospitable, but not necessarily helpful. Given this historical consistency we expect positive, but far more modest equity returns in 2022. And this makes sense to me. 2021 produced strong corporate fundamentals AND a supremely accommodative Fed. In 2022, however, there will likely be more tension between the two. On one hand, we believe strong corporate fundamentals will continue to exceed Wall Street\u2019s expectations, yet on the other, central bank policy will begin to pivot from its accommodative stance and throw a little cold water on the environment. We believe that will result in lower, but positive returns, most likely in the mid to high single-digits. Too simplistic? Perhaps. Fair criticism. Yet, what I know is that the bear calls for significant corrections in 2021 kept many investors on the sidelines resulting in a loss of focus on what really matters. Namely that stocks have done well in the second year of a bull market. In fact, my biggest worry going into 2022 is a 10% correction, a significant drawdown that could startle investors and push them out of the market. In my mind though, a correction would actually be a GOOD thing, maybe even a buying opportunity. Another worry about 2022 returns will be the mid-term elections in November, as the mid-term election year returns are historically the lowest in in the four years of a presidential term. But despite these worries we expect a solid, if unspectacular, 2022. Specifically we like US Value, which we consider quite cheap at the moment and should do well if inflation is persistent in the upcoming year. We also believe the US dollar will weaken making some EM equities attractive. We are less excited about Europe and Japan but are keeping a close eye on China where the People\u2019s Bank of China might be the only dovish central bank in the world. In the end, based on history I suspect the Bulls will outshine the Bears yet again in 2022. And of course, this is at the overall S&amp;P 500 level. Alpha opportunities for active stock picking will abound, just as they have this year. \u00d7 1 2021 Slimmon\u2019s TAKE: 2021 Market Outlook, January 2021 \u00d7 RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a mutual fund will achieve its investment objective. Funds are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the fund will decline and that the value of fund shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this fund. Please be aware that this fund may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-and medium-capitalization companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. \u00d7 Andrew Slimmon Head of Applied Equity Advisors Team Featured Funds Global Concentrated Portfolio MLNIX | Class I Global Core Portfolio MLMIX | Class I US Core Portfolio MUOIX | Class I Previous Next Featured Video History Is Not To Be Ignored - Video Andrew Slimmon, Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of the Applied Equity Advisors team for the shares his thoughts on 2022.", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/history-is-not-to-be-ignored.html"}
{"content": "Financial markets had a good December despite Covid infections rising rapidly at the end of the month as the more contagious Omicron variant took over. Equities rallied, credit spreads tightened and even emerging markets had a good month, reversing much, if not all, of the sell offs in equities and credit in the second half of November. Government bond yields did rise, and have continued to rise further in January, in some countries substantially, but the increases in Europe and the U.S. did not dent the overall bullish economic outlook and merely returned yields to the ranges prevailing for most of the second half of 2021. The economic outlook brightened meaningfully in the fourth quarter as manufacturing output improved significantly as supply constraints began to ease and inventories are being restocked. \u00d7 However, the end of 2021 looks very different from how it began. The year began positively: vaccines and massive fiscal stimulus were coming and, importantly, inflation was well contained, with the market and U.S Federal Reserve (Fed) projecting no changes in monetary policy until at least mid-2023. Currently the world faces a highly contagious variant, a very hawkish Fed with multiple 2022 rate hikes priced in, U.S fiscal policy in limbo and surging inflation. So, while on the surface things in early 2022 look like early 2021, it is not d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu by any stretch of the imagination. Three questions need to be answered. First, how impactful, economically speaking, will Omicron be? Second, how much should markets fear the Fed? Third, will inflation slow? The Omicron wave has pushed global infections to record highs before it has even hit Asia. This is likely to negatively impact growth. Our working assumption is that the Omicron wave will burn itself out relatively quickly due to its greater contagiousness, reduced virulence and high levels of vaccinations so that economic activity will take a hit in the first quarter, but it should not be too large. It should also impact services (increased cautiousness, reduced mobility) more than goods. Its impact on inflation is somewhat ambiguous as it will hit services supply (reduced) and demand (reduced) with goods output relatively unaffected. Fed behavior in 2022 is likely to have a more long-lasting impact than Omicron (we truly hope!). The Fed has turned decisively hawkish. There appears to be minimal to no dissent to raising rates multiple (two to four) times in 2022, starting as soon as May, accelerating tapering, ending quantitative easing (QE) in March/April, and beginning quantitative tightening (a.k.a. shrinking the balance sheet), potentially also by mid-year. Crucially, what the Fed has not done, at least not yet, nor the market, is raise the expected terminal Fed funds rate. The market thinks it is in the 1.75% - 2.00% range and the Fed is at 2.25% - 2.50%. Two possibly non-mutually exclusive bearish things can happen: the market increases its pricing to be in line with the Fed\u2019s forecast, which would push longer maturity yields higher, and the Fed could find itself fighting a stubborn inflation wave whereby it might increase its terminal rate forecast higher yet. This reduction in liquidity in 2022 and higher rates (market has already priced in 3+ hikes this year) will support higher bond yields. Quantitative tightening (QT) may be the trigger for a steeper yield curve in 2022. However, the biggest risk to financial markets is how the Fed manages its balance sheet. The market knows how to price rate hikes; it is much more uncertain as to what to do with potentially rapid balance sheet shrinkage. Lastly, the inflation outlook is of paramount importance as the unexpectedly large global inflation shock is what is driving tighter monetary policy in so many countries, not just in the U.S but also many emerging markets, Canada, UK, Australia, Norway and New Zealand. The good news, we believe, is that inflation will come off the boil in the first quarter as energy inflation subsides. This will be the first drop in this expansion. Unfortunately, this drop in headline inflation does not mean that core inflation will drop. The trajectory of core inflation has been buffeted by both supply and demand shocks. Core inflation should stabilize at a minimum and hopefully fall, if only marginally. But the good news is that for the first time in over a year the markets will likely see inflation fall. The question is, will it fall enough to prevent central banks from tightening more than expected? In terms of market views, we have generally been reducing portfolio risk into year-end given the uncertain outlook. We remain long risky assets (corporate credit, securitized credit, emerging markets) because of the positive economic outlook (slower but still strong growth/lower inflation) and expectations that Omicron will leave economies relatively unscathed. We expect developed economy government bond yields to continue to move higher but, as we have seen multiple times in the past, they remain at the mercy of risky asset performance, shifting/unstable risk preferences, and Covid. \u00d7 Display 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date \uf065 Note: USD-based performance.

Fixed Income Outlook December turned out very well for most asset markets, both in absolute terms and relative to what happened in November, when markets performed poorly. The flattening of yield curves slowed a bit but still flattened. Government bond yields generally rose, giving back much of the November rally. Interestingly, the English-speaking country bond markets outperformed even though their respective central banks are the most hawkish.1 Impressively, high yield bonds recouped all they lost in November with investment grade not far behind, not completely recovering all that was lost in the second half of November.2 The downside to this December rally in credit markets is it reduces 2022 expected returns, especially given the Fed\u2019s decisive turn to hawkishness. How the Omicron infection wave plays out will have a significant impact on economies and markets. Given its behavior to date, our assumption is that it will not disrupt underlying economic trends or policy reactions significantly. For sure, certain sectors of the economy will be impacted in the short run, but it is expected to be short-lived, and we can expect underlying trends to remain robust. Those trends look supportive for growth and corporate cash flow and, unfortunately, above target inflation. 2022, like 2021, should be another year of above trend growth with the U.S achieving full employment (however defined) and most other countries recouping or surpassing previous levels of output and employment. Unfortunately, high and persistent levels of inflation have also triggered changes in monetary policy expectations. The trend of central banks globally reducing accommodation is intensifying relative to what was expected just a month ago. How this is executed will be a defining event in 2022. One of the biggest surprises in 2021 was the decline in real yields. Developed economies boomed, unemployment rates fell significantly, wages rose more than expected and inflation roared back. Indeed, 2021 was a year of large upside surprises in inflation, the first in over 20 years of undershooting expectations and forecasts. Despite this very strong macroeconomic backdrop, nominal yields surprisingly fell over the last three quarters of the year and pushed real yields deep into negative territory. Current market pricing is for real yields across the yield curve to stay negative far into the future. This is a very pessimistic forecast and one unlikely to be true if secular stagnation does not return (although we cannot completely dismiss the possibility). The depressed state of real yields is a function of a variety of factors that should dissipate in importance, like all-time easy monetary policy. The Fed needs real yields to rise to slow inflation. How high they need to go will depend on the financial market\u2019s reaction. The more long-term yields rise, the less tightening required. The expected move to begin QT adds an element of uncertainty as markets do not have much experience in handicapping a higher rates/QT combo (nor does the Fed). Real yields led by the U.S. are already moving higher in anticipation of these events. Therefore, nominal and real yields should move higher in 2022 as liquidity is withdrawn and inflation falls. One important factor keeping longer maturity yields low (outside of massive global liquidity) is, in our view, expectations that terminal rates, i.e., the peak in policy rates, will not reach new highs. Indeed, current market expectations are that peak rates this cycle will be meaningfully lower than last cycle (2015-2018). The risk to bond valuations comes more from the length of the hiking cycle and the eventual terminal policy rate rather than the pace or start date (although they matter for the shape of the yield curve). With inflation proving to be stubborn, there is a danger expected terminal rates will be moved higher by both the market and Fed. That said, we believe inflation will fall in 2022, growth in output and employment will slow, and the Fed will calibrate its tightening cycle as more information arrives. It may be true that this is just an inflation scare. By mid-year, when we know more about how fast inflation is falling, the Fed will be able to slow down its tightening. Of course, the opposite is true as well! Other central banks will be reinforcing the Fed\u2019s message with the Bank of Canada (BoC) primed to raise rates soon (beating the Fed to the starting line), while the Bank of England (BoE), Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) and Norges Bank have already started hiking. Most emerging market (EM) central banks have been raising rates, aggressively in many cases, for most of the last 12 months. While we can expect more hikes if inflation keeps rising, given their head start, it is likely that they will be able to stop hiking rates even with the Fed in rate hiking mode if their economies should weaken and inflation rates fall. The European Central Bank (ECB) is going at a slower pace, given it is not yet convinced inflation will not fall below its target level again after the inflation shock is over, but it will significantly reduce, and possibly end, QE this year, which should prevent yields from falling. Even in Japan, inflation is turning out higher than expected and with no changes in Bank of Japan (BoJ) policy priced in, this could be a source of policy surprise in 2022. Only in China is monetary policy diverging from the Fed. Their zero Covid strategy and attempts to balance growth objectives with deleveraging is going to keep the Chinese central bank in accommodative mode in 2022. Credit investors have also become more nervous recently, causing credit spreads to widen; we think this is mainly reflective of how tight spreads became, rather than any meaningful increase in default risk or deteriorating fundamentals. Further widening could be a buying opportunity. EM risk remains predominantly on the local side. Very hawkish central banks, with inflation pressures still evident, make it premature, despite significant rate hikes in recent months, to get bullish. The Fed moving to a less accommodative posture in the months ahead is also likely to be a challenge. Politics in several countries is taking its toll. Where does this leave our views on markets? In general, we remain overweight the riskier, cyclical sectors but less so than several months ago. We think high yield, securitized credit and floating-rate loans will outperform government bonds, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and investment grade credit, but by less than in 2021. We think low expected terminal rates and highly negative real yields make longer-maturity bonds relatively unappealing. However, this outcome is contingent on the Fed not overdoing it, either on purpose or by accident. If markets sense recession risks rising, performance rankings will flip with investment grade and government bonds expected to outperform. Local EM looks interesting given how much central banks raised rates. Examples include Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, and Russian local bonds. On the external side, we are more selective, but do expect high yielding sovereign bonds to reverse their 2021 underperformance. Once inflation peaks, substantial risk premiums should fall. Shorter maturity bonds are more interesting due to much higher risk premiums now priced in. How China manages their zero-Covid strategy will also be impactful both on the demand and supply sides. And, of course, Omicron remains a risk as does the risk of another unknown variant showing up. Developed Market Rate/Foreign Currency Monthly Review Two key storylines drove rates in developed markets in December: the Omicron variant and central bank policy meetings. Overall, although the month began with rates briefly falling following a flight-to-safety given Omicron fears, developed market rates for the most part ended the month higher. The U.S. dollar did not move significantly in December, while emerging market currencies were mixed. Outlook Monetary policy and Covid circumstances will continue to drive DM rate movements. We see the risks skewed towards higher inflation, leading to a hawkish central bank bias and higher rates as well as steeper yield curves. Overall, we see value in many EM currencies versus G10. Emerging Market Rate/Foreign Currency Monthly Review EM debt returns were positive in December. Hard currency sovereigns performed well driven by tighter spreads, although partially offset by higher U.S Treasury yields.3 EM corporate returns were positive for the month, with high yield outperforming investment grade corporates.4 Local currency bonds posted positive returns, primarily due to stronger EM currencies against the U.S. dollar.5 Outlook We moved from a cautious to an opportunistic outlook for EM debt. Though tighter global monetary policy, elevated inflation, and uncertainty over the Omicron variant may limit scope for a sizable rally in risky assets, global growth remains solid and commodity prices recovered during the month. In such a backdrop, there is room for high yield EM credit to outperform investment grade. On the local side, some currencies look substantially cheap and could outperform in a scenario where uncertainty subsides. In local rates, we prefer yield curves that are already pricing in aggressive monetary policy tightening. Corporate Credit Monthly Review Corporate credit spreads tightened meaningfully in December as risky assets in general rallied. Corporate news in the month was limited due to the holidays, but M&amp;A remained a constant theme with the cheap debt and expected economic rebound in 2022 driving deals. The high yield market recorded a strong return in December, despite volatility remaining sharply elevated, led by lower credit quality. Global convertibles underperformed both equity and credit for the second consecutive month in December, led largely by asset class underweights to the best-performing equity sectors: Energy, Financials, Real Estate and Materials. Outlook We see little change in the base case credit outlook with valuations looking full but fundamentals well supported. We expect some volatility in early 2022 given the current uncertainty and lack of appetite for risk positioning. Floating-Rate Loans Monthly Review Robust investor demand for floating-rate assets fuelled the senior loan market\u2019s rebound in December. Fundamentals continued to showcase healthy credit conditions and quality-level themes followed the familiar Covid-era risk-on form: lower-rated loans outperformed. Outlook We expect continued strong technicals and fundamentals. The healthy credit picture and investors\u2019 ongoing search for yield will drive continued flows to the sector. Additionally, above trend economic growth, strong credit metrics and low default rates will create a strong fundamental environment. Securitized Products Monthly Review Mortgage and securitized markets were generally quiet in December, both in terms of trading activity and pricing volatility. Securitized new issuance volumes set post-financial crisis records for 2021, despite a slower December. Spreads were slightly tighter in agency MBS.6 Agency MBS demand remains robust as the Fed is still net buying MBS and reinvesting prepayments (despite reducing the size of net buying) and U.S banks continue to increase their holdings. Non-agency RMBS, CMBS and ABS spreads were generally wider during the month, however performance varied significantly by sub-sector.7 Outlook Overall, we believe the securitized market offers an attractive combination of low duration and attractive yields with solid credit fundamentals. We remain constructive on securitized credit and are modestly overweight. We remain cautious on agency MBS and interest rate risk, and we continue to manage portfolios with relatively short durations. \u00d7 1 Source: Bloomberg Global Treasury indices.

There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. \u00d7 Global Fixed Income Team Our fixed income investment capabilities are driven by eight specialized teams \u2013 Agency MBS, Emerging Markets, Floating-Rate Loans, High Yield, Investment Grade Credit, Municipals, Multi-Sector, and Securitized \u2013 which span the global fixed income capital markets.

Today, the implied yield curve may well be signaling the start of another U.S. economic expansion \u2013 a positive portent for value equities. We believe that adding some value equity to client portfolios as a diversification1 hedge against other more correlated assets will ultimately prove to be the path to building better outcomes. Stars Potentially Aligning for Value Equity \u2026 While our Opportunistic Value investing approach focuses on individual stock picking, the U.S. macroeconomic backdrop is setting up to favor value equities, broadly. Our research shows that value equity indexes \u2500 with their heavy weighting of cyclically sensitive sectors such as finance, energy and basic materials \u2500 tend to outperform during expansionary, reflationary economic periods. These periods of outperformance, exemplified by accelerating profit growth, can often last many years and are often preceded by severe economic contractions such as the one we just experienced (see outperformance of Russell 1000 Value from 1981-1986, 1992-1993, 2000-2006).2 One common feature marking the onset of past U.S. economic expansions has been a steepening of the U.S. yield curve (Display 1). Typically, as the U.S. begins to recover, monetary authorities remain accommodative on the short end, while longer-term nominal rates (including their embedded inflation premium) tend to remain more elevated \u2013 steepening the curve. As shown in Display 1, the implied yield curve today may be signaling the start of another U.S. economic expansion \u2013 a positive portent for value equities. \u00d7 Display 1: U.S. Economic Expansions Generally Begin with a Steep Yield CurveTen-Year Treasury Bonds Versus Shadow Fed Funds Rates 1992 Through Mid-November 2021 \uf065 Source: Empirical Research Partners; Bloomberg; NBER Past performance is no guarantee of future results. \u00d7 Display 1: U.S. Economic Expansions Generally Begin with a Steep Yield CurveTen-Year Treasury Bonds Versus Shadow Fed Funds Rates 1992 Through Mid-November 2021 Source: Empirical Research Partners; Bloomberg; NBER Past performance is no guarantee of future results. \u2026 if Investors Are Willing to Seize the Opportunity Studies show an unprecedented level of correlation in recent times between narrow growth areas of the equity market and long-duration bonds. Further, these asset classes have outperformed more cyclical portions of the equity market for five years running \u2013 putting value stocks at a record-wide valuation discount to growth stocks. Many equity market participants have capitalized on these trends, to their benefit, while the broader market has become increasingly narrow. Investors, by human nature, are keen to stick with their current paths, even when risks suggest potentially better expected outcomes elsewhere \u2013 a phenomenon behavioral theorists call status quo bias. Adding some value equity to client portfolios as a diversification hedge against other more correlated assets may be an easier first step for some, but we believe it will ultimately be the path to building better outcomes for clients of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. Our Approach to Investing Is Finding Opportunity in Today\u2019s Fast-Changing Markets \u2026 The continuously changing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has embedded itself into the perceived outlook and performance of more cyclical equities relative to large-cap growth leaders. The short-term volatility experienced in this environment creates excellent values for astute longer-term investors looking to help mitigate risk in their portfolios. Our Opportunistic Value approach is intentionally designed to take advantage of these environments by building concentrated exposure in a portfolio of companies that we believe will generate alpha for clients through the cycle. \u00d7 \" We believe that adding value equity to client portfolios as a diversification hedge against other more correlated assets may ultimately be the path to building better outcomes. Our team believes there is more at stake in the current environment than simply a short-term normalization of the economy. Interest rates have been on a multi-decade downward trajectory owing to globalization and a technology-fueled productivity boom. Although these trends should continue, the pace is likely to slow prospectively. Competition for a more mobile - and virtual - workforce is heating up labor rates. Large low-cost labor forces are disappearing globally with modernization in countries such as China. The reshoring of U.S. supply chains is also very likely to have a lasting impact, alongside a near decade of underinvestment in the world\u2019s natural resource stock. The key point is that the status quo bias inherently ignores the potential generational shift of future inflation, the drivers behind it and the wide-reaching impacts of higher interest rates across the yield curve. We believe this creates ample opportunity for alpha generation. \u2026 Which We Aim to Capitalize on Through Our Time-Tested Investing Philosophy and Process Our philosophy targets strategically advantaged companies with high investment returns and strong cash flow generation. We look to invest in the stocks of these companies when they are out of favor or misunderstood by the broader market (and, therefore, trading at a discount to intrinsic value) \u2013 an approach we refer to as Opportunistic Value investing. We leverage our dedicated team of equity analysts, with an average of over two decades of experience, to find these opportunistic values. When we do find them, we invest with conviction, and we utilize a series of team disciplines to fight complacency and remain on an opportunistic footing for our clients. \u00d7 1 Diversification does not eliminate the risk of future loss 2 The index performance is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. See Disclosure section for index definitions \u00d7 RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective.

Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-and medium-capitalization companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. The impact of the coronavirus on global markets could last for an extended period and could adversely affect the Fund\u2019s performance. \u00d7 Aaron Dunn Managing Director Co-Head and Portfolio ManagerValue Equities \u00d7 Brad Galko Managing DirectorCo-Head and Portfolio ManagerValue Equities \u00d7", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/seizing-opportunity-with-value-equity-in-2022.html"}
{"content": "2021 marked the most rapid economic recovery witnessed in the U.S. over the past four decades. As a result, inflation has reached its highest point since the 1970s and markets are polarized between the need to raise rates to curb price growth versus continuing to stimulate the economy to achieve and sustain full employment. In the meantime, real estate fundamentals have accelerated beyond expectation, with 20% rent growth common in many U.S. apartment and industrial markets and cap rates at record low levels. Consequently, returns in 2021 are likely to be at the highest point since 2010. While Europe\u2019s recovery has lagged and Asia\u2019s has been more stop-start, real estate fundamentals have exhibited strength, and the weight of capital looking for durable income has kept yields low. \u00d7 Within 18 months, the global economy has already reached the mid-phase of a typical economic cycle. From here, MS Research forecasts a moderation in economic growth and tighter monetary policy, with significant variation around the world, linked to COVID variants and vaccination progress, government policy, divergent growth drivers and geopolitical risks. Real estate fundamentals will follow suit, with moderating but above-trend near-term rent growth and the likelihood of flat to marginally higher cap rates in some markets and sectors as growth expectations moderate. The structural impacts from COVID-19 will also continue to influence the amount and type of real estate sought by occupiers. While uncertainty and occupancy challenges were dominant themes in 2021, it is likely that more permanent impacts may emerge in terms of space usage, desired asset specifications and preferred locational attributes within each sector in 2022 and 2023. GDP Growth Expected to Remain Strong, but Decelerating as Economy Shifts to Mid-Cycle Phase Following a robust global growth rate of 6.1% in 2021, Morgan Stanley (MS) Research expects growth to step down to 4.7% in 2022. U.S. growth is expected to stay strong, at 4.6% in 2022, slightly down from 5.5% in 2021, supported by deferred consumption, inventory rebuilding and lack of fiscal drag. Growth in Europe and the U.K. is expected to remain robust and balanced and match the U.S. at 4.6% in 2022, supported by a solid labor market and accomodative policy. From 2023, U.S. growth is expected to outpace other developed markets, in-line with pre-COVID trends. In China, MS Research expects policy to reverse the recent sharp slowing, but still forecasts medium-term growth below pre-COVID rates. Japan is expected to continue its path toward economic normalization, generating above-trend growth of 2.9% in 2022. This growth is expected to be supported by an increase in Japan\u2019s exports of capital goods, IT-related items and autos as well as a gradual return of personal spending from higher vaccination rates. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Slower but Above Trend Growth Forecast \uf065 Source: MS Research, Strategy, data as of November 16, 2021 \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Slower but Above Trend Growth Forecast Source: MS Research, Strategy, data as of November 16, 2021 Labor Supply Constraints: Mostly a U.S. Concern Labor market frictions are a key theme, with reported shortages most acute in the U.S. Despite strong labor demand and rising wages, labor force participation remains 170bps below its pre-COVID level. However, prime-age labor force participation rates are expected to increase by 40bps in 2022 and another 30bps in 2023, helped by improving child care, falling health risks and rising wages. In contrast, in the euro area the labor market has weathered the pandemic reasonably well, with the labor force participation at the end of 2Q just 0.7pp below its pre-COVID level due to successful furlough schemes. In the UK, the participation rate stands at 100bps below its 1Q20 highs, worse than in the euro area but better than the U.S. Inflation is forecasted to stay high through 2022 Inflation prints have reached record levels in the U.S. and Europe prompting a shift in Fed policy. While inflation is forecast to stay high through most of 2022, it is expected to moderate thereafter. This forecasted moderation is due to a shift in consumer spending from goods to less inflationary services, easing supply chain bottlenecks and a retreat in energy prices. In the U.S., the price effects of supply chain disruptions are expected to subside over the coming quarters, with continued higher rents and wages countering these deflationary factors, which is expected to keep overall inflation at higher levels than pre-COVID through 2023. Overall MS research forecasts 2022 inflation prints of 3% in the U.S., 2.3% in the U.K., 1.4% in Europe and 1.2% in Japan (4Q \u201822 over 4Q \u201821). \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: Inflation Expected to Stay Elevated in 2022 \uf065 Source: Morgan Stanley Research, data as of November 2021 \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: Inflation Expected to Stay Elevated in 2022 Source: Morgan Stanley Research, data as of November 2021 DISPLAY 3: Transaction Activity Extending Beyond Industrial and \uf065 Source: Real Capital Analytics, MSREI Strategy, data as of September 2021 \u00d7 DISPLAY 3: Transaction Activity Extending Beyond Industrial and Source: Real Capital Analytics, MSREI Strategy, data as of September 2021 Tightening Central Bank Policy In line with the midcycle economic environment and due to more persistent inflationary pressures, monetary policy is expected to normalize and tighten. The Federal Reserve has accelerated its tapering of asset purchases with the program expected to end by March 2022. Additionally, the Fed has projected three 25bps rate hikes in 2022, another three in 2023 and two more in 2024. The Bank of England and Bank of Canada are also poised to raise interest rates in the near term. The U.S. yield curve has begun to steepen, with long-term rates hitting 1.74% (as at January 6, 2022), and MS Research expects them to continue to rise and reach 2.1% in 4Q22, resulting in a flatter curve going into 2023, given higher policy rates. The most prominent risk to Morgan Stanley\u2019s overall constructive forecast (+40bps above consensus) are continued supply chain pressures (including both goods and labor) and the rise in number and severity of cases from the new omicron COVID variant. The supply constraints that have held back growth and pushed up inflation in 2021 could easily persist or worsen. In such a scenario, growth would be notably weaker, inflation higher and policy rates aggressively tighter. Given relatively high and accelerating vaccination rates and a \u201clive with COVID\u201d stance adopted by most countries, the risk of new broad-based lockdowns and consequent significant loss of economic activity is expected to be relatively low. \u00d7 DISPLAY 4: Short- and Long-Term Interest Rates \uf065 Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Morgan Stanley Research, data as of December 2021 \u00d7 DISPLAY 4: Short- and Long-Term Interest Rates Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Morgan Stanley Research, data as of December 2021 Shrinking Real Estate Investable Universe Will Increase Competition for Core Assets Given the low interest rate environment, the weight of capital targeting real estate will likely continue to increase as investors search for yield. While the industrial, residential and healthcare sectors are taking the lion\u2019s share of allocated capital, core offices and niche sectors like student/senior living are beginning to garner more investor interest despite facing occupancy challenges in 2021. At the same time, there continues to be less investor appetite for retail, noncore office and business-related hotels. \u00d7 Price Acceleration Industrial and residential prices have accelerated rapidly, in part due to cap rate compression driven by outsized investor interest, but also due to significant rent growth, most notably in the U.S. Outside of London, Europe\u2019s industrial price acceleration has been largely driven by cap rate compression. While rent growth has not kept pace, it is expected to catch up over the coming years. In Asia, prices and rents have grown more modestly, suggesting some potential upside to values. On the other end of the spectrum is office, which has seen considerably less price growth and even more divergence across regions. For example office markets in Germany have still seen cap rate compression while gateway cities in the U.S. have seen yields expand, particularly for non-stabilized assets due to greater uncertainty over future demand given likely higher adoption of work-from-home models. \u00d7 DISPLAY 5: Price Growth \uf065 Source: Green Street Advisors, PMA, MSREI Strategy, data as of October 2021 \u00d7 DISPLAY 5: Price Growth Source: Green Street Advisors, PMA, MSREI Strategy, data as of October 2021 Fundamentals may converge across sectors but remain bifurcated across markets Across all regions, property market fundamentals have been impacted by the pandemic to differing degrees. The industrial sector continues to exhibit the strongest performance globally, spurred by tenant demand driven by an acceleration in e-commerce and supply chain reconfiguration. Residential sector fundamentals have surged, given supply shortages, higher incomes and for-sale affordability challenges. While fundamentals in these two sectors have been propelled by structural changes from COVID-19, it is expected that fundamentals will moderate due to higher supply and a pullback in space demand from industrial tenants and lower multifamily demand, given rent affordability challenges. While uncertainty and occupancy challenges plagued the office sector in 2021, higher utilization rates are expected in 2022. However, as employees\u2019 work preferences shift from being health-driven to lifestyle-driven, it is expected that hybrid work models could become the norm, leading to a reduction in overall office demand of 10%-15% with significant variation across region, and asset location and specifications. Fundamentals have also begun to improve for sub types of retail and hotel assets, most notably Class A malls and leisure-oriented hotels. \u00d7 Industrial SIGNIFICANT ACCELERATION IN PRICING, DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY MOST ATTRACTIVE Operating Fundamentals The industrial sector continues to see more yield compression than other sectors, driven by outsized investor demand, given the strong growth outlook. Higher e-commerce penetration, supply chain diversification and inventory restocking is expected to continue to support significant incremental demand for well-located logistics assets. Inventory shortages resulting in supply chain reorientation is expected to continue to shift demand to new markets, e.g., Vietnam, India, Mexico. Additionally, supply chain bottlenecks have led to shipping and port delays and shifted incremental demand to inland port and more rail- dependent locations. Significant divergence in market rent growth globally, the U.S. and the UK leading the way. Market is beginning to homogenize \u2013 similar cap rates across markets (both primary and secondary) despite different outlooks and exposure to supply risk. \u00d7 DISPLAY 6: Historically Tight Vacancy in U.S. and Europe \uf065 Source: JLL, MSREI Strategy, as of October 2021 \u00d7 DISPLAY 6: Historically Tight Vacancy in U.S. and Europe Source: JLL, MSREI Strategy, as of October 2021 DISPLAY 7: Low Yields Reflect Continued High Rent Growth Expectations \uf065 Source: CBRE, BNP Paribas, JLL, MSREI Strategy, data as of October 2021. \u00d7 DISPLAY 7: Low Yields Reflect Continued High Rent Growth Expectations Source: CBRE, BNP Paribas, JLL, MSREI Strategy, data as of October 2021.

Europe: Target development opportunities that are at an attractive basis in highest-growth markets in locations with favorable demand/ supply balance, e.g., London submarkets. Asia: Target development opportunities for smaller-scale warehouses in infill locations within Japan. Continue to grow industrial platform in key distribution hubs in India and China. \u00d7 Residential SURGE IN FUNDAMENTALS IS EXPECTED TO MODERATE AS DEMAND/SUPPLY REBALANCE Operating Fundamentals Supply shortages continue to exist at more affordable price points in many global markets. Significant market rent growth in the U.S. is challenging rent affordability and, therefore, sustainability of future rent growth. Supply expected to catch up in many markets, returning housing markets to equilibrium. Low cap rates reflect loss to lease in many markets (market rent above in-place rent). Regulatory risk limiting rental growth in select markets where affordability is stretched. \u00d7 DISPLAY 8: Low Yields Reflect High Loss to Lease Rates \uf065 Source: Census Bureau, Moody\u2019s Analytics, MSREI Strategy, data as of October 2021 \u00d7 DISPLAY 8: Low Yields Reflect High Loss to Lease Rates Source: Census Bureau, Moody\u2019s Analytics, MSREI Strategy, data as of October 2021 DISPLAY 9: Rent Growth Normalizing \uf065 Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Moody\u2019s Analytics, MSREI Strategy, as of November 2021 \u00d7 DISPLAY 9: Rent Growth Normalizing Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Moody\u2019s Analytics, MSREI Strategy, as of November 2021 Investment Strategies U.S.: Reposition Class A-/B+ assets at more attractive basis and position for jobs and rent recovery in major residential markets and develop single-family rental product to address housing shortages in Sun Belt locations benefiting from shifting demographic trends. Europe: Leverage asset management expertise to reposition/refurbish slightly older assets and drive rental growth in higher-growth markets, e.g., Finland. Asia: Target development/forward purchase opportunities in Japan and continue to evaluate opportunities in emerging for-rent markets, e.g., Australia. \u00d7 Office SIGNIFICANT BIFURCATION IN PERFORMANCE Operating Fundamentals Impact of increased work from home on offices continues to be a major discussion item, with significant variation around the world due to health and lifestyle choices. Overall, expect to see lower demand and wide dispersion in performance among markets and asset quality levels. The performance is expected to widen between commodity product exposed to functional obsolescence and huge capex needs and modern, differentiated product in stronger markets.

Europe: Reposition office assets meeting demands of modern occupiers that are at attractive basis and defensive rent level. Asia: Target stable, high-yielding assets in core Asian markets where moderate leverage can generate an attractive cash-on-cash yield. \u00d7 Hotels FROM REPRICED ALPHA BET TO GROWTH-ORIENTED BETA PLAY Operating Fundamentals Leisure hotel fundamentals have recovered far more quickly than we would have anticipated in the U.S. and are now at/ahead of 2019 levels. The recovery has lagged for hotels outside the U.S. and business hotels relying on conferences or international travel. Investment Strategies Acquire prime hotel assets that may have operating challenges and impaired cash flows that will likely see an accelerated recovery back to pre-COVID RevPAR following the resumption of tourism and business travel. \u00d7 Niche Sectors Garnering More Interest Operating Fundamentals Overall increase in investor interest and allocations to niche sectors. Healthcare continues to perform well. Life science fundamentals remain extremely strong, with vacancy rates near zero in prominent clusters, attracting capital and keeping yields at record-low levels. New development and office-to-lab conversions are increasing supply levels. Student housing offers an attractive yield spread to multifamily, stable and countercyclical demand that has rebounded to 2019 levels in major markets and reduced supply levels versus pre-COVID trends. Senior living fundamentals have rebounded as vaccination rates for the 75+ group accelerates. Supply is also lower compared with pre-COVID levels, and yields are relatively higher than other healthcare sectors, given sector re-pricing. \u00d7 DISPLAY 12: Life Science Yields Continue to Compress in-line with Strong Rent Growth \uf065 Source: Costar; Bidwells, MSREI Strategy, as of May 2021 \u00d7 DISPLAY 12: Life Science Yields Continue to Compress in-line with Strong Rent Growth Source: Costar; Bidwells, MSREI Strategy, as of May 2021 Investment Strategies Reposition healthcare assets including life science and medical office at attractive yields on cost in markets with an institutional healthcare sector (e.g., U.S., UK) Evaluate opportunities to partner with strong operators to acquire repriced senior housing assets supported by favorable secular demand drivers and lower levels of new supply, (e.g., U.S.). Evaluate opportunities to partner with skilled operators to develop/enhance student housing assets proximate to strong university campuses (e.g., U.S., Europe). \u00d7 Retail RETAIL SECTOR BEGINNING TO RECOVER Operating Fundamentals Lack of investor interest and challenging fundamentals has increased yield spread over other sectors Leasing activity has been strong in 2H \u201821, despite health concerns, particularly for class A malls More bifurcation in performances as retailers re-orient their locations and footprints to drive more efficiencies \u00d7 DISPLAY 13: The Decline in Retail Transaction Volume Share Appears to be Bottoming \uf065 Source: RCA, MSREI Strategy, data as of October 2021 \u00d7 DISPLAY 13: The Decline in Retail Transaction Volume Share Appears to be Bottoming Source: RCA, MSREI Strategy, data as of October 2021 DISPLAY 14: Retail Spread over Industrial Cap Rates Significantly Expanded in U.S., UK \uf065 Source: Greenstreet, PMA, MSREI Strategy \u00d7 DISPLAY 14: Retail Spread over Industrial Cap Rates Significantly Expanded in U.S., UK Source: Greenstreet, PMA, MSREI Strategy Investment Strategies Selectively consider re-priced high street assets at reset rent levels that may benefit from increasing tourism demand \u00d7 ESG considerations remain top-of-mind Investment managers need to remain focused on managing the environmental footprint of real estate assets they acquire and manage to reduce negative environmental impacts while maximizing efficiency and value to investors, tenants and the broader community. Initiatives focused on building safety, existing contamination, energy supply and efficiency, flooding, GHG emissions, indoor environmental air quality, natural hazards, water supply and water efficiency need to be continually monitored and addressed. These ESG considerations are now being fully integrated into investment decisions, underwriting, asset management and hold/sell decisions. Additionally, MSREI believes that there will be opportunities to reposition existing assets to better align to higher ESG standards. \u00d7 DISPLAY 15: Market Environment Summary \uf065 \u00d7 DISPLAY 15: Market Environment Summary Conclusion Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing (MSREI) believes that the global real estate environment will support attractive real estate returns for value-add/ opportunistic investments over the next several years, driven by outsized rental growth in some sectors (e.g., industrial, residential), cap rate compression (supported by low interest rates) and some moderate levels of re-pricing (e.g., in sectors more negatively impacted by COVID). In this investing environment, MSREI believes local market perspective, knowledge, presence and relationships, combined with the ability to actively manage assets to drive NOI growth will be critical to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns. \u00d7 Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing (MSREI) manages global value-add /opportunistic and regional core real estate investment strategies.

{"content": "When we talked about sustainability themes 18 months ago, climate and the environment tended to dominate as the key systemic and idiosyncratic risk to all issuers and corporates in both private and public markets. So much has changed since then. Along with the pandemic we endured, growing social awareness of critical issues like diversity, equity and inclusion have come to the forefront of public consciousness. \u00d7 What we see now in the markets are essentially push and pull factors driving the evolution of sustainability as part of the investment process, with the aim to optimize particular outcomes. The push factor is the growing scrutiny from regulators in the US, Europe and Asia. The pull factor comes from clients who are increasingly looking for ways to gain greater transparency and influence with their capital. Identifying four key themes linked to UN Sustainable Development Goals At Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM), we have adapted our analysis and scrutiny to focus on four key themes linked to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)1 that we think are material from an investment perspective. Climate continues to be relevant, as well as pollution prevention, waste control and the circular economy. We would all agree that these themes matter, not just from the risk perspective of managing downside \u2014 particularly companies\u2019 exposure to carbon prices or fossil fuels \u2014 but also the potential opportunity to help drive the clean energy transition. So both risk and opportunity are related to those themes. \u00d7 \uf065 \u00d7 Thinking first about decent work and resilient jobs, we believe that as we move into the global economy\u2019s phase of recovery and growth, a company\u2019s ability to succeed is going to rely on having a productive, healthy and educated workforce. At the same time, the nature of work is evolving, with recent surveys illustrating that employees have reassessed their goals and priorities over the past 18 months. So it has become even more important for firms to engage with workers to make sure that they are not only safe but also motivated, equipped and skilled in their roles. In our view, those companies that have invested in their people are best placed to benefit as the economy recovers.2 Turning to inclusive business practices, academic research has illustrated that a diverse workforce helps to avoid everyone coming from homogenous backgrounds and thinking the same way. Alternative perspectives and insights are invaluable along the investment process, from security research to client communication. That has always been true. Also relevant for us is reflecting on movements like Black Lives Matter, which are raising our awareness that the effects of events like pandemics are falling disproportionally on the most vulnerable and marginalized elements of the population. When we evaluate companies to invest in, we need to consider whether they have done their part to make products and services more accessible to those less privileged, and to help their brands resonate with a more diverse community. That can be powerful for fostering customer loyalty and keeping the brand profile aligned with the current state of public consciousness. Building sustainability factors into our investment practice We live with competing and critical challenges. Our private equity clients are looking for good long-term premium returns associated with private investing. The question whether climate investing can generate returns has been answered affirmatively. What we now need to ask is how can we afford to avoid climate investing or climate loans if we are investing for the long term? We know the size of the problem: to cut our carbon emissions by 40 gigatons each year from now until 2050 to reach the goal of carbon neutrality. That is the bad news. But here is the good news: Investing for climate impact is intrinsic to compelling private equity outcomes across four dimensions. First, company managements recognize that efficiently using raw materials and other inputs into the production process directly impacts the bottom line. We could say that improving EBITDA margins is private equity 101, so aligning with environmental objectives can be quite intuitive. Second, sustainability is a growth area. Consumers are willing to pay more to eat sustainable food, wear sustainable clothes, drive sustainable vehicles and live in sustainable housing. These are all exciting markets and revenue streams for older traditional companies to pivot towards for future growth \u2014 often by acquiring newer companies focused on sustainability. Third, building climate resilience into business models becomes imperative as frequent extreme weather events pose threats to supply chains. Infrastructure needs to last for the 8- to 10-year investment periods of the private funds we offer. Managing operational risk through secure locations and backup plans can improve cash flow predictability. Tying together the dimensions of margins, growth and resilience, we find the answer to our question in the markets. In our experience, private companies with concrete sustainability stories tend to capture the so-called gradient when they list in the public equity markets. Or traditional companies acquire them for the same reason. Leveling the playing field in early-stage funding Through the lens of our clients at Morgan Stanley \u2014 that pull factor \u2013 we see a real desire to be part of the solution around the funding inequity in private markets \u2014 especially for early-stage companies. According to Crunchbase, only 2% of early-stage dollars are earmarked for founders of color and women, perpetuating the inequality that pushes into middle-market private equity and ultimately the companies that file IPOs and exit the market.3 Our surveys reveal that 75% of our VCs (venture capitalists) strongly agree that an investment strategy can intentionally invest in women and founders of color, while still maximizing returns.4 So investors are coming to understand that they are not required to sacrifice returns for diversity in their portfolios. Diversity really plays into the ability to fund direct investments that can actually outpace the benchmarks, even in early-stage companies. So we do observe that push and pull where LPs (limited partners) say, \u201cWe want to see diverse founders in VC portfolios.\u201d And VCs say, \u201cWe want to find diverse founders,\u201d and then go to their sources to open their own networks to those founders. We also hear LPs say, \u201cWe want to put more capital into emerging managers and funds of color.\u201d The objective is to tackle social issues while investing in companies that are inherently more sustainable, because they find solutions to problems affecting their communities. Bottom line Across the spectrum of private investing \u2014 from early-stage funding to deal sourcing to public offering \u2014 we see the role of sustainability as ever-increasing. Governmental supervision and legislation push us to factor ESG metrics into our investment analysis, while our clients pull us forward to take their preferences and objectives into account. Relative to the public markets, private markets give investors the ability to require these outcomes and let them track the impact their money is creating. After all, this is just good private markets investing, and we are headed in that direction. \u00d7 1 This represents how the portfolio management team generally implements its investment process under normal market conditions.

{"content": "December 2021 was dominated by three events: the spread of Omicron; the US Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement on the likely future path of tapering and rate hikes; and a setback to US President Biden\u2019s Build Back Better fiscal bill. The first half of December saw markets recover from November\u2019s COVID-induced sell-off. However, the exponential spread of this new variant across the globe prompted a further sell-off in mid-December, only to rally as we approached year end. \u00d7 Despite a choppy December, all three major developed markets closed the month up, with the S&amp;P 500 (USD) at 4.5%, the MSCI Europe Index (EUR) returning 5.5% and the MSCI Japan Index (JPY) 3.4%1. The US remained the clear outperformer for 2021, returning 28.7%2. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index (USD) suffered under the threat of Omicron, returning 1.9% on the month.1 Having spiked in late November-early December \u2013 at 1 December, the VIX stood at 313- volatility was relatively subdued for most of December, ending the year at a level of 17.4 FOMC announcement removes some uncertainty The Fed delivered what markets expected - doubling the speed of tapering from mid-January 2022 and projecting three rate hikes in 2022, with three more in 20235. The Fed appears to have finally caught up with markets. With the announcement helping to remove some uncertainty around Fed actions, markets rallied on the day. Our base case for the rate hike path is now in line with Fed projections for 2022/2023, and slightly more optimistic than the market on the terminal rate reached for this cycle, as we expect two more hikes in the 2024/2025 period. This hiking path would imply (absent any term premium) a US 10-Year Treasury at 1.876 by end of 2022. Build Back Better suffers a heavy blow US President Biden\u2019s Build Back Better bill is a cornerstone of his COVID relief, social welfare and climate agenda. The rejection of the bill by Democratic Senator Manchin was therefore a heavy blow to Biden, as he requires the support of all 50 Senate Democrats to bring it into law. There is still hope that the fiscal bill will pass in one form or another \u2013 indeed, markets are still expecting some fiscal support \u2013 but it will likely be smaller than the proposed $1.75 trillion, in turn potentially lowering US GDP forecasts. However, there could also be some positives from this, as it lowers the likelihood of tax increases, while reduced fiscal stimulus could dampen rising inflation, which has been exacerbated by COVID supply-side dynamics. In November, US headline CPI rose an astounding 6.8% YoY7, the highest in 39 years. Investment Implications In the days after the Fed announcement, markets welcomed clarity from the Fed. We did not make any changes to our equity positioning or tactical changes during the month. As we enter 2022, we are prudently positioned. We believe that equities should continue to outperform fixed income. Whilst we may not see the same surge in equities that we saw throughout 2021, we still expect to see moderately positive equity performance, as the healthy growth outlook should remain. However, high valuations and the potential for multiple compression for equities in the face of interest rate rises remain a concern. Whilst we have tilted towards value for much of 2021, as we look forward to 2022 we anticipate a favourable environment for quality growth stocks, which tend to outperform mid-cycle. We maintain an underweight to duration considering the outlook for rates. Tactical positioning We have provided our tactical views below: \u00d7 \uf065 Source: MSIM GBaR team, as of 31 December 2021.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser\u2019s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio\u2019s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio\u2019s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. \u00d7 Andrew Harmstone Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Manfred Hui Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Select Product(s) Right Click Edit", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/three-events-and-a-rally.html"}
{"content": "2021 has turned out to be another year of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin (~+97%), Ethereum (~+527%), and the now infamous Dogecoin (~+4,486%) have all dramatically outperformed the S&amp;P 500 (+22%).1 \u00d7 In August 2008, in the midst of the Global Financial Crisis, a nine-page paper titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was published under a pseudonym on a cryptography mailing list. Two years later, Laszlo Hanyecz offered 10,000 bitcoins in exchange for two pizzas, the first recognised commercial transaction on this new payment concept. Thirteen years on, Bitcoin still exists, functioning as a network to move value on the internet without the use of a central authority\u2014even if Bitcoin itself has become more of a speculative asset than a stable substitute for money. Today, those 10,000 bitcoins are worth ~US$470 million and cryptocurrency system tokens have a total market capitalisation of around US$3 trillion.2 \u00d7 \" Today, cryptocurrency system tokens have a total market capitalisation of around US$3 trillion Last month the first a bitcoin-linked exchange traded fund (ETF) was finally launched, becoming the fastest ever ETF to reach US$1 billion of assets.3 An ETF which directly owns Bitcoin (rather than Bitcoin futures) still awaits approval from the U.S. regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Blockchain \u2013 the underlying technology Bitcoin is underpinned by blockchain. For many, blockchain is a difficult field to get comfortable with because it sits somewhere between economics, cryptography/database construction, theoretical statistics, and sometimes even philosophy\u2014 academic disciplines of which few people have a combined understanding. It is also surrounded by a huge amount of noise from fringe libertarian followers, and the system is rife with hype from fraudsters. Whilst blockchain was initially a consumer-led innovation, dismissed by professional investors and regulators, a recently renamed social media company\u2019s 2019 digital currency project was a turning point; the potential of a well-funded company with over a billion users to create a more or less instantly scaled, systemically important private currency was a wake-up call. Without getting into how blockchains work, the key concept is that they are a new type of database architecture with the potential to disintermediate many existing business models, particularly, but not exclusively, in financial services. This new database structure facilitates the transfer of value between parties over the internet without a central authority. It also allows for the creation of automatically-executing \u2018smart\u2019 contracts and programmable money\u2014which we explain later. Its presence and properties could theoretically lower the costs of verification and network construction in the economy. In more tangible terms, today when you use digital money on a debit or credit card to buy something, banks and payment networks extract fees for verifying you are good for the money you are giving to the merchant in exchange for a particular product or service. Verification costs are even higher when multiple parties need to verify/audit the transfer of assets through a chain of correspondent bank ledgers across borders. This is the reason cross-border remittances are slow and costly. Blockchain technology could enable such transfers more quickly and cheaply, in ways that are more easily auditable by all parties involved. Blockchain database structures allow for one central \u201csource of truth\u201d, a ledger, to be distributed across many parties that can store a copy of it, access it and add to it. Blockchain also has the theoretical ability to lower the barriers to entry to building a new network. If you wanted to build a new centralised payment network today, it would entail very high startup technology and security costs. Blockchain networks can be built up over time far more cheaply, using incentives for users, investors and developers, with both the security and the value of the network itself scaling as the network grows. We believe that this innovation in verification and in networking economics has implications for the long-term outlook of moats around the returns of some quality companies and how they do business today. Opportunities posed by blockchain We believe that the properties of blockchain can pressure existing industries to become higher quality and can also allow the creation of new quality businesses, which centralised system economics have so far failed to achieve. Pressure from blockchain on incumbents could alter current competitive industry dynamics and encourage co-operation among natural competitors\u2014or \u2018co-opetition\u2019. A good example is supply chain finance, a US$16 trillion industry4 with an all-too-common reliance on archaic paper forms and stamps.5 Blockchain competition is encouraging banks, commodity firms and shippers to group together, standardise and digitise their processes in ways that previously proved elusive. Thus paper methods move to digital, saving significant operational costs, increasing efficiencies and speed and also releasing collateral capital from the system. The most bullish estimates suggest this could free up over US$1 trillion of cost from the system.6 Whilst blockchain networks are ideally suited to large multi-party networks with significant agreements to move ownership rights, the eventual solution may not be a new, decentralised blockchain company. It may actually be preferable simply to upgrade incumbent systems on existing centralised databases using apps, or to use a more centralised permissioned blockchain\u2014which isn\u2019t that different to the systems that exist today. Either way, the presence of blockchain is forcing progress. Without the existential threat it poses, many industry incumbents lack the impetus to change (inevitably in many instances the threat may not be enough). There are opportunities not just around systems that already exist; there are many new ideas and functions which could become very high return businesses of the future\u2014for instance a blockchain network allowing customers to buy art or real estate, thus replacing complex auction and legal fees. Continuing the supply chain theme, blockchain experimentation is leading to innovation in tracking the provenance of goods. This could significantly reduce waste. While not a decentralised blockchain system like bitcoin, an American multinational retail corporation is experimenting with blockchain company Hyperledger Fabric to bring greater transparency to food supply chains. This could enable highly selective recalls of specific batches of contaminated foods, such as E. coli infected food, eliminating the huge wastage that occurs in indiscriminate recalls when contamination is detected today. Cryptocurrencies and the central banks Pressure to change even extends to central banks. Today, consumers have two main forms of money: cash directly issued by central banks in a physical bearer form, and account-based money inside the banking system. We believe that Bitcoin has proven the concept of a new form of peer-to-peer value, a private form of currency in the form of a digital bearer asset, with a pre-programmed monetary policy. Whilst private currencies are not a new invention, digital private currencies have the potential to scale up and provide a decentralised check. Furthermore digital programmable bearer assets represent many new opportunities. They can increase the safety of the payment system. Historically, cash was a reasonable alternative to account-based digital money. However, as the use of cash declines, and the systemic dependence on the private companies operating payment systems risks single points of failure, what happens if any major card network gets hacked, or simply breaks? If a central bank could issue tokenised digital cash, they could create a viable alternative digital payment system. Central bank issued tokens could also have additional features which are not present in the system today. For instance, they could automatically be linked to central bank interest rates, positive or negative. This is particularly interesting for negative rates, whose real efficacy today is more constrained by the presence of physical cash. Singapore, Canada, China and Sweden have all been testing some advanced digital currency programs.7 One of our portfolio companies runs the E-krona project for the Bank of Sweden. Token offerings Outside creating new digital bearer forms of cash, tokens can be structured in many ways, both fungible and non-fungible. Some are designed as revenue utility tokens\u2014think of them like a token which represents a single use of an arcade game or laundromat machine. Some are structured more like equity, giving theoretical rights over fee pools and profits. Other tokens are digital representations of assets, from stable coins which are fungible and represent fiat currency, to NFTs (non-fungible tokens) which represent ownership over digital art for instance, but could also represent physical art, or even your home. The customisable nature of tokens opens up all sorts of other parts of finance and asset transfer. Tokens are also another way to bring liquidity to fund businesses. You may have heard about ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings). As a structure, they have the potential to turn private venture capital funding or expensive initial public offering processes from being local and closed, to global and open to everyone. Asset tokenisation can extend far beyond financial services; theoretically the Mona Lisa could be turned into a token and ownership of the painting could become far more accessible and liquid. Owners of a Mona Lisa token could attain rights over ticket revenue to view the Mona Lisa. In the coming decades, it isn\u2019t beyond the realms of possibility that something akin to a Mona Lisa token could form part of a future global equity strategy designed around strong franchises. Already investing In the meantime, why is all of this of interest? Many of our team\u2019s existing holdings are already investing in blockchain and are creating new services to profit from blockchain. For example, a multinational professional services company has already been mentioned as a key partner with the Swedish central bank, the Riksbank. One of the world\u2019s largest software companies runs one of the largest blockchain-as-a-service (BAAS) products on its Azure platform, enabling its clients to deploy blockchain networks, build apps with confidence and store data off-chain. A multinational IT services company similarly has a BAAS offering integrated with its cloud product Leonardo. An American technology conglomerate is creating a search engine for blockchain and has partnered with Chainlink, a blockchain platform which provides data signals, or oracles, from the real world for smart contracts. A global payments company is instrumental in enabling fiat currency to crypto payments, and it is pursuing a large amount of experimentation and investment in blockchain, including investment in Anchorage Digital, one of the leading custody providers in crypto. A Singaporean financial services corporation is part of the eTrade Connect consortium to modernise trade finance using Hyperledger. At this stage these exposures are not material\u2014but could be very material on a 10-year view. Problem-solving potential We are still very early in the advent of the \u2018Internet of Value\u2019. Most concepts to date do not work properly at scale outside of highly controlled experimental environments. Blockchain is going to have to prove that it can solve real problems in an economically viable way. The list of problems to overcome is long. It includes scalability, speed, privacy, security, environmental impact/energy intensity, governance, and more. Know Your Client, anti-money laundering, general data protection regulation (GDPR) and investor protection issues are all being considered by regulators, but approaches vary between getting blockchain organisations to fit into existing financial services registrations and creating new frameworks. One common area of global focus has been on the stock exchanges as they interface with the existing financial system. Ultimately, the cryptokitty is now out of the bag and there probably isn\u2019t any going back. Shoot for the moon? It is very hard to say what the future looks like, but if we were to hazard a guess, where centralised, scalable systems work well in the main\u2014like a global payments company\u2019s platform which processes approximately 2,000 transactions a second\u2014blockchain is more likely to encourage innovation by incumbents and disintermediate the pricing in some of the functional layers these businesses undertake today. In these instances, there often isn\u2019t a massive problem to fix, but rather a series of things to improve. However, where incumbents have so far resisted change and sleepy, paper-based value transfer is the norm, new blockchain companies may well completely replace existing ways of verifying asset transfer. In the meantime, one of the biggest obstacles immediately ahead is regulation, but once there is a framework for how blockchain fits into public policy, institutional adoption will likely be further enabled, and progress should re-accelerate. Many prominent investors and economists are contemptuous of cryptocurrency. Dogecoin may turn out to be tulip mania, or maybe, as the official Dogecoin song8 goes: \u2018To the Moon!\u2019, the HODL (Hold On for Dear Life) Doge Army is rightly throwing down the gauntlet to all of us to be more imaginative about what the future could look like. \u00d7 1 https://coinmarketcap.com/ 2 https://coinmarketcap.com/ 3 https://medium.com/blockdata/blockchain-closing-the-1-5-trillion-gap-in-trade-finance-8a3f8ce912a4 4 https://coinmarketcap.com/ 5 https://medium.com/blockdata/blockchain-closing-the-1-5-trillion-gap-in-trade-finance-8a3f8ce912a4 6 https://medium.com/blockdata/blockchain-closing-the-1-5-trillion-gap-in-trade-finance-8a3f8ce912a4 7 https://medium.com/blockdata/blockchain-closing-the-1-5-trillion-gap-in-trade-finance-8a3f8ce912a4 8 Dogecoin Song - To the Moon [Official] \u00d7 Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy\u2019s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. Cryptocurrency (notably, Bitcoin) operates as a decentralised, peer-to-peer financial exchange and value storage that is used like money. It is not backed by any government. Federal, state or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency may experience very high volatility. \u00d7 Alex Gabriele Managing Director International Equity Team Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/to-the-moon-quality-investing-and-blockchain.html"}
{"content": "Our base case is that COVID-19 will transition from pandemic to endemic in 2022, with 2023 likely the first full normal year since 2019. Two years after the first cases of COVID-19, the world still faces tsunamis of new infections with no apparent end in sight. And while COVID-19 continues to have an outsized impact on financial assets\u2014for example, bond market performance in the past nine months has been better explained by infection numbers than inflation, growth, or the Fed\u2014countries, populations and governments are reacting more moderately to new waves of infections, with targeted measures such as vaccination campaigns and mandates, with masking and selective quarantines thus reducing the economic impacts of each successive wave. Indeed, current data suggests omicron is twice as infectious as delta, though its deadliness is lower. And though 2022 may see a few more waves, each could be of lessening severity given the improvement in the availability of medical tools in the developed world such as triple-dose vaccines, antiviral therapeutics and treatment, as well as the protection afforded by prior natural infection. Of course, the uncertainty around this base case remains enormous and, as such, well reflected in the prices of direct plays on an end to COVID-19, on Working from Home and on full re-opening of the global economy.

In this environment, we believe the focus on bottom-up selection will remain a crucial source of returns. Does the recent spread widening signal a regime change? Four pillars supported credit markets for much of 2021, leading to assets looking fully valued\u2026 Easy financial conditions driven by stimulative monetary and fiscal policy Economic growth rebound supported by vaccinations and economies reopening Corporates performing well with management focused on a conservative strategy Excess liquidity supporting company refinancing and low default rates \u2026But markets are ending the year concerned that the backdrop has changed, causing credit spreads to widen. High inflation is increasing the risk that financial conditions tighten The pandemic is mutating, causing increased risk of new global lockdowns Fiscal measures are not affordable either politically or financially given the level of public debt Central bank corporate buying programs are expected to be curtailed Credit looks fully valued The credit spread widening in November 2021 could be interpreted as \u201cindigestion,\u201d or a signpost to a new regime where the macro economy is less supportive. Considering the business cycle, current market conditions are consistent with the early expansionary phase (Display 1). Corporate strategy is conservative (management still has concerns over the pandemic), economic policy is accommodative, and liquidity is plentiful, creating a goldilocks backdrop for credit investors. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Current market conditions are consistent with early expansion \uf065 Provided for illustrated purposes only \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Current market conditions are consistent with early expansion Provided for illustrated purposes only We do not see signals that we are entering a late cycle, but we do expect volatility in 2022. We expect the market will overpredict the next downturn, likely focusing on either a policy error by central banks, or an escalation in the economic slowdown caused by new developments in the pandemic. We expect spreads to be rangebound in 2022, between the approximate long-run average where we are currently, and the tights of 2021. Corporate performance is expected to remain strong in 2022, supporting credit spreads STRONG EARNINGS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE: Under the umbrella of the pandemic, corporates have managed costs efficiently to support profitability. Looking to 2022, while there are concerns that profitability will be impacted by higher costs, forward guidance suggests many industries have pricing power, i.e. the ability to raise prices, to help protect profitability. BALANCE SHEETS WILL STAY CONSERVATIVE: While we remain under the influence of the pandemic, company managements are expected to remain cautious. Cash balances built up to weather uncertainty will be retained, and significant investment or strategic change will be delayed until the outlook becomes clearer. While we have seen some increase in debt at high quality corporates (A-rated or higher), these companies have the capacity and flexibility to manage the increase, with debt costs low and central banks providing liquidity in recent times for the Investment Grade (IG) sector. M&amp;A RISK WILL CONTINUE: Deal volume is expected to increase in 2022. Much of the activity will see divisions divested to sponsor companies or industry consolidation funded conservatively with a combination of debt and equity. MODERATELY INCREASING CAPEX: Capital expenditure (capex) has been below expectations on numerous occasions post-financial crisis. We expect a modest uplift in 2022. Labour shortages driving the substitution of machinery, sustainability driving investment into renewables, de-globalisation driving investment in supply chains and tax incentives all point to more capex at the margin, but we expect caution to prevail in the C-suite. We do not expect leverage to increase because of higher capex as earnings and free cash flow should fund much of the investment. High Yield Corporates Over Investment Grade We expect default rates to fall in 2022 and stay low reflective of the strength in corporate risk profiles supporting high yield (Display 2). With investment grade more sensitive to risk free rates, we prefer the shorter maturity and greater yield offered by owning lower rated corporates. \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: Default rates are expected to fall in 2022, reflecting corporate strength \uf065 Source: Moody\u2019s Annual Default Study Forecasts/estimates are based on current market conditions, subject to change, and may not necessarily come to pass. \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: Default rates are expected to fall in 2022, reflecting corporate strength Source: Moody\u2019s Annual Default Study Forecasts/estimates are based on current market conditions, subject to change, and may not necessarily come to pass. Emerging Market Corporates Over Developed Since the start of the pandemic emerging market corporates have improved credit metrics through discipline and patience, fortifying balance sheets and conserving liquidity. The regional economies are sensitive to vaccination rates as well as capital flows that are in turn sensitive to relative growth rates. Looking to 2022 we expect emerging economies to benefit from a global reopening underpinned by increased vaccination, greater immunity, and a political shift to support regional growth. Against this backdrop we see value in the extra yield offered by emerging corporates but would look to active management given the geopolitical risks in key geographies and the social agendas that favour reducing inequality. Value in Companies with Improving Sustainability Metrics 2021 saw investors continue to focus on sustainability as a core objective. As ESG data becomes more standardized and sustainability portfolio guidelines more prescriptive, we expect the demand for issuers and sectors that meet sustainable criteria to increase at the expense of laggards. One area of opportunity is companies that are demonstrating positive momentum in improving their sustainability profile, in response to engagement. We expect these companies to benefit from improving ESG data in 2022. Market Technicals Mean Rangebound Trading in 2022 2022 will likely see supply broadly inline with 2021, given our expectations of no irregular spike in M&amp;A or capex led issuance. At the same time, we expect demand to be buttressed by two competing factors: 1) a generally less easy monetary policy from central banks and QE programs, and 2) an ever-ageing demographic where pension funds need to rebalance to match liabilities more closely. In this environment, we expect volatility induced by technicals to be an opportunity for the active investor in 2022. Conclusion Corporates are in good shape going into next year and are expected to work for all stakeholders, including the bondholder. Valuations have cheapened in recent weeks reflective of increased uncertainty and some market indigestion, creating opportunities in the credit market. Historically the early stages of the expansionary economic phase have experienced credit spreads that trade in a range, which is our base expectation for 2022. Moreover, the themes discussed in our outlook, including the continuation of M&amp;A, slightly less supportive policy, and the continued focus on sustainability momentum by investors, could result in greater spread dispersion between issuers. As a result, we are focused on two dimensions for the year ahead. Firstly, we are biased to own default risk over credit beta risk, particularly in pockets such as High Yield and Emerging Markets, and plan to actively trade on market technicals. Secondly, we continue to focus on bottom-up security selection to capitalise on spread dispersion opportunities. \u00d7 RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. High-yield securities (\u201cjunk bonds\u201d) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). ESG Strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 Richard Ford Managing Director Investment Grade Credit Team Joseph Mehlman Managing Director Investment Grade Credit Team Richard Lindquist Managing Director High Yield Team Warren Mar Managing Director Investment Grade Credit Team Tom Wills Managing Director High Yield Team Jim Caron Managing Director Global Fixed Income Team Multi-Sector Fixed Income Team", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/corporate-performance-to-support-credit-spreads.html"}

{"content": "November continued where October left off: heightened volatility, hawkish (or less dovish) central bank rhetoric, rising yields and flattening yield curves. However, around mid-month things changed. The discovery of the Omicron variant and its uncertain impact in conjunction with hawkish central banks upended credit and equity markets. After making new highs on November 18th, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell almost 3% over the remainder of the month. Credit spreads, after gently widening over the previous two months, widened significantly. But longer maturity U.S. Treasury yields and other risk-free government bond yields fell sharply (German yields fell more than U.S. Treasury yields) and yield curves flattened in response to sell-offs in equities and credit, worries about growth, and the worry that the Fed would be accelerating tightening into an uncertain post-Omicron world.1 \u00d7 It seems like only yesterday hopes were high that vaccines would allow the world to normalize and get back to where things were pre-pandemic. In terms of economics, many countries are getting there; e.g., recovering lost output and getting back to full employment. But it is happening at a cost: higher inflation. How will Omicron impact the growth/inflation nexus? If the world is lucky, it will prove to be a milder version, less lethal, less virulent in terms of its negative health implications. If so, it could accelerate the process of moving to a more normal world. Strong growth, higher inflation, higher interest rates is probably okay for credit and equity markets. On the other hand, suppose it is a more transmissible Delta-like variant? Maybe more resistant to existing vaccines? Will growth weaken? Will inflation worsen? Will economies weaken due to intensified supply side issues? And/or will it constrain demand as mobility decreases once again? And how will it impact monetary policies? For now, we think the best working assumption is that Omicron will not cause any radical changes in health outcomes or economic behavior. If true, the biggest risk for financial markets is inflation and how central banks react. We are seeing today probably the greatest dispersion in central bank policies (current and prospective) in many years. Most importantly, the Fed has changed its tune most aggressively: from believing inflation was predominantly transitory, it now believes it is likely to be persistent, necessitating a change in policy. Tapering of QE is likely to accelerate so that it ends before July; Chairman Powell has stated as much in recent comments. This opens the door to rate hikes sooner, possibly as soon as the second quarter. Other central banks are more sanguine on the inflation outlook: the European Central Bank (ECB), People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC), Bank of Japan, Swedish Riskbank, and the Reserve Bank of Australia. On the other hand, many central banks, primarily in emerging markets, are tightening policy aggressively. Amongst developed countries, the UK, Canadian and New Zealand central banks look set to raise rates before the Fed or, in the case of New Zealand, continue to raise them. A key question for financial markets will be to what extent central banks follow through on their current plans. Clearly, if a central bank was dovish prior to Omicron, it is likely to be more dovish post. For example, the Swedish central bank is adamant that essentially all the inflation spike is transitory and therefore there is no need to raise rates before 2024! On the other hand, the UK -- not too distant from Sweden -- seems quite keen to raise rates immediately, although recent comments suggest there could be advantages to waiting for more evidence on the impact of Omicron. Regarding the Fed, there appears to be no impediment to accelerating tapering. This was an emergency program to deal with the initial impact of the pandemic. With inflation where it is and growth and employment strong, why should QE exist? It should not. Fortunately, for the Fed, the decision to raise rates can be postponed for several months while QE is tapered, allowing more time to evaluate the impact of the Omicron variant and the path of inflation. All in all, we expect central banks to proceed cautiously in the near future. In terms of our market views, we have generally been reducing portfolio risk given the uncertain outlook. We remain long risky assets (corporate credit, securitized credit, emerging markets), a bit less than last month, because of the positive economic outlook and strong fundamentals. We expect government bond yields to reverse at least some of their Omicron related fall but meaningful rises will depend on three things: equity market stabilization, Fed hawkishness, and volatility. But it will be a \u201clong and winding road\u201d. \u00d7 Display 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date \uf065 Note: USD-based performance. Source: Bloomberg. Data as of November 30, 2021.

Fixed Income Outlook November looked like a repeat of October until the Omicron variant was uncovered. Central banks continued to talk and act hawkishly. Yields were rising and curves were flattening. And volatility was up. But then the Omicron variant arrived or, more precisely, was uncovered. This, in conjunction with demanding valuations and Fed hawkishness, hit credit and equity markets. Until mid-month the S&amp;P 500 was making new highs. Over the remainder of the month, it lost almost 3%. Investment grade spreads widened approximately 12 basis points (bps) (a big move for this market) and high yield 50 bps -- moves that far from qualify as a bear market, but a meaningful correction nonetheless given underlying solid corporate fundamentals. Given the absence of any meaningful corrections in these markets for over a year, maybe one was overdue and a healthy development given the somewhat exuberant state of financial markets in recent months. Looking into the future, our assumption is that the Omicron variant (and/ the residual effects of Delta variant) will not derail the underlying economic story underpinning financial markets. Yes, the pandemic will continue to find ways to act as a headwind; and yes, central banks and policymakers in general (outside of China) are dialing back support for economies, but household and corporate fundamentals look solid enough to generate above-trend growth, and, unfortunately, above-target inflation in 2022. Inflation remains a problem for most countries while growth outlooks remain resilient despite pandemic headwinds (i.e., mobility constraints and drags from energy prices). Global growth should accelerate in the fourth quarter with little abatement of inflation pressures, which do not seem to have peaked with the Omicron variant likely to not be helpful in terms of reducing inflation pressures. Unfortunately, this means that inflation concerns are likely to remain and central banks, like the Fed, will remain on a course of reducing accommodation. Despite a lot of inflation angst, we expect central banks to move slowly and deliberately, particularly with the Omicron variant out there. We must keep in mind that, although the Fed is now firmly in the reduce-accommodation camp, the other three big central banks are clearly not: ECB, PBOC, BoJ. Global monetary policy in the more advanced economies is unlikely to tighten much in 2022. Emerging Market (EM) central banks are on a different trajectory, especially in Latin America and CEMEA. For those central banks moving to tighten, they are very likely to move slowly and will avoid doing anything to suggest policy needs to be \u201ctight\u201d rather than just \u201cless easy\u201d. But it must be said, with the Fed likely to end QE in the first half of 2022 and countenancing rate hikes in 2022, it will be easier for other central banks to follow. This relatively sanguine monetary policy outlook is not without risk. Inflationary pressures are not abating, or at least not fast enough. Worries about second round effects and surging housing markets worry central banks. The most recent surge has come from higher energy prices (especially European natural gas prices), but the pressure is more broad-based: many other commodities (e.g., food, a particular concern for EM central banks) are also at multi-year highs; COVID-induced bottlenecks continue to cause shortages in many consumer goods supply chains, and there are widespread reports of labor shortages across developed economies. Omicron may in fact exacerbate some of these issues. It is currently unclear just how persistent, or permanent, many of these issues are, but what is certain is that the current surge in inflation is expected to last longer than previously thought. Thus, the need for central banks to play defense and engage risk mitigation strategies, which imply reduced accommodation. One important factor keeping longer maturity yields low (outside of massive global liquidity) is, in our view, expectations that terminal rates, i.e., the peak in policy rates, will not reach new highs. Indeed, current market expectations are that peak rates this cycle will be meaningfully lower than last cycle (2015-2018). The risk to bond valuations comes more from the length of the hiking cycle and the eventual terminal policy rate rather than the pace or start date (although they matter for the shape of the yield curve). But if the market starts expecting a more normal central bank cycle, then we believe yields should rise further. Credit investors have also become more nervous recently, causing credit spreads to widen; we think this is mainly reflective of how tight spreads have become rather than any meaningful increase in default risk or deteriorating fundamentals. Further widening could be a buying opportunity. EM risk remains predominantly on the local side. Very hawkish central banks, with inflation pressures still evident, make it premature, despite significant rate hikes in recent months, to get bullish. The Fed moving to a less accommodative posture in the months ahead is also likely to be a challenge. Politics in several countries is also taking its toll. Where does this leave our views on markets? In general, we remain overweight the riskier, cyclical sectors but we have been reducing our exposure at the margin given valuations and increased volatility/uncertainty. On government bonds, we expect yields to move higher, but this is likely to be a long process given high global liquidity/savings and a likely slow tightening cycle. That said, we think low expected terminal rates and highly negative real yields make longer-maturity bonds relatively unappealing. Shorter maturity bonds are more interesting due to much higher risk premiums now priced in. The danger is those expectations of tightening could increase if inflation remains stubbornly elevated in December and early 2022. And, of course, Omicron remains an unknown. We remain overweight corporate credit (although less so than last month) and securitized products, particularly lower quality investment grade bonds and selective high yield (avoiding too much market beta); we are overweight in selective emerging markets, where there are, in our view, idiosyncratic reasons to be bullish. Developed Market (DM) Rate/Foreign Currency (FX) Monthly Review November was full of volatility in the developed markets. Initially, strong economic data, inflation concerns, and hawkish beliefs drove rates up, inflation expectations higher, and yield curves steeper. In the end, however, that story was overshadowed by COVID concerns, which reversed the prior movements. The initial increases in rates were reversed into overall rate declines and yield curves to their flattest levels of the year.2 Outlook If Omicron has a significantly negative impact on the economic outlook, then government bonds could remain well supported at current levels for some time. However, repeated upside inflation surprises, and some signs of inflation persistence, are pressuring central banks to normalize monetary policy quicker. We expect most DM central banks to have started hiking rates in 2022 (if they haven\u2019t already), with the ECB, RBA and BoJ being notable exceptions. In currency markets, we see value in many emerging markets vs. G10. However, negative risk sentiment and greater macro risks mean EM FX could continue to trade cheap for some time. Amongst G10 currencies, we see limited valuation differences and hence are relatively neutral on our currency positioning. Emerging Market (EM) Rate/FX Monthly Review EM debt returns were negative in November, with hard currency sovereigns -1.8%, on wider spreads, partially offset by a rally in U.S. Treasuries.3 EM Corporates returns were negative for the month with high yield underperforming investment grade corporates. Local currency bonds posted negative returns, primarily due to weaker EM currencies against the U.S. dollar. From a broad market perspective, Malaysia, Morocco, Hungary and China were the best performers in November, while bonds from Lebanon, Ethiopia and El Salvador were laggards. From a sectoral perspective, Diversified and Infrastructure companies led the market, while those in the Oil &amp; Gas, Metals &amp; Mining and Real Estate sectors lagged.4, 5 Outlook We have a cautious stance towards Emerging Market debt at present on the back of tighter global monetary policy in the face of rising inflation, as well as uncertainty over the transmissibility of the new Omicron variant and its potential impact on global growth and inflation. Notwithstanding cheap valuations, high-yield sovereigns may continue to underperform investment-grade credits in the near term. Similarly, on the local side, EMFX may face near term challenges if dollar strength persists. In local rates, we prefer yield curves that are already pricing in aggressive monetary policy tightening. Credit Monthly Review Credit spreads widened meaningfully in November on the risk-off sentiment. Sector and corporate news were dominated by Q3 earnings reports that confirmed performance was healthy and the impact of cost increases on margins was less than expected.6 The high yield market came under pressure in November amidst elevated volatility across global risk markets. The average credit spread widened by more than a half-percent by month-end.7 Global convertibles underperformed both equity and credit in November as the Refinitiv Global Convertibles Focus Index fell.8 Loan prices steadily firmed for much of November\u2019s opening three weeks. Record-setting investor demand and an overall supply-deficit technical condition remained the catalysts. Loan prices later softened from November highs after the holiday however, as virus headlines took their toll on investor psyches and ultimately capital markets.9 Outlook Looking forward we see little changed in the base case credit outlook with valuations looking full but fundamentals well supported by the four pillars of (1) expectations financial conditions will remain easy supporting low default rates (2) economic activity that is expected to rebound as vaccinations allow economies to reopen (3) strong corporate profitability with conservative balance sheet management as overall uncertainty remains high (4) demand for credit to stay strong as excess liquidity looks to be invested. We expect some volatility into year-end given the current uncertainty and lack of appetite for risk positioning. Securitized Products Monthly Review Securitized markets remained choppy in November with performance largely driven by liquidity and depth of sponsorship rather than specific credit concerns. New issuance and secondary activity both remained high, and larger and more-liquid sectors outperformed more esoteric sectors.10 Agency MBS underperformed meaningfully in November, impacted by the flattening curve and potentially accelerated Fed taper expectations.11 U.S. Non-agency RMBS spreads were mixed, but generally either flat or wider across most residential sectors. Non-agency RMBS new issuance remained high, putting supply pressure on some parts of the markets.12 U.S. ABS spreads were also generally wider, with both more liquid sectors (auto and credit card) and less liquid sectors (aircraft, consumer loans, etc) experiencing spread widening.13 U.S. CMBS spreads also widened.14 European RMBS, CMBS and ABS activity remained high, and European spreads remained steady. European securitized spreads remain relatively tight compared to comparable U.S. securitized assets, despite talk of the ECB potentially reducing its asset purchases.15 Outlook We expect market activity to slow in December. Higher rates, wider spreads and approaching year-end could cool overall activity levels. Credit fundamentals should remain healthy, especially for residential and consumer assets. European securitized markets should remain well supported by the historically low rates in Europe and by the asset purchase programs and lending programs of the ECB and BOE, although these purchase programs could also be reduced in the coming months. \u00d7 1 Source: Bloomberg.

There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. \u00d7 Global Fixed Income Team Our fixed income investment capabilities are driven by eight specialized teams \u2013 Agency MBS, Emerging Markets, Floating-Rate Loans, High Yield, Investment Grade Credit, Municipals, Multi-Sector, and Securitized \u2013 which span the global fixed income capital markets.

{"content": "Will the Bears have a better 2022? Or will the Bulls surprise yet again? We have many sports teams here in Chicago, but for 2021, two notable ones are the Chicago BULLS of the NBA and the Chicago BEARS of the NFL. The Bears came into the 2021/2022 season with high hopes and great fanfare. The Bulls?\u2026yawn. How wrong those expectations have been! The Bulls are blazing this year with one of their best records since the Michael Jordan era. The Bears? A big disappointment. (As a long-time Chicago Bears fan, it pains me to say that the Green Bay Packers have truly \u201downed\u201d da Bears.) There is a parallel to the 2021 year for the stock market. Bull market believers were too restrained, while Bear market believers were too confident. If we rewind the clock to our January 2021 Slimmon\u2019s TAKE, we wrote: \u00d7 \" We expect 2021 to be similar to 2010, the second year of a new bull market. Following the historically strong year in 2009, the market returned a good year overall in 2010*. In 2010, the S&amp;P 500 returned just over 15%. Unless things continue to be very ugly these last couple of weeks of the year, which I doubt, the S&amp;P 500 is going to pull a \u2018Chicago Bulls\u2019, not a \u2018Chicago Bears\u2019. Far better than what most expected. I\u2019m not a market sage. I just know that patterns tend to repeat themselves, primarily because human behavior really does not change. Central banks pump liquidity into an economic problem, but investors only start to feel better about the situation as the problem recedes further into the rear-view mirror. Usually it takes at least one year before investor sentiment lifts. The ensuing 2021 inflows combined with stellar corporate earnings results drove equities up this year just as they did in 1991, 2003 and 2010, all second years after recessionary lows. For those who predicted a more bearish 2021.\u2026well, they have gone the way of Chicago Bears fans. More importantly, they ignored history. It was simply too soon following the March 2020 low to become negative. So, as we consider a first pass on what the equity market holds for 2022, here are the S&amp;P 500 returns the third year off recent recession lows:1,2 I. 1992 +7.62% (bear market low 1990) II. II. 2004 +10.88% (bear market low 2002) III. III. 2011 +2.11% (bear market low 2009) See the historical consistency? Positive, but far more modest returns. Less good for the Bulls, less bad for the Bears. This makes sense to me. In this second year past the recession low, we have had very strong fundamentals AND a supremely accommodative Fed. But in the third year, there will likely be more of a battle. On one hand, we believe strong corporate fundamentals will continue to exceed Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Yet central bank policy will begin to pivot from its accommodative stance. That will result in lower, but positive, returns. To conclude, I don\u2019t believe 2022 will be all that different than we\u2019ve experienced in the past. As stated above, I am very confident about corporate fundamentals. However, the Fed is going to throw a little cold water on the environment. Hence, I expect mid to high single-digit returns for the equity market next year. Too simplistic? Fair criticism. Yet, what I know is that the bear calls for significant corrections in 2021 kept many investors on the sidelines resulting in a loss of focus on what really matters. Namely that stocks have done well in the second year of a bull market. What worries me is that even though 2022 will likely be another decent, but not spectacular, year, larger drawdowns along the way (quite likely in a lower returning environment) will allow the Bears to roar a little louder, thereby scaring even more investors. In the end, I suspect the Bulls will outshine the Bears yet again in 2022. Of course, this is at the overall S&amp;P 500 level. Alpha opportunities for stock picking will abound, just as they have this year. \u00d7 * 2021 Slimmon\u2019s TAKE: 2021 Market Outlook, January 2021 1 First year being the year of the low. 2 S&amp;P 500 total return The index performance is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment.

{"content": "With the threats of inflation and tighter Fed monetary policy looming, we believe bonds are not likely to be as effective as an equity hedge in traditional diversified portfolios. Certain alternative risk premia (ARP) can, in our view, fill the role of bonds in a diversified portfolio without the need to take long-duration risk. New analysis by Morgan Stanley Investment Management\u2019s AIP Hedge Fund Solutions Group shows that an equal risk-weighted ARP portfolio has been an effective bond alternative, potentially delivering strong returns when equities sold off, while still preserving capital during bond bear markets. \u00d7 For many decades, the classic portfolio allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds has been a mainstay for investors seeking to hedge equity risk. But our analysis of recent equity and bond performance calls into question how effective this approach is likely to be in coming years, as their correlation has steadily moved upward into positive territory (Display 1). \u00d7 DISPLAY 1 Equities and Bonds Have Become Positively Correlated in Recent Years \uf065 Sources: Morgan Stanley AIP, Bloomberg LLC, MSCI, from 12/31/18 through 9/3/21.

The forces driving the positive correlation stem from the low yields that have been prevalent in government and investment-grade corporate bonds. But the threat of inflation and the more hawkish stance recently adopted by the U.S. Federal Reserve boost the likelihood that rates will rise and put downward pressure on bond prices, especially for long-duration sectors. Thus, many investors are looking for alternatives that can substitute for at least a portion of their government and investment-grade bond portfolio. Alternative risk premia (ARP) deserve consideration because they can fill the role of bonds in a diversified portfolio: delivering positive expected returns with low or negative correlation to equities, but without the need to take long-duration risk. However, ARP are a heterogeneous category, with about a dozen long-standing, well-known strategies (and many more niche and newer ones), spanning all asset classes including equities, rates, commodities, and currencies. ARP do not comprise a true asset class, but share the common trait of not being long-only traditional investments. Many ARP are countercyclical to equities, but some are very much pro-cyclical. This report reviews how ARP have performed during different market environments, or regimes, both in the context of an equal risk-weighted portfolio of the most common strategies, and individually, based on risk-adjusted return. Defining the Bond Regimes ARP factors behave differently from each other and across market regimes. So a fundamental consideration is to seek to avoid strategies likely to perform poorly at the same time as bonds, while at least preserving capital when equities sell off. To define bond regimes, we use a well-known framework based on yield curve movement. We define the four regimes as combinations of bull/bear and steepener/ flattener bond markets (described in Display 2). Bull/bear markets are defined based on the direction of shift of overall yield curve either upward or downward, while steepener/flattener measures the change in yield curve slope. Below the description of bond regime in each quadrant, Display 2 also highlights the best- and worst-performing ARPs for the 10 years ended August 31, 2021. \u00d7 DISPLAY 2 The Four Basic Bond Regimes and Related ARP Performance \uf065 Sources: Morgan Stanley AIP, Goldman Sachs, ICE BofA, Bloomberg, JP Morgan, Societe Generale, Macquarie, for the 10 years ended 8/31/21. Long-term yields are represented by the 10-year U.S. Treasury; short-term yields by the 2-year U.S. Treasury. Relative performance of the 10-year and 2-year Treasuries was evaluated for each of the 523 weeks during the 10-year performance period, and categorized as one of the four regimes described above.

The Equal Risk-Weighted ARP Portfolio To test the effectiveness of ARPs as an alternative to diversification1 with bonds, we constructed an equal risk-weighted portfolio of well-defined strategies in carry, value, and trend/momentum that are included in Display 2. The portfolio targets 5% annualized volatility, similar to a core bond portfolio or index. Because a majority of our set are countercyclical (although certainly not all, such as equity value and FX carry), and given their equal risk-weighting, the portfolio is designed with a defensive equity tilt. By adjusting the risk weightings away from equal, investors can tilt the portfolio to one regime or another, depending on their views, investment objectives and risk constraints. \u00d7 DISPLAY 3 ARP Have Performed Well as Equity Hedges in All Regimes \uf065 Sources: Morgan Stanley AIP, Goldman Sachs, ICE BofA, Bloomberg, JP Morgan, Societe Generale, Macquarie, for the 10 years ended 8/31/21.

The results showed that the diversified ARP has been an effective bond alternative, delivering strong returns during weak periods for equities (bond bull regimes).

Following are highlights of portfolio performance and constituent ARPs: The ARP portfolio performed best in bond bull markets, largely because both bonds and the portfolio tend to outperform when equities are struggling. However, the portfolio also helped preserve capital in bond bear environments, especially when flattening. For example, during bond bull regimes, when the S&amp;P 500 was down by 13.8%, the Bloomberg Treasury Index was up 24.8%, while the ARP portfolio gained 15.9%. However, when the Bloomberg Treasury Index was down 18.6% in a bond bear market, the ARP portfolio was down just 0.3%. Bond bear markets hurt the curve carry strategy and are not a particularly rich environment for the equity strategies, but cross-market rates (duration neutral), currency strategies, and commodities performed well. The weakest environment for the ARP portfolio has been bear steepening. Bear steepening tends to coincide with the strongest equity bull markets, which is the weakest environment for this set of strategies, given its aggregate defensive equity tilt. Nonetheless, it is a strong environment for equity value and most commodity strategies, which keeps the portfolio close to flat during these times. Display 4 shows visually the strong correlation between the portfolio and long-term U.S. Treasuries over the past decade, with both providing hedging benefits for equity portfolios. However, as noted earlier, we believe U.S. Treasuries are vulnerable in a rising-rate environment due to their long duration, which is absent in the portfolio. Indeed, as shown in Display 3, for the 12 months ended 8/31/21, as the Bloomberg Treasury Index sold off by 1.9%, the portfolio returned 3.9%. ARP Risk-Adjusted Returns2 For another perspective on ARP performance, we analyzed the same strategies over the 2011-2021 period on a risk-adjusted basis, using information ratios (return per unit of volatility), broken into the same four bond regimes. Because information ratios scale the return of each ARP by its own volatility, this analysis offers investors additional insight that may be useful tilting their own portfolios. In contrast, the portfolio discussed above weighted each factor to our desired 5% volatility. The third column from the right in Displays 5A through 5E shows the information ratio of the equal risk-weighted ARP portfolio, discussed above, for reference. In all regimes except the bear steepener, the portfolio had large information ratios. Equity low volatility, equity momentum and equity quality strategies are historically highly correlated to U.S. Treasuries (Display 5A). They have done particularly poorly during periods of bear steepening, when investors are anticipating inflation (and equities are often performing quite well). These strategies have no explicit duration risk (being long and short equities only), but like U.S. government rates, they tend to perform well in equity market selloffs and perform poorly in strong bull markets. Thus, high correlation to rates is driven more by the shared countercyclical tilt of the strategies than a common fundamental risk exposure.3 This is evidenced by recent performance of quality and low volatility, which have done well this year despite the poor performance of duration risk. \u00d7 DISPLAY 5A EQ Low Volatility, EQ Momentum and EQ Quality (But not EQ Value): Historically Correlated with UST \uf065 Source: Morgan Stanley AIP, Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg, for the 10 years ended 8/31/21.

Momentum has done poorly this year, not because of rates correlation, but rather the lack of a strong exploitable long-term trend in equities. Conversely, the equity value strategy exhibits negative correlation to rates and historically outperforms in yield widening and curve steepening environments. Value is the most pro-cyclical of our four equity factors. Value stocks, such as financials, utilities, etc., tend to outperform growth stocks in rising rates and steepening yield curve environments. Multi-asset trend fares relatively well in all four bond regimes thanks in part to its diversification across different markets (equities, FX, rates, bonds) and across different time frames (Display 5B). Long-term trend captures slow and steady changes in rates and bond performance and generates strong performance during flattening yield curve regimes. Short-term trend has strong defensive characteristics during a steepening yield curve environment. \u00d7 DISPLAY 5B Multi-asset trend: Fares Relatively Well in All Four Bond Regimes \uf065 Source: Morgan Stanley AIP, Bloomberg, JP Morgan, Macquarie, for the 10 years ended 8/31/21.

Commodities, as an asset class, are often expected to perform well in an inflationary environment benefiting from expected rise in commodity prices (Display 5C). ARP commodity strategies, however, are market neutral (both long and short positions) and behave differently. Curve carry performs better in bull than bear markets while commodity carry performs better in yield curve flattening regimes. The commodity value strategy, which generally benefits from relative-price mean reversion between like commodities (such as Brent and WTI crude oil prices), produces persistent positive returns in all four bond regimes, as price dislocations can happen in both bull or bear regimes. \u00d7 DISPLAY 5C Commodities: Mixed Performance \uf065 Sources: Morgan Stanley AIP, ICE BofA, Bloomberg, for the 10 years ended 8/31/21.

Rates curve carry is the ARP strategy that typically carries the most explicit duration risk (Display 5D). It can be implemented in a variety of ways but generally has net long-duration risk. As a result, the strategy tends to perform better during bond bull markets. Cross-market carry is focused on spread differences in government bonds across countries, typically at the same tenor or in a duration-neutral manner (although, again, your mileage may vary depending on implementation). As a result, cross-market rates carry strategy delivers positive return both in bull and bear yield environments with better performance in flattener than steepener environments. \u00d7 DISPLAY 5D Rates curve: The Most Explicit Duration Risk \uf065 Sources: Morgan Stanley AIP, Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg, Societe Generale, for the 10 years ended 8/31/21.

Currency value and carry strategies have presented relatively good performance during all four bond regimes (Display 5E). While currency valuations are tied to rates and can be affected by changes in the U.S. rate curve, like cross-market rates carry, the driver of performance is driven by changes in rate differentials across countries, not within tenors of the U.S. rate curve.

Year-to-Date ARP Performance We began this report with the observation that ARP strategies are likely to hold up better than bonds as rates come under pressure from Fed policy and inflation. So far, this year has underscored the validity of that view, as the equal risk-weighted portfolio discussed above would have returned 6.3% through August 31. In contrast, U.S. government bonds recently suffered through one of the worst performance periods in decades, including a sharp bear steepening to start 2021. The drawdown in the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Index (the Index) was its largest since 1994, with a loss of 6% from August 2020 through March 2021. Year-to-date through August 31, the Index is down -1.4%. The U.S. Treasury 10-year yield rose from 0.9% at beginning of the year to 1.3% at the end of August. During this difficult period for bonds, many ARP delivered positive returns, including equity low volatility and equity quality. This year so far, investors have gravitated to lower volatility stocks and stocks with good earnings quality (which were cheap headed into 2021.) Trend, commodity carry, curve carry, FX value and FX carry strategies are all also positive. Only equity momentum and commodity value strategies have struggled.

The ARP Hedge Edge Investors are rightly concerned that bonds may no longer be a suitable hedge for equities in today\u2019s environment. We have shown that a well-designed diversified portfolio of ARP can serve as a viable alternative. This hypothetical portfolio would have delivered positive expected returns with low or negative correlation to equities, but without forcing investors to assume the duration risk embedded in much of the bond market. \u00d7 1 Diversification to does not eliminate the risk of loss. 2 For illustrative purposes only.

{"content": "Global markets fell sharply as Omicron, a new mutation of COVID emerged. Prior to the volatility on 26 November, markets had been up on the month, although having less momentum than previous rebounds. The S&amp;P 500 and MSCI Europe Index subsequently closed the month down -0.7% (USD) and -2.5% (EUR) respectively 1. The MSCI Japan Index was down over the month at -2.9% (JPY)1. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index was hit harder, down -4.1% (USD).1 \u00d7 There was trouble for this year\u2019s star sector, as energy became this month\u2019s worst performing sector, with the MSCI ACWI Energy (TR) Index down -6.9% (USD)1. After a period of relatively low volatility, the VIX spiked to 28.62 on the day Omicron came to light, remaining elevated through to month end. It is still unclear how severe the new variant is and whether vaccines will provide enough defence. However, the uncertainty was enough of a catalyst for a selloff. US interest rates likely to rise, but only moderately Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s Senate testimony as November drew to a close, was surprisingly hawkish, despite acknowledging the risk of Omicron. Chairman Powell\u2019s indication that it is time to stop using the term \u201ctransitory\u201d to describe inflation, accordingly triggered a negative market reaction. Indeed, if there are further port closures and supply issues as a result of this new variant of COVID, this is likely to exacerbate inflation. We expect US interest rates to rise, but only moderately because we expect the Fed to aim to minimise the impact on markets. However, in this higher risk environment, a path of normalisation for rates, which does not upset markets, but which effectively counters inflationary pressures, is getting increasingly difficult to achieve. Global shipping disruptions \u2013 are we there yet? With global supply chain disruptions having been with us for much of 2021, due to a combination of demand induced by the pandemic and supply bottlenecks \u2013 many are asking when this will finally be alleviated. Industry surveys indicate that 50% of respondents expect to wait until 1H22 and 33% until 2H22 for normalisation3 Investment Implications On a forward-looking basis, the rising uncertainty about how much the Fed may taper, suggests maintaining a cautious risk exposure. Having trimmed our overweight to value in September, we have trimmed our underweight to growth in November. We also reduced our position in energy and added to Chinese internet equities from a tactical standpoint: Global Energy We have been overweight global energy since January 2021. We implemented this as part of our rotation to cyclicals and value. At the time, US and European energy were trading at a discount to the broader market, but fundamentals were improving. Since then, energy has soared and despite recent struggles, it is still the best performing sector year-to-date, with the MSCI ACWI Energy returning 32.2% (USD)4. With the US government taking action to curb the increase in oil prices \u2013 a trend which could cap the upside in the short term, we have trimmed to take profits. Chinese Internet Equities We implemented a modest overweight to Chinese internet equities in September 2021, given strong fundamentals, stablising regulatory headwinds and attractive valuations since the more than 50% decline since February 2021\u2019s peak 5. We added to this position, given we should be closer to the bottom of the regulatory cycle and valuations remain attractive.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser\u2019s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio\u2019s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio\u2019s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. \u00d7 Andrew Harmstone Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Manfred Hui Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Select Product(s) Right Click Edit", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/feds-hawkish-turn-inflation-no-longer-transitory.html"}

{"content": "It\u2019s not demand, it\u2019s supply: Eighteen months ago, demand for goods and services collapsed as the COVID-19 pandemic swept over the globe. Many countries suffered their largest gross domestic product contractions ever recorded. \u00d7 Today, with some exceptions (e.g., the travel industry), demand for goods and services in the corporate world is stronger than ever. But companies are facing more operational challenges due to a squeeze in supply chains resulting from shortages in labour, raw materials and components, as well as tight logistics capacity, all putting upward pressure on costs and restricting product availability. \u00d7 \" COVID-19 has led to a dramatic shift in the types of goods and services people want We are now observing something unusual: profit warnings due to a lack of supply, rather than an unexpected drop in demand. How did we get here? Put simply, COVID-19 has led to a dramatic shift in the types of goods and services people want over a relatively short space of time. This isn\u2019t a huge surprise because the way we live and operate, for the broad population, has changed dramatically. Such rapid shifts in demand are not easily matched by supply chains, which take longer to build up. If we take a specific example, demand for sporting goods has surged. Over the past 18 months, we have seen an acceleration of a fairly established trend as people have looked to stay fit and healthy in new ways due to the pandemic. The importance of being fit and healthy has been brought to the front of mind for many people. \u00d7 \" A lack of shipping containers and port capacity is resulting in goods taking twice as long to reach their destination Sporting goods manufacturers are largely based in Southeast Asia, specifically Vietnam, Cambodia and China. Vietnam is a clear reminder that the pandemic remains with us, almost two years after it began. A government-ordered lockdown in Vietnam has resulted in factory closures, causing many weeks of lost production, and many weeks to ramp back up. Footwear and apparel, which need to travel across the globe to reach consumers, have been delayed due to a lack of shipping containers and port capacity, resulting in goods taking twice as long to reach their destination. This is a knock-on effect from the collapse in air travel, which has eliminated a significant proportion of air freight capacity, pushing up costs and encouraging businesses to switch to ocean freight. The result? Lost sales as fewer shoes and clothes make it to shelves. How big a problem is this? As the entire industry uses outsourced production, largely from the same suppliers, it is an industry-wide problem, not a company-specific one. On balance, they all lose out. Profits will take a hit, ironically because fewer goods will ultimately be sold. There may be some partial compensation from net pricing because there will be limited unsold inventory to discount. This is something the industry is striving for to improve gross margins and return on capital. So, one silver lining is that this could be another step forward in conditioning consumers to not wait for discounts. The risk? People spend their money on something else, i.e., consumption shifts elsewhere and it does not all come back when supply resumes. The larger companies, which our global portfolios tend to own, have the scale to weather the storm and to continue investing in their digital platforms; however, smaller companies, which were already playing catch up, may find themselves further behind in the digital race. The rush to \u201cnot miss out\u201d on demand creates environmental, social and governance risks, as well. There are well-documented supply chain controversies for the sporting goods industry; its constituents need to be careful not to add to the list with the pressure to ramp up production quickly while balancing labour welfare. This could be a good test of how much progress a company has made in making people a priority in their way of doing business. \u00d7 \" There is no easy fix to the semiconductor shortage \u2013 it can only be addressed by new manufacturing capacity Of course, while sporting goods are a recent victim, semiconductors were perhaps the earliest category where there was a clear mismatch in supply and demand. Here, increased demand as a result of COVID-19 (working from home, home schooling, etc.) hit up against relatively fixed near-term supply. This has had a knock-on effect in many parts of the economy, most notably stalling the automotive sector, which goes to show just how pervasive technology is becoming within the global economy. There is no easy fix to the semiconductor shortage \u2013 it can only be addressed by new manufacturing capacity. Here the leading Taiwanese foundry has indicated it will invest $100 billion over the next three years. The shortage has also shone a light on just how narrow and globalised the semiconductor supply chain has become, with capacity provided by only a handful of major chipmakers and equipment manufacturers. \u00d7 \" Pricing power is vital For companies with pricing power, cost inflation can be passed on to the end customer. The strong demand environment today means many companies, even those with historically weak pricing power, are confident they can pass on cost increases, minimising the impact on profits. The difference is, for those with weak pricing power, pricing may not stick once this period of supply squeeze abates. Pricing power is a vital attribute we seek in the companies we own in our global portfolios. So, while there may be some short-term volatility for their earnings and returns, we think the earnings potential of these higher quality companies should be rebased higher once this episode is complete, and the gap between the high quality and low quality companies widened. \u00d7 Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy\u2019s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 Nathan Wong Executive Director International Equity Team Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/supply-chain-squeeze.html"}
{"content": "With U.S. inflation accelerating to its highest rate in a decade, near-term uncertainties related to the pace of interest rate hikes and the impact on earnings are top of mind for many credit investors. \u00d7 Based on underlying sector trends, we see this current period of accelerating inflation as part of an economic expansionary phase that could lead to a more sustained global recovery and GDP growth over time. When we look at the effects of inflation on credit profiles by sector, we can examine the impact of wage inflation as well as higher commodity and input costs on the earnings and cash flow trajectory. Undoubtedly, the supply shock created by the pandemic has led to higher prices. Across industries, supply-chain disruptions and longer-term strategic shifts to bring manufacturing onshore have strained resources, causing input prices to rise. We believe these are durable factors that can exert upward pricing pressure and drive so-called cost-push inflation. But this is more than just a supply shock. We also observe a substantial recovery in demand across sectors. Importantly, we expect that to grow for a variety of reasons, consistent with an economic expansion. That can also exert upward price pressures, so-called demand-pull inflation. \u00d7 Display 1: U.S. inflation ticks up \uf065 Source: Morgan Stanley, as of September 30, 2021. \u00d7 Display 1: U.S. inflation ticks up Source: Morgan Stanley, as of September 30, 2021. First the good news: Sectors with a chance to win Inflation is broadly positive for Banks based on the prospect of higher rates. While Banks face some wage inflation and cost pressure, their record deposits and low defaults suggest that any impact on earnings would be more of an equity story. It\u2019s important to note that rate hikes may not automatically translate to a tightening in monetary conditions, since a true tightening only occurs when the real policy rate exceeds the neutral policy rate. In the U.S., the real policy rate could remain negative and below the neutral policy rate over the next few years. We base this assessment on the Federal Reserve\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections from September, with the real policy rate projected to be negative at -0.35% \u2014 calculated as the Fed\u2019s 2024 median projected nominal policy rate of 1.75% minus projected inflation of 2.1% \u2014 versus the estimated neutral rate of 0%. All else equal, therefore, we believe the aggregate impact of higher rates on Banks\u2019 credit profile may be positive at least through 2024. Elsewhere in the sector, Insurers can pass through some higher labor and commodity costs in higher premiums for consumers, subject to regulatory caps. REITs generally have inflation-linked rent escalators that are pass-through in nature, leaving their credit profile unchanged. In Industrials, pockets of cost-push inflation may tilt earnings to the negative. However, green shoots of demand-pull inflation, coupled with rational behavior among producers, would be broadly supportive of the credit profile. Demand is healthy, bolstered by the macro trends of accelerated digital transformation and a sustained focus on increasing productivity. Semiconductors in particular exhibit strong growth across key end markets, including Computing, Wireless, Industrials and Consumer, and we expect double-digit growth from Automotive specifically. From an ESG standpoint, Semiconductors are essential to improving the efficiency of end products and enabling the transition from analog to digital interfaces. Therefore, higher Semiconductor prices are likely to persist without comprising growth. We think chip manufacturers will continue to enjoy significant pricing power as long as demand outpaces supply. Energy is another sector with positive momentum. The United States is one of the world\u2019s largest oil producers and has been disciplined on adding supply lately, though not always historically. At present, U.S. producers are unlikely to flood the market even in an inflationary environment for a variety of reasons, including supply chain issues and labor shortages in Oil Field Services. Rising energy prices generally lead to improving cash flow for the producers. Pipelines still have substantial capacity to meet incremental demand. Midstream assets typically have pass-through triggers in contracts that are effectively dealing with COVID-related supply chain and inflationary pressures. There are some regional differences to highlight for this sector. Natural Gas prices are up 200% to 300% year to date in Europe and Asia, mostly spiking in the past three months, compared to 125% in the U.S.1 As a fallout of these differences, we will likely see curtailments of Agricultural Chemicals in Europe, whereas U.S.- based producers are seeing tailwinds from price expansion. Government intervention in Europe \u2014 aimed at controlling supply and production while alleviating the impact for consumers on fixed incomes \u2014 is a headwind for corporates. For example, Spain has already increased taxes and directed Utilities to pass earnings toconsumers, which is another negative for the sector credit profile. Derivative products in Specialty Chemicals and Packaging, where pricing power is more limited, should nonetheless see long-term positives from higher prices, but there could be a two to three quarter lag of significant margin pressure. We expect metals to see positive inflationary effects, as end demand is strong and the sector benefits from pricing power. A caveat is that China\u2019s Evergrande poses potential spillover risk for Steel and Iron Ore demand. Global underinvestment in infrastructure for commodities has been significant for a long time, so any pickup in demand could easily create supply shortages and drive up prices quickly. These are all supportive trends for earnings, cash flow and the overall credit profile. Higher inflation has boosted top lines among Automakers despite the lagging effect of higher commodity costs \u2014 for example, steel prices are often locked in several quarters in advance. We see signs of inflation most acutely in Used Vehicles, where prices continue to march higher, benefiting companies\u2019 finance income. While the semiconductor chip shortage weighs on OEMs, the overall trend is improving. Notably semiconductor chips currently make up less than 5% of costs for EVs, compared to more than 40% for Mobile Phones and Solar.Automakers see better revenue and margins from higher new vehicle prices and the strong price and product mix, aided by factors including fiscal stimulus and accommodating monetary policy, in conjunction with the reopening of the economy. \u00d7 Not all the news is positive: Sectors under pressure Consumers may see a net negative impact from inflationary trends, although wage growth and high personal saving rates may help to offset this, at least in part. Consumer Products, as a whole, face headwinds from commodity inflation in the low single digits. If not addressed by existing hedging strategies, most of this can be expected to pass through to consumers directly in the form of higher finished goods prices. Retailers will seek to protect already thin margins and continue to pass additional costs to consumers. Reopening post-COVID has led to labor shortages, requiring somewhat higher salaries and wages to entice workers back. Teenagers are filling some of the jobs, however, which is keeping a lid on wages relative to other industries. Gaming, Leisure and Lodging are broadly correlated with consumer spending. We expect pent-up demand from reopening and unspent stimulus dollars, which should at least partially offset the negative impact of higher food, rent, service and energy costs on purchasing power. Utilities have regulatory protections to offset rising costs. For example, higher fuel costs can be passed to consumers through fuel and purchased power adjustment clauses, outside of a general rate case. While rising operation and maintenance costs unrelated to fuel could impact the overall bottom line, expectations are for utilities to continue their cost-cutting measures and file more frequent rate cases to offset these. Defense and Transports have fixed contracts, which are thus exposed to higher costs on existing commitments that may also have long lead times \u2014 posing a risk that is a potential negative for both earnings and cash flow. In Diversified Industrials, higher raw material, packaging and logistics costs continue to pressure margins and eat into the savings that some companies realized during the pandemic. Among Consumer Non-Cyclicals, we are watching out for legislative scrutiny of the practice of increasing drug list prices. Any forthcoming action could negatively affect the long-term pricing power of Pharmaceuticals. Healthcare has been contending with deflationary pressures, given scrutiny over rising costs as a percentage of GDP and the ongoing transition to value-based care. Telecom and Media face a similar neutral theme, where competition will likely continue to keep prices lower, but we expect limited impact on earnings, cash flow and credit profile for this cohort. \u00d7 Challenges and Opportunities Remain As always, changes in the macroeconomic environment present both challenges and opportunities. Today, the big change is inflation and how companies adjust to this risk. The elements of cost-push inflation that exist today may cause stress in some corporate sectors. Companies whose earnings, cash flows and profits are tied to factors that are fixed \u2014 and where both rising input costs and the inability to pass through high prices can squeeze margins \u2014 will face challenges. On the other hand, there are companies that can address rising demand more efficiently, adjust prices more quickly, pass through higher costs and increase productivity. They may observe benefits to their earnings, cash flow and profit margins. The opportunities lie in selecting sectors, and more specifically companies, that are best able to adjust, adapt and innovate during a changing environment. \u00d7 Risk Considerations Diversification neither assures a profit nor guarantees against loss in a declining market. There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. \u00d7 INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RESEARCH TEAM \u00d7", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/credit-markets-brace-for-inflation.html"}
{"content": "The strong post-2020 economic recovery has led to a new era ruled by rising yields and higher inflation. Going forward, we believe it will be critical to invest in areas of fixed income that may be less impacted by rising rates. In our view, the Morgan Stanley Global Fixed Income Opportunities Fund is well-positioned for this environment. \u00d7 The Fund\u2019s unconstrained approach aims to decorrelate from the interest rate cycle to generate alpha\u2014which is particularly beneficial in a rising rates environment. Due to its flexible mandate, the Fund is both able to help preserve capital and generate alpha by tactically reducing duration amid rising rates via active duration and curve management. Currently, the Fund currently has approximately 3 years of duration. Our asset selection within the spread sectors, particularly higher yielding credits, should also help offset any further rise in rates. Within high yield, we continue to favor lower credit quality, primarily single Bs vs. BBs as high yield typically outperforms investment grade rated bonds in recovery periods. Given default rates have plunged, we believe allocating to lower quality bonds is beneficial for additional yield pick-up. Lower rated B rated bonds tend to outperform BBs if default risk continues to decline and investors reach for yield down the credit curve. Conversely, we believe avoiding low coupon, long duration BB credits should help mitigate the risk from a move higher in rates. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Morgan Stanley Global Fixed Income Opportunities Fund: Portfolio Positioning \uf065 Subject to change daily.

The Global Fixed Income Team\u2019s Views on Inflation The global economic recovery has been underwritten by expectations of continued fiscal and monetary policy support. Inflation has surged to multi-year highs, but most of this increase is expected to be transitory, and not something central banks have said they will respond to. However, there is a risk that they will change their mind, both because the inflation figures have been far stronger than expected, and because there is a risk that the inflation shock turns out to be more persistent than expected. While inflation has continued to surprise to the upside, it is still our view that the surge is mainly transitory due to base effects, higher commodity prices, temporary bottlenecks in the economy and statistical issues. However, we expect the current high elevated inflation to continue, with year-over-year rates beginning to decline in 2H22. In the coming months, we also expect central banks to begin to slow or will have announced their intention to begin slowing asset purchases. Nevertheless, there is a risk that inflation is persistently higher going forward due to: 1) higher housing and accommodation costs, which tend to be sticky; 2) higher wages and labor costs, due to the economic scarring from COVID (lower participation rates); and 3) higher inflation expectations. Even if inflation, and inflation expectations, just return to 2010-15 levels, this should cause a significant repricing in fixed income markets. Components of inflation like shelter/ accommodation costs and other prices that have historically been \u201csticky\u201d (i.e., do not fluctuate much) have started to increase (Display 3). If price levels remain sticky, then this may drive wages higher that may create inflation risks longer term. Display 4 conveys that the average weekly earnings are rising, especially for lower-paid workers due to the shortages of workers (particularly in the services industries). In fact, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta shows that median hourly wages for people in the bottom 25 percent of earners have risen at a 4.6 percent rate in the past year, compared to 2.8 percent for the top 25 percent.1 Furthermore, the Fed\u2019s index of common inflation expectations (CIE) is now slightly above the 2 percent levels, after staying well below persistently prior to the recent surge in inflation risks (Display 5). If the inflation shock persists, there is a risk that bond yields will start to rise. However, for now, the backdrop for the U.S. Treasury (UST) market remains sanguine. We believe for most of 2H21 we will see UST 10y yields in a range between 1.75% and 2.00%. We believe the surge in yields is likely behind us, with the peaks in growth, inflation and rate of fiscal spending seen in 1H21. Now, with the peaks likely behind us, the base effects for growth, inflation and fiscal spending will be harder to surpass and represent a de facto tightening of support programs and facilities. Additionally, tapering of asset purchases will begin in the U.S. in November, as expected. \u00d7 DISPLAY 3: The inflation shock may not be transitory: U.S. shelter inflation \uf065 Source: MSIM, Bloomberg.

{"content": "A key question hanging over financial markets is: how hard will central banks push back against inflation? Inflation has continually surprised to the upside, even if it is no longer surging higher in year-on-year terms. Developed market central banks had until recently remained calm, accepting that most of the shock was likely transitory due to supply chain and labor market disruptions, and large shifts in aggregate demand to goods from services. Being unusually sanguine, they talked dovishly, remained focused on downside risks and hoped it would sort itself out before transitory morphed into troubling. No more. Bond markets, but surprisingly not equity markets, were rocked in October by hawkish shifts in central bank policy and rhetoric and aggressive repricing of rate expectations. The era of central bank passivity has come to a close, and policy normalization has begun. First the Norwegian central bank raised rates in September. Removing accommodation no longer needed was the justification. Then two weeks later the New Zealand central bank in early October raised rates, in a more hawkish fashion, meaning this was the first of potentially many rate hikes. The initial view was they\u2019re small countries and markets did not think they mattered too much. But then the Bank of Canada on October 27th suddenly, seemingly out of the blue, ended quantitative easing (QE) and announced rates would likely be hiked mid-2022, almost a year sooner than expected. This was compounded by credible talk from the Bank of England that they would raise rates in November, and the Australian central bank failed to defend their yield curve control policy, sending yields up 62 basis points (bps) in three days! In a country where the central bank has adamantly insisted rates would not rise at all until 2024! Of course, it did not help that the Fed was meeting in the first week of November where they were highly likely to confirm (which they did) ending their emergency QE programs, which sent U.S. short-maturity yields significantly higher. \u00d7 What to make of all this? Normalization is the new mantra. The need for emergency levels of accommodation are broadly thought to be no longer necessary, especially with growth above trend in 2021/22 and inflation proving to be potentially more than transitory. However, normalization is not tightening. It is removing unnecessary accommodation and getting policy back to a more neutral setting. As such, for most countries, like the UK, Eurozone, Canada, and most importantly the U.S., we should not expect their central banks to tighten policy aggressively; they are more likely to take a more leisurely approach to policy adjustments than the market currently expects. In the case of Australia, if the Reserve Bank is any good at forecasting its own policy, interest rates have well overshot. Emerging markets (EM) are another story with significant hikes occurring and no end in sight as inflation has become even more intransigent in countries like Poland, Czech, Russia, Mexico and Brazil. As such EM local markets have had a horrid time as monetary policy tightenings have been big and unrelenting (and as of yet no letup in inflation pressures). Therefore, we expect DM central banks to proceed slowly and with caution, and yes monetary policy angst is overdone. But this could still lead to volatility in markets, depending on what investors expect. Markets initially aggressively priced the beginning of rate hiking cycles, much more than most central banks thought appropriate. Indeed, the most egregious sell offs in front ends of yield curves are already correcting themselves. We expect the total amount of tightening to remain modest as, again, most developed market central banks do not want restrictive policies: they simply want less accommodative policies. However, if investors (or central banks) change their mind on this, for example because higher inflation appears to become more entrenched and the economy remains resilient, bond yields might need to rise considerably. In credit markets, spreads are still below long-term averages despite recent volatility; this seems justified given the benign economic outlook and stronger corporate and household balance sheets, but even a minor deterioration in credit conditions could impact valuations. Of course, the \u201ccentral bank put\u201d could still come into play, with tightening measures delayed or cancelled if markets wobble too much, but the pace of normalization will primarily depend on the state of the economy. In terms of our market views, we have generally been reducing portfolio risk given the uncertain outlook. We remain long risky assets (corporate credit, securitized credit, emerging markets) because of the positive economic outlook and strong fundamentals, and in spite of credit spreads being tight relative to history. We expect government bond yields to drift higher as we move towards tighter monetary policy, but it will be a \u201clong and winding road\u201d. \u00d7 Display 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date \uf065 Note: USD-based performance.

Fixed Income Outlook October was an extraordinary month in terms of bond market volatility. While longer-maturity yields remained well anchored, short-maturity yields skyrocketed as central banks began to reduce accommodation. Through the first half of the month, longer-maturity yields generally rose as anxiety rose about inflation.1 Transitory was not turning out to be so transitory, and even if transitory, it had risen so high that, even if it came down substantially, it would still be too high for policymaker\u2019s comfort at the end of 2022. Moreover, economic data was generally underperforming, whether it be labor markets, industrial production or consumption. While a lot of this uncomfortable mix could be blamed on supply side woes, it still put central banks in an uncomfortable position which troubled investors. Starting in September, central banks in Norway, New Zealand, the UK, Canada, and Australia all did or said things which unnerved bond markets. With the Fed announcing the end of its QE program next year, and the ECB expected to do so in December, markets had additional reasons to worry. If central banks tightened global liquidity conditions too quickly, it could undercut the economy and make the current slowdown in growth (mostly supply side driven) worse, undermining risky assets such as high yield and equities while helping long maturity risk free bonds. Short maturity bond yields shot higher over the last week of October and early November. Significant increases in official rates were forecasted in many countries. For example, over the next 12 months, markets expect central banks to hike rates in New Zealand (180 bps); Norway (100 bps); Canada (120 bps); UK (90 bps); Australia (80 bps); U.S. (45 bps); ECB (10 bps). These numbers have come down from their peaks a week ago but still look uniformly high; not impossible, just improbable. And remember that, for example, the RBA has emphasized it has no intention of raising rates until at least the second half of 2023! A long way off. It is also hard to believe that the industrial world can hike rates by this much if the Fed and ECB remain on the dovish end of the spectrum. Indeed, these predictions are higher than the respective central banks are predicting. In particular, the Fed continues to emphasize they have not achieved their labor market goals and will not hike at all until labor markets tighten further as measured by a combination of employment, unemployment rate, participation rates and inclusiveness. If the Fed and the ECB execute according to their forecasts it is very unlikely the other central banks will be able to pull away from the Fed/ECB/BoJ peloton. Thus, we believe the market overreacted to central bank actions and we do not believe in the stagflation narrative. Growth is likely to rebound in Q4 (Eurozone has its supply side and COVID issues) and inflation is likely to stay high if not go higher still. October Purchasing Managers' Index (PMIs) showed a strong post-delta wave recovery in services with supply disruptions continuing to hold back manufacturing. Asia is doing better, and the latest U.S. employment report was quite positive although supply issues continue to hold down the participation rate. Moreover, global household savings remain elevated and financial conditions are easy and will remain easy even if there is modest central bank tightening whether through tapering or elimination of QE or actual rate hikes. This relative sanguine monetary policy outlook is not without risk. Inflationary pressures are not abating or at least not fast enough. Worries about second round effects and surging housing markets worry central banks. The most recent surge has come from higher energy prices (especially European natural gas prices), but the pressure is more broad-based: many other commodities (e.g., food, a particular concern for EM central banks) are also at multi-year highs; COVID-induced bottlenecks continue to cause shortages in many consumer goods supply chains, and there are widespread reports of labor shortages across developed economies. It is currently unclear just how persistent, or permanent, many of these issues are, but what is certain is that the current surge in inflation is expected to last longer than previously thought, with economists now forecasting it will only return to more normal levels towards second half of 2022. Thus, the need for central banks to play defense, engage in risk mitigation strategies which imply reduced accommodation. Going forward we expect central banks to move slowly and deliberately, look through high headline inflation, and avoid doing anything to suggest policy needs to be \u201ctight\u201d rather than just less easy. But, with all central banks thinking along the same lines (to varying degrees), it is easy for individual central banks to hike rates under cover of the central bank \u201cpeloton.\u201d As long as no one gets too far out in front, it will be easier for the global central banking community to collectively move rates higher. Currently, markets expect a quick hiking cycle to lower than historic peak rates. The risk to bond valuations comes more from the length of the hiking cycle and the eventual terminal policy rate not as much about the pace (although that matters for the shape of the curve). But if the market starts expecting a more normal central bank cycle, then yields could rise further. Credit investors have also become more nervous recently, causing credit spreads to widen; we think this is mainly reflective of how tight spreads had become rather than any meaningful increase in default risk or deteriorating fundamentals. Where does this leave our views on markets? In general, we remain overweight the riskier, cyclical sectors but we have been reducing risk at the margin given valuations and increased volatility/uncertainty. On government bonds, we expect yields to drift higher at the longer end of yield curves, but this is likely to be a long laborious process given high global liquidity/savings and a likely slow tightening cycle. That said, low expected terminal rates and highly negative real yields make longer-maturity bonds relatively unappealing. Shorter maturity bonds are more interesting due to much higher risk premiums now priced in. We remain overweight corporate and securitized credit, particularly lower quality investment grade bonds and selective high yield and are overweight in selective emerging markets (like Egypt and Dominican Republic), where there are, in our view, idiosyncratic reasons to be bullish. Developed Market (DM) Rate/Foreign Currency (FX) Monthly Review Government bond yields rose modestly as inflation expectations continued to rise. Given growth also remains above average, central banks are increasingly moving towards reducing monetary accommodation. Markets began to price in a more aggressive timeline for policy tightening across the developed markets, but long dated government bonds remain rich vs. history.2 Outlook The combination of above average growth and elevated inflation is likely to cause central banks to move towards tightening. While much of the increase in inflation is expected to be transitory, it has already proven to be more persistent than expected and the risks are skewed towards it staying higher for longer. This is likely to put upward pressure on government bond yields, especially given rich valuations. However, we also think markets have priced in too much central bank tightening in the short term. Emerging Market (EM) Rate/FX Monthly Review EM debt returns were negative in October. Hard currency was flat. EM Corporates returns were negative for the month, with high yield underperforming investment grade corporates. Local currency bonds posted negative returns, primarily due to higher yields.3 Suriname, Sri Lanka, Belize and El Salvador were the best performers in October, while bonds from Lebanon, Argentina and Ethiopia were laggards. From a sectoral perspective, Metals &amp; Mining and TMT companies led the market, while those in the Real Estate, Pulp &amp; Paper and Consumer sectors lagged.4 Outlook We have a cautious stance towards Emerging Market debt, as the asset class continues to face multiple disruptive forces, despite valuations being generally attractive. We favor a subset of EM High Yield credits featuring positive idiosyncratic stories, relatively solid fiscal stances, and/or exposed to higher oil prices (similarly, in EMFX). In rates, we prefer yield curves that are already pricing in aggressive monetary policy tightening. Credit Monthly Review Credit spreads over the month were a touch wider through the month. Sector and corporate news in the month was dominated by Q3 reporting where the banks outperformed supported by non-performing loan provision write backs and non-financials focused on the impact of higher cost inflation with the majority exceeding expectations reduced in late summer citing pricing power to pass on cost increases. M&amp;A remained a topic of continued speculation supported by low costs of debt. Global convertibles performed in between equity and credit in October as the Refinitv Global Convertibles Focus Index rose compared to MSCI Global equities and the Barclays Global Credit index. Outlook We see credit as fully valued but likely to consolidate at current levels supported by (1) financial conditions remaining easy, supporting low default rates (2) economic activity that continues to rebound as vaccinations allow economies to re-open (3) strong corporate profitability with conservative balance sheet management as overall uncertainty remains high; and (4) demand for credit to stay strong as excess liquidity looks to be invested. We expect good ability to earn attractive carry but see limited opportunities for capital gains from spread tightening. Securitized Products Monthly Review Securitized markets were choppy in October. Performance seemed to be more a function of liquidity and depth of sponsorship rather than specific credit concerns. New issuance remained high and secondary trading increased materially in October while sectors with historically lighter sponsorship seemed to buckle under supply pressure.[5] Agency MBS performed very well in October, especially considering the curve flattening and upcoming Fed taper expectations.6 U.S. Non-agency RMBS spreads had very mixed performances while U.S. CMBS spreads widened in October.7 U.S. ABS spreads were mixed as well in October, with consumer and auto loans performing well, while spreads in less liquid sections such as mortgage servicing rights and aircraft ABS widened.8 European RMBS, CMBS and ABS activity remained high in October and European spreads remained steady.9 Outlook We expect market activity to begin to slow in November. Higher rates, wider spreads and approaching year-end could cool overall activity levels. Credit fundamentals should remain very solid, especially for residential and consumer assets. European securitized markets should remain well supported by the historically low rates in Europe and by the asset purchase programs and lending programs of the ECB and BOE. \u00d7 1 Source: Bloomberg.

There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. \u00d7 Global Fixed Income Team Our fixed income investment capabilities are driven by eight specialized teams \u2013 Agency MBS, Emerging Markets, Floating-Rate Loans, High Yield, Investment Grade Credit, Municipals, Multi-Sector, and Securitized \u2013 which span the global fixed income capital markets.

{"content": "Markets bounced back strongly in October with the S&amp;P 500 and MSCI Europe Index up 7.0% (USD) and 4.7% (EUR) respectively1. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index was also up 1.0% (USD)1. In contrast, the MSCI Japan Index was down over the month at -1.2% (JPY)1. Energy continued to be the best performing sector, with the MSCI ACWI Energy Index up 6.4% (USD)1, on the back of rising prices and persistent supply bottlenecks. As markets recovered, the VIX moved down to 162 by month end. \u00d7 Rising Energy prices\u2026cause of worry? The origin of recent rises in gas prices in Europe can be traced back to higher than average consumption last winter, leading to depleted storage inventories across Europe. Additionally, inadequate supply from Russia in 2021 has exacerbated the situation. With winter approaching, further strain on supply from a colder than average winter could keep gas prices at elevated levels. However, the impact of higher gas prices on consumer spending and growth should be limited due to the lagged and partial pass-through to energy bills across European countries, along with notably elevated pent-up savings level of consumers. Moreover, we expect that additional supply from Russia will ease the squeeze in the coming months, further suggesting that the impact on inflation and growth should be limited. Central Banks start to scale back accommodation US 10-Year Treasury rates continued to move up from 1.5%2 at the end of September to close the month at 1.55%2. The FOMC\u2019s slight hawkish tilt in September indicated a desire for a somewhat quicker pace towards policy normalisation as inflation upside risks persist. If supply bottlenecks and rising energy prices continue to feed through to higher costs of living and eventually wage inflation, we may be nearing the end of the Fed\u2019s wait-and-see approach. Although we expect the Fed to announce tapering in November and to conclude it by the middle of 2022, the overall policy will likely continue to remain accommodative. We expect rates to likely continue to grind modestly higher, but believe they will settle at lower levels than in previous cycles. There are indications that fixed income investors are becoming more concerned about inflation risk, however, which could increase the pace of central bank normalisation. China Property Risks: Systemic or idiosyncratic? Although some of the highly indebted Chinese property companies have continued to make global headlines throughout October, the risk of a global systemic shock remains remote in our view. While China is currently suffering from multiple headwinds, we think the government possesses the willingness and appropriate policy tools (e.g. cutting the required reserves ratio, increased fiscal spending, quicker loan approvals and lowering the down payment ratio and mortgage costs) to lend strong support to the property sector and stabilise the wider economy at this stage. We should expect some power rationing to continue during Q4, but aggressive reforms already introduced by some key ministries offer the opportunity of easing supply chain pressures and more stable prices in key commodities over the coming months. Investment implications As a result of the recent low realised market volatility, we fine-tuned our portfolios, increasing equity exposure mid-month to ensure that our portfolios continue to be in line with their respective risk-targets. The abatement of risk from near-term events like the FOMC meeting in September and the subsequent minutes published in mid-October, also provided support. That said, we are keeping an eye on the expected Fed tapering plan and announcement next month. We remain underweight duration as fixed income valuations still appear rich given the constructive macro backdrop and the potential reversal of the support provided to duration by some technical factors in Q3.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser\u2019s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio\u2019s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio\u2019s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. \u00d7 Andrew Harmstone Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Manfred Hui Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Select Product(s) Right Click Edit", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/winds-are-changing.html"}

{"content": "Higher than expected inflation has caught the attention of global central banks and bond markets. With developed and emerging market economies beginning to tighten monetary policy, short-term rates have increased, helping to drive yield curves flatter. Technical factors played a role as well, and we believe the back end of the curve could move higher as the economy continues to expand and the Powell Fed remains dovish and focused on full employment. We reiterate our preference for credit over duration in fixed income portfolios. \u00d7 Since mid-September, the 2-year Treasury yield more than doubled to 50 basis points (bps), as markets aggressively pulled forward rate hike expectations ahead of a highly anticipated November FOMC meeting. Headline CPI inflation above 6% has the market beginning to believe the Fed will be forced to raise rates sooner than expected. While the Fed acknowledged the \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d required to begin tapering QE bond purchases, Chair Powell pushed back against market expectations for multiple interest rate hikes in 2022. Powell has consistently noted a higher bar for raising interest rates while trying to divorce the start of tapering from the start of tightening. During the press conference, he suggested it won\u2019t be until next summer before we can truly discern the long- term inflation trends from Covid and supply chain issues. The implication is the Fed has redefined transitory inflation and is still willing to let inflation temporarily run hot as they believe many of the supply chain issues are Covid related and will get sorted out next year. This should support a steeper curve, while running the risk they may have to tighten more abruptly in the future. The market continues to challenge the Fed in the front of the curve as the inflation data remains persistent at the highest levels seen in 30 years. However, yields in the back end of the Treasury curve have barely moved and seem to be ignoring inflation. 10-year Treasury bond yields have been in a range of 1.25%- 1.75% since the end of the first quarter. We think some of the reasons the long end has been well-behaved have been technical in nature. Large pension fund inflows, foreign buying and unwinds of levered hedge fund carry and curve trades have all produced buying out on the curve. Rebounding economic data could support higher interest rates as Delta cases have slowed in the U.S. and the economy has continued adding jobs. The Citi U.S. Economic Surprise Index (Display 1), measuring economic data relative to expectations, has again returned to positive territory. October\u2019s strong monthly job gains included upward revisions to prior months. After initial estimates of 6-7% GDP growth, we saw soft economic data drag down 3rd quarter GDP to 2% as the Delta variant spread this summer. Since Labor Day, Covid cases in the U.S. have been cut in half and vaccines for children and more effective therapeutics are currently hitting the market. After disappointing in the 3rd quarter on Delta variant supply chain woes, we expect GDP to bounce back in the 4th quarter and remain above trend in 2022. The average 2022 GDP target is 4% according to Bloomberg, with Morgan Stanley economists calling for 4.6% in 2022 and 3% in 2023. \u00d7 Display 1: The Citi U.S. Economic Surprise Index returns to positive territory \uf065 Source: Bloomberg as of October 31, 2021. \u00d7 Display 1: The Citi U.S. Economic Surprise Index returns to positive territory Source: Bloomberg as of October 31, 2021. The summer also produced a strange cocktail of technical factors supporting Treasuries that could abate later this year. Tax season was pushed out from April until June. The debt ceiling debate caused the Treasury General Account to run down, reducing the supply of T-Bills. And the Fed is now tapering purchases of Treasuries and Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) by 15 billion per month. As the debt ceiling is resolved and infrastructure bills make their way through Congress, net supply could shift from a tailwind to a headwind for Treasuries. For investors searching for yield and income, we still prefer an overweight to credit and default risk while remaining underweight duration risk. This trade has worked well in 2021 and continues to benefit from strong corporate and municipal fundamentals. Investors can also look for opportunities in extending from money market funds to short-duration bond funds that have started to reflect future rate hikes and higher yields. While yield curves may steepen, excess global liquidity and persistent demand from pension funds and foreign buyers should keep a lid on long end yields. The technical bid to the long end of the market cannot be ignored, despite growth and inflationary pressures in the economy. As equity markets rally (S&amp;P 500 +25% YTD), pension funds are becoming fully funded and can defease their liabilities by purchasing high quality long duration bonds. The demographic trend of retiring baby boomers favors fixed income allocations as well. Weekly bond fund and ETF fixed income in flows have remained robust. For foreign investors, U.S. rates remain a bargain relative to the negative sovereign yields seen throughout Japan and Europe. With $12 trillion in negative-yielding securities globally,1 and the world awash in central bank and government liquidity, high quality U.S. fixed income assets should continue to see demand. In sum, even though we anticipate higher trend growth and inflation data leading to higher long-term interest rates, we think higher yields will still be met with many buyers which should limit the ceiling for long-term yields. For investors, a key debate surrounds Powell\u2019s ability to remain patient as politically unpopular inflation continues into 2022. With above trend inflation data continuing to roll in, markets could again attempt to test the Fed\u2019s resolve. The next update will be the FOMC meeting on December 15th when the committee releases its latest Summary of Economic Projections and dot-plot. This will be the opportunity for the hawkish wing of the committee to demonstrate the extent of their divergence with Powell, and it should be closely scrutinized by market participants for signs of a potential shift. Municipals: \u201cFuture Hindsight\u201d \u201cHindsight is 20/20\u201d is the simple acknowledgement that prior actions may have been different had future outcomes been known at the time. While this seems incredibly obvious, it speaks to last summer\u2019s press that implied that bond purchases made years ago now look great today. Indeed, articles such as these tend to appear whenever municipal bonds are perceived to be fully valued\u2026or even overvalued. They also dovetail with our longstanding opinion that during such frothy periods \u201cthe best thing about munis is already owning them.\u201d The real question is how to attain this \u201cfuture hindsight.\u201d While the path and trajectory of U.S. interest rates remains an open question, fueled by each data release and periodic FOMC rhetoric, the municipal bond market does offer clues as to how it may outperform or underperform within the broader context of the trajectory of U.S. Treasury (UST) yields during certain seasons. Indeed, the tax-exempt muni market is frequently impacted by powerful factors, referred to as \u201ctechnicals,\u201d that can acutely alter the balance of supply and demand in the municipal bond market. In fact, our runner-up title to this section was \u201cIt\u2019s Technical.\u201d Let\u2019s examine. With the summer season in the rearview mirror, many students are back to school, workers back in the office, investors appear to be reengaged, and municipal bond issuers (states, counties and local municipalities) have been back in the market issuing bonds. While most bond market participants rightfully have an intense interest in economic data, Fed rhetoric regarding the timing of \u201cliftoff\u201d (a raising of interest rates) and the related response in UST yields, municipal money managers and muni pundits have an additional interest in shifting technical factors that routinely appear in a seasonal fashion. With an impressive ten months already in the books and a YTD Bloomberg total return that made it the envy of fixed income, the tax-exempt muni market cruised through the summer flush with cash, but with few bonds to satisfy that demand, only to encounter the fall headwinds of rising UST yields, weaker demand and greater supply. The total return for the Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index was +1.12% on November 22. Admittedly, a one percent gain does not appear compelling, but compared to YTD negative total returns for U.S. Treasuries (-2.93%), securitized (-1.26%) and investment grade corporate (-1.73%) Bloomberg indices, it\u2019s relatively impressive. That said, the tax-exempt muni sands shifted in both September and October to the benefit of prospective buyers. After three months of outsized demand from bond redemptions and constrained new issue supply due to light summer issuance, these technical factors, which often dictate the degree to which the muni market will outperform or underperform corresponding maturity USTs, reversed in September and October. This shift endured into early-November. Driving the fall price weakness is a positive net supply of bonds, weaker (sub- $500mm) mutual fund inflows and the formidable headwind of weaker USTs. In fact, June, July and August represented the three largest months of bond redemptions (maturities, coupons and calls) hitting bondholder accounts this year \u2026 and September was the smallest! After the residual monies from the summer reinvestment demand were deployed, there was little left in the pipeline. Specifically, total redemptions declined from approximately $47 billion in August to just over $22 billion for September, and remain at reduced levels through November, as illustrated in Display 2. \u00d7 Display 2: Total muni redemptions dropped significantly in the fall of 2021 \uf065 Source: ICE Data, as of September 30, 2021. \u00d7 Display 2: Total muni redemptions dropped significantly in the fall of 2021 Source: ICE Data, as of September 30, 2021. Meanwhile, new issuance supply typically increases during the fall months of October and November. This combination of increasing supply and decreasing reinvestment demand marked a reversal of the recent market-favorable technicals and spelled opportunity for those patiently awaiting a better buying environment\u2026especially given recently higher benchmark yields. Display 3 illustrates average muni issuance, by month, over the last 20 years. \u00d7 Display 3: New muni issuance supply typically increases in October and November \uf065 Source: The Bond Buyer, as of September 30, 2021 \u00d7 Display 3: New muni issuance supply typically increases in October and November Source: The Bond Buyer, as of September 30, 2021 What we watch for\u2026 and what we are seeing Like most fixed income investors, we are keeping a close eye on economic data, specifically the monthly payroll situation reports, as well as rhetoric and data from the FOMC regarding the timing of an eventual \u201clift-off\u201d following the proposed end of tapering in June of 2022. On the tax-exempt municipal front, we are seeing a relatively consistent rise in new issue supply, as well as more attractive munirelative value ratios versus corresponding maturity USTs (75% on 11/09 versus an average of 67% year-to-date for the 10-year benchmark). There are a number of muni-specific or muni-impactful \u201cknown unknowns\u201d in play today: a possible cap adjustment on state and local property tax deductions (SALT); the potential advance refunding capability using tax exempts for municipal issuers; the possibility of a return of a Build America Bonds-style taxable muni program. Yet despite these market uncertainties we remain optimistic about the tax-exempt muni asset class due to what we believe will be a continued environment of robust demand and constrained supply. There is also the real possibility of higher upper-bracket income tax rates, which may provide a strong tailwind for individual investor demand. What about rising rates? Our upbeat outlook notwithstanding, we do acknowledge that rates are expected to rise in the coming months (and beyond), given Morgan Stanley\u2019s forecast of 1.80% for the 10-year UST by year-end, and 2% for the end of 2Q 2022. Additionally, the street consensus also has rates rising, though less dramatically, with year-end forecasts for the 10-year UST that average 1.69% according to Bloomberg (as of 11.09.21). As of this writing the 10-year UST stands at approximately 1.65% (Bloomberg). That said, we find it helpful to discuss the prospect of rising muni yields using the Morgan Stanley forecasts as benchmarks to apply various muni-relative value scenarios, which enables us to provide potential paths for muni yields (Display 4 below). For context, although the 40-year average for 10-year AAA muni-to-UST relative value ratios is approximately 84%, the year-to-date average has been just 67%, within a range of 55% to 81%. Display 4 shows muni paths for 65%, 75% and 84%, but our base case is that 65% or lower will prevail by year-end. \u00d7 Display 4: The YTD average for the 10-year AAA muni-to-UST is 67% \uf065 Sources: Bloomberg, Morgan Stanley as of October 18, 2021.

Forecasts/estimates are based on current market conditions, subject to change, and may not necessarily come to pass. What to do? One of the most difficult decisions fixed income investors encounter is whether to purchase bonds when rates have risen and/or appear set to continue rising. That said, the scenario that has unfolded over the last two months presents just such a dilemma for prospective buyers. While our forecast chart may help to keep the potential yield rise and corresponding price decline in context, it may also be helpful to bear in mind some of the basic tenets of highquality muni investing, which include the preservation of principal and the maximization of tax-free income. With this in mind, purchasing tax exempts during what appear to be opportune, yet uncomfortable, times can (or may not) lead to a favorable \u201cfuture hindsight\u201d experience, along with the related media coverage, at some undetermined point in the future. In the interim, bondholders can enjoy \u201cclipping their coupons\u201d along the way while they wait. Stay tuned! CORPORATES: Despite a mid-summer move lower in bond yields, credit spreads and interest rates ended the third quarter close to where they started. Corporate credit markets have remained calm, with spreads near their tightest levels of the year, despite the recent increase in interest rate volatility. \u00d7 Display 5: The IG Corporate Option-Adjusted Spread \uf065 Source: Bloomberg, as of October 31, 2021, based on ICE BofA US Corporate Index option-adjusted spread.

See Disclosure section for index definitions. We continue to favor credit risk over interest rate risk, which has worked well for investors this year. Year to date, credit-sensitive assets such as high yield (4.53%), bank loans (4.65%) and preferreds (2.21%) have outperformed the broad Investment Grade (IG) indices such as the Bloomberg Aggregate, which was down 1.55% through quarter end.2 We believe the corporate bond market benefits from four key pillars of support: monetary policy, fiscal policy, improving fundamentals and strong technicals. The strong technicals have been apparent through the consistent weekly fund inflows into credit funds and ETFs. This trend continued in the third quarter as investors continued to look toward the corporate credit markets for yield in a low-yield environment. The IG market saw a marked increase in supply in September and October to $145 billion and $115 billion, respectively, which was digested with minimal friction. As yields have started migrating higher, anecdotal evidence points to increased pension fund and foreign buying of corporate credit, especially in the long end of the yield curve. The fundamental case for credit continues as corporations report strong earnings and de-lever their balance sheets. Corporate defaults and credit rating downgrades remain low. We did witness some credit deterioration in the Chinese property space recently, but we believe that U.S. financial exposure to this sector is rather limited. The biggest risk we see with credit markets is that valuations are expensive on a historical basis and we could see some volatility as fiscal and monetary support begin to fade. We think that fundamentals and technicals in the IG market will stay supportive in the near term and we would suggest investors remain overweight credit and default risk and underweight duration in their fixed income allocations. Given valuations in the credit market, we believe it\u2019s very important to be selective and to look at credits from a bottom-up perspective. As we head into earnings season, we will be watching for signs of margin compression as some companies face supply chain bottlenecks, wage inflation and other input costs that cannot be passed on. We have also seen some companies report margin issues as commodity and labor input costs remain elevated. We are overweight financials in our corporate portfolios as we believe this sector is largely immune from some of the supply chain and input cost issues that are affecting companies in sectors such as chemicals, industrials and consumer products. For the most part, multi-national investment grade companies have been able to manage the supply disruptions. Financials corporate bond spreads have lagged the tightening in other sectors. We believe supply-related technical pressure has caused financial spreads to lag and some of this supply should start to ease up in the 4th quarter. From a fundamental standpoint, bank and finance company earnings have been strong while balance sheet capitalization and credit quality remain solid. From an interest rate standpoint, the potential for a more hawkish Fed policy led us to be cautious on duration throughout the summer. However, front end yields have recently started to rise. Inflation pressures in the U.S. and abroad have pulled forward market expectations of interest rate hikes as central banks begin to remove the extraordinary liquidity programs implemented at the onset of the Covid crisis.

See Disclosure section for index definitions. PREFERREDS: During the third quarter, the ICE BofAML Fixed Rate Preferred index returned 22bps as interest rates were close to unchanged and credit spreads widened marginally at the end of September. The 2.21% return through the end of the 3rd quarter exceeds that of investment grade bond indices, with ICE BofAML U.S. Corporate Index down 1.12% and the Bloomberg Aggregate down 1.55%. Despite the continued performance, the asset class appears attractive relative to others in credit, especially on an after-tax basis. October featured the start of corporate earnings season and a wave of preferred new issues from financial institutions. YTD supply is tracking over 20% higher than 2020, and approximately double that of 2019. Refinancing high coupon securities remains the dominant theme, but issuers are also building capital in response to asset growth and regulatory changes, and still others are choosing to refinance LIBOR-based securities. Aside from some weakness in July and October, the market has absorbed the new supply well. Fund flows remain a steady source of support. Preferred ETFs averaged $200 million in weekly inflows during the summer, and despite a week of outflows to begin October, continued to benefit from weekly inflows through the end of the month.3 The largest ETF in the space now commands a market cap of $20 billion.4 Beyond serving as a catalyst for new supply, corporate earnings underscored the fundamental strength from some of October\u2019s issuers. Supply can be motivated by any number of factors from refinancing, to changing capital requirements, to acquisition financing, or simply organic growth. In the case of a regional that priced two deals in the month, loan growth topped 19% compared with an industry average of 1%. For a capital markets focused money center, their new issue was after 20% YTD growth in risk-weighted assets. These institutions are growing their balance sheets in response to attractive market conditions, and despite the supply headwinds, investors are getting compensated to finance that growth. In more detail on 3rd quarter results, property and casualty insurers had higher catastrophe losses, led by Hurricane Ida. Auto underwriting was an underperformer, in a reversal from Covid trends, as drivers returned to roadways and the inflated costs of labor and parts decreased profitability. Fundamentals appear stronger outside of auto where commercial lines are enjoying a strong pricing environment. Life insurers continue to experience elevated mortality rates, though positive results from investment portfolios provided some offset. For the banks, management teams began to make good on their forecasts for loan growth. Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans continue to run off, weighing on loan balances for some regional banks, but excluding this impact, the largest banks delivered loan growth in the quarter of 1%. Credit cards may have turned the corner as well. A weak spot for loan growth during Covid, card balances grew across the industry over 3% in the quarter, while charge-offs remained at or near historic lows. Investment banking had another banner quarter driven by heavy deal volume and an active underwriting environment. M&amp;A advisory had a record quarter for some banks while equity sales and trading remained robust as FICC revenues moderated towards historical trends. Capital levels declined across the group as institutions returned capital to shareholders through buybacks and balance sheets grew. Excess deposits remain elevated for banks, and if rates continue to rise, banks could improve net interest income by deploying the excess into securities. Despite hopeful commentary from management teams regarding revisions to the Supplementary Leverage Ratio, we are not anticipating regulatory changes in the near term. In portfolios, we continue to favor more credit sensitive areas of the market, as well as bonds with stronger structures, meaning less sensitivity to extension risk. With new issue coupons dipping below 4% in some cases, lower coupon securities can exhibit greater interest rate sensitivity as the yield curve steepens. We have a bias to own fixed-to-floating rate and shorter call, high coupon securities, known as \u201ccushion paper,\u201d to help mitigate this risk. \u00d7 Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interestrate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Municipal securities are subject to early redemption risk and sensitive to tax, legislative and political changes. Taxability Risk. Changes in tax laws or adverse determinations by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) may make the income from some municipal obligations taxable. By investing in investment company securities, the portfolio is subject to the underlying risks of that investment company\u2019s portfolio securities. In addition to the Portfolio\u2019s fees and expenses, the Portfolio generally would bear its share of the investment company\u2019s fees and expenses. Preferred securities are subject to interest rate risk and generally decreases in value if interest rates rise and increase in value if interest rates fall. High yield securities (\u201cjunk bonds\u201d) are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. \u00d7 1. Bloomberg, as of October 31, 2021 2.

{"content": "In early September, Evergrande erupted onto the front pages of newspapers and news sites causing a mini-panic in global risk assets. Within six weeks, investors went from wondering if Evergrande would become China\u2019s Lehman Brothers to assuming the Chinese government would \u201ctake care of it\u201d (i.e. manage the bankruptcy to prevent contagion). This assumption is perfectly plausible since this is how China has handled most previous bankruptcies of large corporates (e.g. HNA), local governments (e.g. debt-swap program in 2014 and debt-loan swap program in 2019) or financial institutions (e.g. Huarong Asset Management in 2021, Baoshang, Jinzhou, and Hengfeng in 2019). In addition, most directly related assets have already seen enormous corrections: Evergrande stock is down -90% and the broader MSCI China Real Estate Index has dropped more than -50% since early 2018 (while global equities have been up +30% since then). Chinese banks have only had a modest -16% correction this year but have been underperforming for years (down -70% relative to global equities since 2009). However, we suspect the consensus may be overoptimistic about Evergrande as its impact is likely to metastasize throughout the property market and the financial system. In addition, the consensus may not be taking into account how much the Chinese government\u2019s objectives have been realigned in the last few years to match Xi Jinping\u2019s new priorities, making an imminent easing and stimulus much less likely. Ultimately, as the problems become significant enough, policy will shift course and the traditional playbook will be implemented: liquidity surge; broad credit, fiscal, and even eventual property easing; bailouts; and rate cuts.

{"content": "By painting climate change with a broad brush, institutional investors are overlooking opportunities to potentially generate compelling market returns and make a meaningful impact on the most pressing issue facing our planet today. \u00d7 Investors have come to terms with the reality that climate change is no longer a theoretical threat. The effects of extreme weather, rising sea levels, resource scarcity and pollution are rippling across every continent with dire consequences for individuals, governments and businesses. Yet, for many investors, climate investing is still an abstract concept that is often lumped in with discussions of risk management, consumer preferences, the conflation of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) with impact investing. In fact, the implications of climate change are nuanced\u2014and so are the potential solutions. By looking at the issue of climate change through a broader lens, we believe investors can be better positioned to identify opportunities that meaningfully address a range of climate issues and potentially deliver compelling risk-adjusted returns. Here are six of the most common myths percolating around climate investing. \u00d7 Myth #1 The climate problem is all about global warming. REALITY: Problems are manifold. For many people, the term \u201cglobal warming\u201d evokes images of melting icebergs in the Arctic Circle. This is indeed a major and daunting consequence of climate change. Still, there are many aspects of the climate issue that are more tangible and potentially more manageable. They include, but are not limited to: POLLUTION: From visible air quality issues in smog-choked Beijing and Delhi to leafy London where nitrogen oxide levels routinely exceed safe norms\u2014 pollution is present in our daily lives. RESOURCE SCARCITY: Drought is a growing problem that affects communities and farmers around the world. Last year, Cape Town nearly ran out of water and introduced the concept of Day Zero which effectively triggers the start of drastic water rationing. California also is dealing with the acute effects of drought and, now, flooding. Lakes in many parts of Africa are shrinking, thus leading to social strife, conflict, migration and refugee crises. WASTE MANAGEMENT: Many of our cities are running out of landfill and other solutions to dispose waste. Plastics are making their way into the oceans, marine life and our food chain at alarming levels. At the current pace there could be more plastic than fish in the oceans by 2050.1 ECO-DIVERSITY: Sections of pristine rainforest in Indonesia are routinely razed for agriculture and timber. This is also true in Brazil where the Amazonian rain forests produce 20% of our planet\u2019s oxygen. In 2016 alone, 30% of the coral in the Great Barrier Reef was destroyed.2 \u00d7 Myth #2 An ESG strategy addresses climate solutions. REALITY: ESG is necessary, but not a sufficient condition, for addressing climate change. ESG, or the incorporation of environmental, social and governance risk factors, is an increasingly core part of any investment strategy. It seeks to limit the operational, financial or reputational risk that could arise from something going wrong in one of these dimensions. We believe that creating positive climate impact, however, requires more than ESG hygiene. It requires actively investing in businesses, typically putting primary capital to work in a private equity context, whose core activities create new positive effects on the environment, be it a reduction in CO2 emission, pollution or resource consumption. \u00d7 Myth #3 Renewable energy is the main solution. REALITY: The investable opportunity set goes far beyond power generation. Renewables have historically been a cornerstone of climate change investing\u2014but there is a world of opportunity besides windmills and solar panels. A comprehensive climate strategy will look beyond power generation to energy efficiency, housing, transportation, food and recycling. Here again, some of the most distinctive investment ideas, both from the perspective of returns and impact, focus on solving specific problems, improving existing technology or making broader adoption more feasible. Minimizing the carbon impact of transportation, for instance, isn\u2019t just about funding electric cars and makers of lithium-ion batteries. There are myriad companies in this space that are contributing to more eco-friendly transportation in seemingly small but immensely impactful ways. One example is a battery-exchange kiosk company in Asia, which makes electric two-wheelers a more viable alternative with a creative answer to charging. Rather than plugging in their vehicles and waiting for them to charge, drivers use the kiosks to swap batteries. The kiosks are technology-agnostic; as new batteries come onto the market, the company simply adds them to its catalog. Similarly, green chemistry is a category that doesn\u2019t get the same attention as alternative energy but offers ample room for reducing the use of fossil fuel derivatives in items of everyday consumption, from packaging materials to paints and furniture polish. The same is true of new business models around recycling, compostable packaging materials, waste-to-energy generation and waste water processing. There is also a plethora of investment ideas related to food. Demand for meat protein is growing along with the world\u2019s population and income levels. Yet, livestock is a major source of emission of the greenhouse gas methane\u2014which is approximately 30 times worse than CO2.3 As such, sustainable seafood, which has a much smaller carbon footprint, presents a blue ocean of opportunity. \u00d7 Myth #4 Renewables need subsidies to offer compelling returns. REALITY: Cost has declined massively since the advent of renewables and pricing is now competitive with traditional energy in many markets. It was once the case that renewables thrived and died on subsidies, but three major changes make this idea an antiquated one. First, costs have come down substantially while technology has improved; it is now feasible to deploy renewable energy in very small spaces or across remote geographies. Blades on windmills now approach aeroplane wings in terms of size and sophistication, while solar panel prices have declined by more than 60% in the last decade.4 As this technology reaches critical mass, installation and servicing are also becoming more cost effective and convenient. Secondly, investors can now target specific projects thus making sure the solution aligns with the problem. Markets are not monoliths, and energy prices, along with solar and wind resources, vary within regions. This makes renewables very competitive in some places and less so in others. It also puts the onus on investors to look at the specific context in which renewable projects operate. Finally, demand for distributed solutions is on the rise, driven by ageing grid infrastructure in developed markets and, in the case of many emerging markets, because of the absence of grids. A company that focuses on making and selling solar-powered home systems in Southern Africa, for example, is opening doors for environmental and social change. In switching out kerosene or diesel for solar power, consumers are saving money, helping improve air quality in their communities and tapping into a more reliable and sustainable source of power. \u00d7 Myth #5 Early stage clean-tech investing is a wild goose chase. REALITY: Savvy investors target low-key solutions rather than moon shots. Clean-tech investing has been through a few bubble-bust cycles and, like other areas in early-stage investing, there have been some high-profile successes and failures. While a lot of early attention in clean tech investing has been on grand, over-arching solutions, there is a growing and rich universe of companies working behind the scenes to tackle specific causes or effects of climate change. Indeed, the sector has evolved, as have investors. Instead of looking for a silver bullet for desalination at scale, savvy investors are looking at software that regulates water systems pumps. Rather than banking on the next big thing in electric cars or batteries, smart early-stage investors are backing things like hardware to facilitate data collection and power optimization at charging stations. These ideas may not make headlines\u2014 and that is often a good thing\u2014but they are collectively creating the fabric for meaningful and incremental gains in their respective areas. \u00d7 Myth #6 Climate investing is highly dependent on political and regulatory changes. REALITY: Individuals, businesses and local governments can wield as much power. Media reports focus a lot of government level pronouncements on climate policy, however the underlying trend of climate investing is a steadfast one that, increasingly, transcends politics. Collectively, individuals, corporations and local governments can wield more power. Consider the United States. While the federal government has taken a different direction on climate initiatives, individual states and cities are rolling out ambitious plans of their own. In March, New Mexico joined California, Hawaii and the District of Columbia in setting a goal for all renewable and carbon-free electricity by 2045, and governors for a dozen other U.S. states are reportedly planning to unveil similar goals. Meanwhile, some of the world\u2019s largest companies are taking meaningful steps to reduce their environmental footprints. Not to be underestimated, individuals are taking a stand, as citizens and as consumers. This is all to say that a comprehensive climate strategy encompasses ideas big and small. It looks to address the broader threat of global warming, as well as to support grassroots initiatives to seek to solve problems related to pollution, resource scarcity, waste management and eco-diversity. Innovation does involve technology and business risk. However, a globally-diversified, active approach across asset classes\u2014from early-stage to infrastructure to agriculture\u2014can offer investors a means by which to achieve meaningful returns and make a real impact in addressing the most pressing issue facing our planet today. \u00d7 Vikram Raju Head of Climate Investing | Private Markets AIP Private Markets Team a.banner-btn { -webkit-border-radius: 25px; -moz-border-radius: 25px;border-radius: 25px; text-decoration: none; border: 2px solid #fff; padding: 10px 20px; font-size: 1.4rem; background-color: #ffffff; color: #337ab7;margin-top: 0px;display: inline-table;font-family: karlabold; } 2tileBento2 INSIGHTS SustainableSignals Survey 7 key findings emerged when we asked asset owners about their views on sustainable investing.

{"content": "The market remains at a high multiple. Despite September\u2019s mild pull-back, the MSCI World Index is still trading on 18.7x the next 12 months\u2019 earnings \u2013 a 26% premium to the average multiple of the last 20 years.1 It is notable how resilient this multiple has been as earnings have recovered from the June 2020 trough, down only 8% over the last 15 months, while the market\u2019s forward earnings have gained 48%.2 This has left the market at a multiple that was never seen between 2002 and 2020. There are those who justify this premium on earnings given the low risk-free rates and the absence of reasonable alternatives to equities, but when you look at the current premium on sales it is far more stark: the MSCI World is trading on 2.2x the next 12 months\u2019 sales \u2013 a massive 66% above the 20-year average.3 This extreme valuation versus sales is on the back of sharp improvements in profitability and brings risks for the market. Any fall in profitability will not just hit earnings, but could potentially hurt multiples as well, leading to a double-whammy effect on markets. \u00d7 \u201cThe MSCI World is trading on 2.2x the next 12 months\u2019 sales \u2013 66% above the 20-year average\u201d Company earnings have been helped by the fall in both corporate taxation levels and interest rates. The corporate tax rate has fallen dramatically in many countries and is down five percentage points or more over the last decade in France, Italy, Japan and Spain, as well as in the U.S. and U.K.4 This tailwind is very unlikely to be repeated, and may well turn into a headwind, with the U.K. having announced a six percentage point rise to 25% from 2023, the U.S. discussing a rise in the headline corporate tax rate and, more broadly, multiple countries pushing for a global minimum tax rate. Interest costs must also be a risk from here, given that rates have been at their lowest levels for over 5,000 years.5 It is of course possible that investment grade companies will continue to be able to leverage up on virtually free money and \u201cjunk\u201d credits (high yield is clearly a misnomer) to borrow at below 3% in Europe and around 4.5% in the U.S.,6 but any kind of interest rate normalisation will hit profitability. Even without the profit superchargers of low taxation and interest rates, underlying profitability is high, as can be seen by looking at the EBIT margin (earnings before interest and taxes). The predicted 12 months\u2019 forward EBIT margin levels are over 16%, well above the 20-year average of 13%, and even above 2006\u2019s pre-Global Financial Crisis bubble peak of 14%.7 To be fair, there are reasons for optimism that margins could stay at these peak levels or even go higher. If there is a sustained reflationary recovery, the resulting healthy sales growth could drive further operational leverage. In addition, earnings estimates tend to be lagging indicators (on the way up as well as the way down), meaning that there may be further earnings upgrades to come, on top of the 48% gains since June 2020.8 \u201cPredicted 12 months\u2019 forward EBIT margin levels are well above the 20-year average, and even above the pre-GFC peak\u201d Against this positive view is the potential for significant cost pressures over the next decade. The current COVID-related disruptions should fade, but real structural issues could emerge: The experience of the pandemic has meant that corporates are keen to build robustness into their supply chains, rather than purely focussing on efficiency. The likely outcome is higher levels of inventory and short supply chains, with resulting cost increases. This shift fits with governments\u2019 desire for \u2018onshoring. The last few decades have seen the triumph of capital over labour. The emergence of emerging market workforces into the global labour pool and explicit pro-capital policies in developed markets have increased profit\u2019s share of gross domestic product at the expense of labour\u2019s share and boosted inequality in developed markets. There are signs that the pendulum is starting to swing back. Companies are likely to be expected to pay for or remedy the negative externalities that result from their activities. Carbon is the most obvious example, with momentum behind carbon markets and taxes, but it is likely to spread further. Plastic, sugar and water are physical goods where more of society\u2019s costs will be forced on to producers. This could also apply to the societal and mental health costs that the social media giants currently shrug off. Pricing power is key to passing these likely costs on to protect margins. Here too there is a tougher environment, given governments\u2019 and regulators\u2019 less friendly attitude to corporates around anti-trust and competition. At the moment there is plenty of pricing power in a world of COVID-related shortages. This is particularly stark writing from the U.K., where many would be willing to pay whatever it takes for the privilege of filling the car up with petrol. A more global phenomenon is children urging their parents to pay whatever it takes to get their hands on a precious Xbox or PS5 \u2026 They\u2019re in such short supply, children do not even mind which console they get! As the world moves to a steady state of normalised supply but rising input prices as the crisis recedes, we will find out who actually has pricing power. The recent experience of iron ore shows the vulnerability of commodity prices once shortages ease. \u201cAt the moment, there is plenty of pricing power in a world of COVID-related shortages\u201d Owning high quality has not been a comfortable ride over the last year. The surprising pace of economic recovery from COVID-19, driven by massive government interventions and the vaccine miracle, has boosted the earnings of lower quality companies, which have therefore outperformed. Optimists see a period of strong economic growth \u2013 helped by government fiscal largesse \u2013 which will allow the earnings party to continue. Our fear is that even if the macro environment is favourable, which is far from a given, the resulting cost pressures will make it tough for the market to hold on to the forecast peak margins in the absence of the precious pricing power which is core to our stock selection, and which has been one of the key drivers of our portfolios\u2019 compounding over the last quarter century. \u00d7 1 .

Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy\u2019s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 Bruno Paulson Managing Director International Equity Team Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I Previous Next Static File Component", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/no-margin-for-error.html"}

{"content": "Meet 146 Investment Firms That Founders Will Love Now including venture capital firms, this year's list of founder-friendly investors is the biggest one yet. Reproduced with permission of: BY GRAHAM WINFREY, FEATURES EDITOR, INC. \u00d7 FROM THE OCTOBER 2021 ISSUE OF INC. MAGAZINE FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS, Inc.'s Founder-Friendly Private Equity Firms list has shined a light on the PE outfits that support founder-led companies through both good times and, well, global pandemics. This year, we had an epiphany while compiling the list: Private equity firms don't have a monopoly on being founder-friendly. Venture capitalists are people too. 155% Growth of U.S. private equity and related investment from the first half of 2020 ($89.2 billion) through the first six months of 2021 ($227.2 billion). 144% Growth of U.S. private equity-backed exits from the first half of 2020 ($51.2 billion) through the first six months of 2021 ($125.1 billion). 49% Growth of U.S. private equity and related fundraising from the first half of 2020 ($146.7 billion) through the first six months of 2021 ($218.3 billion). 61% Growth of U.S. private equity and related deals from the first half of 2020 (1,598) through the first six months of 2021 (2,575). 121% Growth of U.S. venture capital investment from the first half of 2020 ($57.9 billion) through the first six months of 2021 (a record $128.2 billion). 425% Growth of U.S. venture capital-backed exits from the first half of 2020 ($24.9 billion) through the first six months of 2021 ($130.8 billion). 63% Growth of U.S. venture capital fundraising from the first half of 2020 ($40.5 billion) through the first six months of 2021 (a record $66 billion). The good news: Whether your company is seeking venture capital or private equity, there's no shortage of dollars to chase. During the first half of 2021, U.S. venture capital fundraising reached $66 billion in commitments, setting a record for capital raised during the first two quarters of a year, according to financial data firm Refinitiv. Private equity fundraising grew to $218 billion in commitments, the highest figure in a decade. Surprisingly, there's perhaps never been a better time for business owners in need of investment capital. Of course, the only money that comes without strings is money you find in the couch. Accept private equity, and the conversation inevitably turns to whether you should remain as CEO post-investment. \"It could be that making your company grow from $0 to $10 million is something that only you could have done, but helping your company grow from $10 million to $100 million is not something you have the skills to do, and you need help,\" says David Snow, co-founder of Privcap Media, a creative agency for private equity firms and No. 4,571 on the 2021 Inc. 5000 list. \"That should be a candid conversation that takes place at the outset of negotiations.\" A candid conversation, that is, between your investors, your company--and you. Methodology Inc.'s Founder-Friendly Investor list comprises firms identified by our editors or submitted to us through an application process. To confirm those firms' commitment to investing in entrepreneur-led companies, we gather data on how their portfolio companies have grown and extensively interview entrepreneurs, including those who've exited, on their experiences with the firms. On that basis, we produce a proprietary score that determines the private equity, growth equity, and venture capital firms whose missions most significantly support startups and the men and women who found them. \u00d7 RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and that the value of Portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Stocks of small- and medium-capitalization companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Privately placed and restricted securities may be subject to resale restrictions as well as a lack of publicly available information, which will increase their illiquidity and could adversely affect the ability to value and sell them (liquidity risk). \u00d7 Morgan Stanley Capital Partners Morgan Stanley Capital Partners manages a middle-market private equity platform.

{"content": "Markets became jittery over September, with the realisation that summer has come to an end and winter is coming. The S&amp;P 500 and MSCI Europe Index experienced their first monthly fall since January 2021, moving down -4.7% (USD) and -2.9% (EUR) respectively1. In contrast to the other developed markets, the MSCI Japan Index was up over the month at 4.5% (JPY)1. The best performing sector was energy, with the MSCI ACWI Energy Index up 9.1% (USD)1 on the back of rising energy prices, whilst most other sectors moved down. Energy prices could in part be to blame for the move up in yields, as the closely watched US 10-Year yield moved up to 1.5 from 1.3 at the end of August2. In turn, the VIX moved up to 232 by month end, the highest since May\u2019s market jitters. \u00d7 A focus on Japan and China The surge in Japanese equities, which began the last week of August, continued in September as Prime Minister Suga resigned due to the handling of the pandemic. By month end, Fumio Kishida had been voted in by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, as the new Japanese Prime Minister, indicating that there is likely to be more of the same. Therefore, this could be interpreted as not necessarily a negative or a positive catalyst. The exuberance seen earlier in the month appears to have been short-lived as a debt crisis involving one of China\u2019s largest property developers began dominating headlines, leaving Japanese equities to languish the second half of the month. Indeed, the giant Chinese property developer rocked markets across the globe, especially in Asia. The MSCI China Index (HKD), was down -5.0%1 over September, as it continued to be one of the worst performing countries year-to-date. Growth slowing, but likely to remain healthy As we had been expecting, there has been a material slowdown in the rate of change of growth. However, this is from a high level to normal, but still healthy growth. Whilst inflation has been a concern for some time in the wake of global reopenings, the August US headline CPI rose 5.3% YoY, and 0.3% over the month,3 which is less than expected. That said, rising energy prices are not likely to feed into inflation immediately and supply shortages are also not going away, raising the question of whether inflation is in fact transitory. Valuations and positioning suggest caution with many market indicators continuing to show stretched levels. The S&amp;P 500 12-month forward PE is currently 20.7, compared with the median of 15.0.4 Moreover, we expect that the move up in rates is not positive for US equities, which tend to be high duration. Indeed, this has impacted rate sensitive sectors, whereas energy stocks in contrast have done well. We are keeping an eye on key events on the horizon, including the looming US debt ceiling and the upcoming US earnings season. Investment implications We have reduced risk over the month in two stages, as we believe there is likely to be limited upside to equities for the remainder of the year. Given high valuations and fragile, risk-off sentiment, we are concerned that there could be a market correction and elevated volatility. At the same time, we are seeking opportunities to take advantage of any excessive weakness. Chinese Internet Equities We have implemented a modest initial overweight to Chinese Internet Equities. Whilst China has been hard hit this year, there are some potential pockets of opportunity. Regulatory headwinds to China Internet seem to be stabilising, with fundamentals of key companies remaining strong. Since the February 2021 peak, there has been a more than 50% decline in China Internet,5 making valuations fairly attractive. While volatility is likely to remain high in the near-term, the disconnect between fundamentals and valuations makes the risk rewards of the trade skew slightly to the upside.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser\u2019s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio\u2019s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio\u2019s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. \u00d7 Andrew Harmstone Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Manfred Hui Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Select Product(s) Right Click Edit", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/winter-is-coming.html"}
{"content": "Having enjoyed a decade of equity and bond prices generally rising together, investors have more recently had to deal with the less pleasant situation of both bonds and shares going down together. The reason for this is the growing concern that central banks, for a long time perceived as a backstop to financial markets, may have to start tightening policy, even as the economy weakens, because inflation risks are rising and need to be brought under control. Stagflation, a bad environment for most assets, is increasingly discussed as a possibility. \u00d7 While there might be some truth to this narrative, it is not entirely true, or at the very least glosses over a lot of nuances. Yes, the acceleration in economic growth is slowing; yes, central banks are clearly planning to reduce monetary accommodation; and yes, higher inflation may lead them to tighten policy quicker and further than they might otherwise would. However, the global economy is still expected to post above-average growth this year and next, so stagflation (depending on how you define it) seems unlikely. Central banks are moving to tighten policy (the Norges Bank and Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) have already raised rates), but this is more a removal of extraordinary monetary accommodation, implemented due to the COVID crisis, rather than a desire to make policy restrictive. And central banks have been at pains to emphasize that they see the current surge in inflation as largely transitory rather than something they are responding to. So, while central bankers might be sounding less dovish than they did before (unsurprising given the quicker than expected economic recovery), it generally doesn\u2019t sound fair to describe them as hawks either. However, there is a risk that monetary policy normalization may happen quicker than in the past. In the 2010s, central bankers with faster growing economies (e.g., the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England) were held back from raising rates as much as they might by other central banks which were not tightening (e.g., the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of Japan). This was due to the FX markets: central banks which raised interest rates saw their currencies appreciate, which tightened monetary conditions and reduced the need for further rate hikes. Some analysts named this the \u201ccentral bank peloton\u201d because, as in cycling, individuals found it very difficult to break away from the pack. This time around, though, with economies recovering in a synchronized fashion following COVID lockdowns, the entire peloton is turning less dovish at the same time, meaning central banks wanting to tighten will be less constrained by their peers. It also suggests that currency markets may be more difficult to read, as interest rate and growth differentials are less pronounced. On balance, we expect central banks to proceed slowly and with caution, but this could still lead to volatility in markets, depending on what investors expect. Even though markets have priced the beginning of rate hiking cycles, they are expecting slow and low cycles, stopping well below previous highs in policy rates. If investors change their mind on this, for example because higher inflation appears to become more entrenched and the economy remains resilient, bond yields might need to rise considerably. In credit markets, spreads are still below long-term averages; this seems justified given the benign economic outlook, and stronger corporate and household balance sheets, but even a minor deterioration in credit conditions could impact valuations, and there are concerns about how markets will cope once central bank support programs end. In short, we believe the risks stem more from investors assuming very benign conditions will persist rather than central banks being very aggressive. Of course, the \u201ccentral bank put\u201d could still come into play, with tightening measures delayed or cancelled if markets wobble too much, but the pace of normalization will primarily depend on the state of the economy. In terms of our market views, we have generally been reducing portfolio risk given the uncertain outlook. We remain long risky assets (corporate credit, securitized credit, emerging markets) because of the positive economic outlook and strong fundamentals, and in spite of credit spreads being tight relative to history. We expect government bond yields to drift higher as we move towards tighter monetary policy. \u00d7 Display 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date \uf065 Note: USD-based performance. Source: Bloomberg.

Fixed Income Outlook September turned out to be a far less benign month for financial markets than August, with both government bond yields rising and equities selling off. The price action has continued so far in October, with notable weakness in corporate credit and emerging markets. As is typical, given the price action, the U.S. dollar has appreciated on a trade-weighted basis. The reason for this weakness in financial markets is easy to identify: economic growth surprises have turned negative while inflation continues to surprise to the upside. This spells a potentially unfriendly scenario for markets: central banks tightening monetary policy just as the economy starts to slow. Indeed, in addition to several emerging market central banks tightening policy, the Norges Bank and RBNZ have both recently implemented their first rate hikes since the COVID epidemic struck. While none of these banks are big enough to significantly affect global liquidity conditions, their behavior is indicative of the direction in which the larger central banks are moving, given central banks tend to move together. Some of the more gloomy analysts are already talking about a stagflation. We think some of these concerns are overstated. In particular, stagflation (an environment of high inflation and low growth or recession), still seems unlikely as the economic data still point to exceptionally strong global growth in 2021 continuing into 2022. Yes, economic data are no longer (on average) surprising to the upside, and economies are not accelerating further. However, timely indicators of growth, such as business survey indices, remain consistent with above average growth rates, so there is little evidence of a slowdown, and it was always going to be difficult for growth to keep on accelerating as it came out of lockdown. One point of concern is the state of the Chinese economy and the risk of defaults in its real estate sector, but so far it would appear the authorities are maintaining their typical tight control of the situation. However, inflationary pressures are growing stronger. The most recent surge has come from higher energy prices (especially European natural gas prices), but the pressure is more broad-based: many other commodities (e.g., food, a particular concern for EM central banks) are also at multi-year highs; COVID-induced bottlenecks continue to cause shortages in many consumer goods supply chains, and there are widespread reports of labor shortages across developed economies. It is currently unclear just how persistent, or permanent, many of these issues are, but what is certain is that the current surge in inflation is expected to last longer than previously thought, with economists now forecasting it will only return to more normal levels towards the end of 2022. So far developed economy central banks have remained adamant that the inflation surge is transitory and is not something to respond to, although some (such as the ECB) have said they will remain vigilant to it causing \u201csecond round effects\u201d and a more persistent increase. Medium term inflation expectations have risen, but are still only returning to levels which suggest investors and households think central banks will achieve their inflation mandates. So, there is little need for them to go into inflation-fighting mode just yet, but the inflation data clearly introduces a hawkish risk to policy. Emerging market central banks are already tightening, given the risk inflation poses to their economies through the currency markets, but they now face the risk of choking a still nascent, weak recovery. Bond investors are clearly rethinking just how accommodative central banks will be. One factor to consider is that, while no developed market central bank has sounded extremely hawkish, they are all clearly moving in the same direction. This is important because, to use the cycling analogy, monetary policy in recent years has been like a peloton of cyclists from which it is very difficult for an individual bank to break free and set tighter monetary policy (because this would lead to a stronger currency and remove the need to tighten). However, if all are moving in a tightening direction, then it is easier for individual central banks to end their COVID crisis programs and start raising rates. Central banks are still communicating a slowly-slowly approach, which we think the markets have priced appropriately. However, the risk to bond valuations comes more from the length of the hiking cycle and the eventual terminal policy rate. At present investors seem to think the tightening cycles will be short, lasting only a few years and not taking policy rates back to historical levels. But if they start expecting a more normal central bank cycle, then yields could rise further. Credit investors have also become more nervous recently, causing credit spreads to widen; we think this is mainly reflective of how tight spreads had become rather than any meaningful increase in default risk. Where does this leave our views on markets? In general, we remain overweight the riskier, cyclical sectors but we have been reducing portfolio risk. On government bonds, we expect yields to drift higher and have been reducing duration exposure. We have also reduced our underweight to U.S. dollar with not a strong conviction on direction in the short to medium term. We remain overweight corporate credit and securitized credit. We are overweight emerging markets, for idiosyncratic reasons rather than a general preference for the asset class. Developed Market (DM) Rate/Foreign Currency (FX) Monthly Review In September, we saw bond yields rising globally along with risk assets selling off. On the back of weakness in risk sentiment, the U.S. dollar rose against both developed market and emerging market currencies over the month. While growth surprises have turned negative, inflation continues to surprise to the upside globally. Central banks started reducing excess accommodation instituted last year, by raising interest rates or signaling a shift towards less easy policy as economies normalize. Norges Bank became the first developed market central bank to hike policy rate this year. Outlook During the final quarter of 2021, policy is still expected to be a dominant driver of asset performance, but the recovery in the economy to date means that policymakers are eyeing how they will dial back emergency support measures without threatening the economic recovery. We expect global central banks to continue removing excess accommodation as growth and inflation outlook improves over the coming months. While we do not expect a dramatic sell-off in government bond markets, we think the risk is skewed to yields rising, as markets price in the path to monetary policy normalization. We expect inflation to remain high for some time, with year-over-year rates only declining in 2H22. It is still our view that the surge is mainly transitory, due to technical factors, higher commodity prices, and temporary bottlenecks in the economy. In terms of currencies, we expect U.S. dollar to remain range bound against developed market and emerging market currencies and don\u2019t have a strong conviction on direction in the short to medium term. We have been reducing the U.S. dollar underweight against developed market and emerging market currencies. Emerging Market (EM) Rate/FX Monthly Review EM debt returns were negative in September. Hard currency sovereigns, as represented by the JPM EMBI Global Diversified Index, delivered negative returns, driven by wider spreads and yields. EM Corporate returns were also negative for the month with high yield underperforming investment grade corporates (proxied by the JPM CEMBI Broad Diversified Index. Local currency bonds, represented by the JPM GBI-EM Global Diversified Index posted negative returns, primarily due to weaker EM currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Outlook The outlook for EM debt in the weeks ahead looks challenging, as the asset class faces multiple disruptive forces. The prospects of Fed tapering as early as November and its impact on real yields and the USD may weigh on EM asset performance. We remain cautious on risk in the near term, despite valuations being generally attractive. We are biased towards EM High Yield credits with positive idiosyncratic stories and/or exposed to higher oil prices (and similarly, in EMFX). In rates, we prefer yield curves that are already pricing in aggressive monetary policy tightening. Credit Monthly Review Credit spreads over the month were broadly unchanged in Europe and tightened slightly in the U.S. Sector and corporate news in the month remained dominated by M&amp;A and higher costs driven by structural shortages in both labour and transportation. Global convertibles, as measured by the Refinitiv Global Convertibles Focus Index, held up in difficult markets in September, outperforming both equity and credit. Outlook Looking forward, we see credit as fully valued but likely to consolidate at current levels supported by the four pillars of: (1) expectations that financial conditions will remain easy supporting low default rates (2) economic activity that is expected to rebound as vaccinations allow economies to re-open (3) strong corporate profitability with conservative balance sheet management as overall uncertainty remains high (4) demand for credit to stay strong as excess liquidity looks to be invested. We expect good ability to earn attractive carry but see limited opportunities for capital gains from spread tightening. Securitized Products Monthly Review Market activity increased in September both in terms of new issuance and secondary trading. There was nearly $50 billion of new issue activity across Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS), Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS) and Asset Backed Securities (ABS) markets, highest volume of the year, but supply was comfortably absorbed. Agency MBS performed well in September, as bank buying increased with the steeper curve and Fed buying continued. U.S. non-agency RMBS spreads were essentially unchanged in September. U.S. ABS spreads were slightly tighter again in September while U.S. CMBS spreads were largely unchanged. European RMBS, CMBS and ABS activity also increased in September as much of Europe returned from holiday. European securitized spreads continued to tighten in September, despite talk of the ECB potentially reducing its asset purchases. Outlook We believe the securitized market offers a unique combination of low duration, attractive yields, and solid credit fundamentals. We expect securitized new issuance and secondary activity to remain robust in October. Rates volatility will likely remain elevated, but credit fundamentals should remain very solid, especially for residential and consumer assets. \u00d7 The views and opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Management team as of August 2021 and are subject to change based on market, economic and other conditions.

There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. \u00d7 Global Fixed Income Team Our fixed income investment capabilities are driven by eight specialized teams \u2013 Agency MBS, Emerging Markets, Floating-Rate Loans, High Yield, Investment Grade Credit, Municipals, Multi-Sector, and Securitized \u2013 which span the global fixed income capital markets.

{"content": "In 2021, Seema Hingorani, a managing director at Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM), received an unusual honor for a U.S. citizen -- the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur. The medal was granted in recognition of her work addressing the gender gap in the global asset management industry through Girls Who Invest, a non-profit she founded in the U.S. in 2015. While she was the chief investment officer of the New York City Retirement Systems, Hingorani was indeed amazed by the paucity of women she met among asset managers. Thus, she founded an organization aimed at educating a new generation of females to enter and renew the industry. Its long-term goal: for women to oversee 30% of industry AUM by 2030.1 Over a five-year period, more than 850 college students have attended the 10-week, subsidized summer program, physically or virtually. A proof of its success: 80% of alumnae have stayed in the investment business since graduating.2 Diversity is Essential There's little doubt the industry faces large-scale gender inequality. Just 9% of funds domiciled in the U.S. are managed by women. Efforts to improve the balance have so far only brought modest gains: The percentage of female fund managers globally increased from 10.3% in 2016 to 11% in 2020.3 While developing Girls Who Invest, Hingorani discovered several reasons explaining this gap. First, is the lack of a pipeline. Also, many young women know little about the investment management industry or had been turned off by unflattering stereotypes of the finance industry. However, multiple studies have shown that gender-diverse investment teams outperform others. Diverse viewpoints typically lead indeed to more innovative, balanced, and informed decisions. According to a study by consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co., companies in the top-quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 21% more likely to outperform on profitability and 27% more likely to have superior value creation. 4 MSIM\u2019s Ambition is to Lead the Way With gender diversity's positive impact on performance and more demand for change from clients, investment firms have started stepping up. Among the changes made: Introducing programs aimed at boosting the pipeline of women recruits, holding managers accountable for meeting diversity goals, and forming mentorship programs matching senior executives with more-junior female talent. In 2019, Hingorani joined MSIM, and soon after created a junior investment talent-development program aimed at the retention of diverse talent in the business. Hingorani is supporting the firm in this transition on a daily basis. One initiative involves supporting over 100 junior investment professionals from all parts of the world. The participants are assigned to small groups, each working with a sponsor. Team members come from mid and junior levels in the organization and work across all asset classes. \u201cWe're helping younger talent quickly build their investing expertise and professional relationships to position them better for long-term careers at MSIM and in the industry,\" she says. These advances are helping close the gender gap, a critical societal and corporate challenge. MSIM is proud to play an important role in this transformation and to lead the way. \u00d7 1 Targets may not be realized and cannot be guaranteed.

{"content": "Given the increasingly disruptive force of climate change-related weather events, the commitment of countries and companies across the globe to achieving net zero carbon emission by mid-century promises to be one of the themes driving investment markets over the coming decades. The push from policymakers poses risks to those in carbon-intensive sectors who lag, but may also open opportunities for enablers and innovators. \u00d7 Recognising the importance of both capturing related opportunities and mitigating the increasing risks, the Global Balanced Risk Control team has developed an approach that seeks to capitalise on these changes. Our science-based approach decarbonises our portfolios\u2019 core exposures according to the 1.5\u00b0C scenario, aligned with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommendations and targets net zero emissions for our equity exposure by 2050. We complement this approach by assessing companies\u2019 ESG and Low Carbon Transition scores. This is implemented whilst maintaining our core time-tested approach to asset allocation. In this piece, we look at how countries and some key sectors are responding to the challenge, and we also discuss potential solutions for investors. Taking the temperature: the current climate The recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC on the physical effects of climate change1 comes as governments update their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in an attempt to achieve the Paris Climate Accord goals to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C from pre-industrial levels, and preferably to 1.5\u00b0C by 2050. The IPCC\u2019s message is unambiguous; human activity, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels, is heating the planet and causing increased extreme weather events. The economic and social consequences of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have long been projected to be devastating. As early as 2006, the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change,2 estimated the ongoing cost of inaction on climate change to be equivalent to 5%-20% of global GDP p.a.3 The IPCC demands urgent action, as without sustained reductions in emissions over the coming decades we will likely exceed 2\u00b0C global warming before the end of the century. In fact, in almost all emissions scenarios, global warming is likely to hit 1.5C \u201cin the early 2030s\u201d. The commitments required to limit emissions will profoundly affect the highest-emitting business sectors. While we cannot be certain of the outcomes, we should analyse how the most highly exposed sectors are managing the risk and uncertainty. Country level policy responses \u2013 Greater ambition, but still not enough Key to achieving the Paris Climate Accord goals are the NDCs and mid-century goals. The increasing number of countries committing to net zero emissions by mid-century is a bright spot in climate policy. At COP26 in November 2021, governments are expected to update their NDCs for the first time since the Agreement was signed in 2015. As of August 2021, 107 countries have submitted new NDC targets. However, many do not match up to the ambition required to achieve the Paris goals. Furthermore, a number of countries have still not submitted any targets at all. \u00d7 Display 1: Global Commitments \uf065 Source: * commitments planned or announced Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit** UNFCCC \u00d7 Display 1: Global Commitments Source: * commitments planned or announced Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit** UNFCCC We now provide an update on the policies of some key countries in the climate transition: CHINA: QUEST FOR GLOBAL CLIMATE LEADERSHIP VERSUS THIRST FOR GROWTH China\u2019s remarkable economic growth means it now emits more than a quarter of global emissions, so its actions to reduce emissions over the next decade will be crucial to limiting global warming. China recently announced its aim to achieve net zero before 20604 and to increase non-fossil fuel-generated energy to 25% of total energy consumption by 2030. To help achieve this goal, China intends to double wind and solar capacity to 1,200 GW by 2030. While coal has shown a downward trend in China\u2019s energy mix, recent developments signal a misalignment between climate targets and policy. The 10% year-on-year increase in coal consumption, and the development of new coal powered plants in the first half of 2021 demonstrate a conflict between China\u2019s economic stability and climate goals. Uncertainty over China\u2019s path will remain until the country officially submits its NDC. Another key component of China\u2019s plan is the introduction of the world\u2019s largest national emissions trading scheme, in terms of emissions traded, which came into force in July 2021. Whilst the price is low compared with more mature schemes such as that of the EU ($60 in July versus China\u2019s opening price of approximately $7), it should facilitate companies migrating from existing regional schemes throughout China. While we do not believe the current price is high enough to discourage coal usage, this could change if we see any upward price pressure. China\u2019s scheme will initially cover 40% of national emissions5 (15% of global emissions), but this is expected to expand over time. US: CLIMATE U-TURN TO BUILD BACK GREENER President Biden has made tackling climate change a cornerstone of his policy agenda. On 20 January 2021, he reinforced this commitment by re-joining the Paris Agreement and soon after pledged to reduce net US emissions by at least half by 2030 (50%-52% lower than 2005 levels), before hosting the Leaders\u2019 Summit on Climate. Biden clearly intends to take a lead role and align the US with their resubmitted NDC target of net zero by 2050. To an extent, US businesses were already driving change even under the Trump administration, with reductions in emissions averaging about 0.4% per year over the last decade, driven mostly by the shift from coal to renewables.6 The Biden administration pledges to accelerate the transition by spending billions on clean energy-related infrastructure and energy efficiency improvements. This spending, alongside extensive tax credits for renewables and an ambitious clean energy standard, should support his claim of a clean energy revolution in the US.7 However, the larger reconciliation bill containing many of the Democrats\u2019 climate initiatives will need to win the approval of a number of hesitant Democratic senators, including Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. In 2019, West Virginia was the second largest coal producer in the US and coal made up 91% of the State\u2019s electricity mix.8 EU UPS ITS AMBITIONS WITH \u201cFIT FOR 55\u201d Europe has long seen itself as a leader in tackling climate change and continues to make strong progress. European Union (EU) GHG emissions fell by 24% between 1990 and 2019, while its economy grew by approximately 60%9. In December 2019, the EU adopted the European Green Deal to advance the goal of net zero by 2050. In July 2021, the European Commission proposed \u201cFit for 55\u201d, an extensive legislative package to support a more ambitious, shorter-term cut in GHG emissions of at least 55% by 2030. We believe carbon prices through the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) are already disincentivising the use of cheaper coal; in 2019, following a sustained higher allowance price, Europe saw a larger decline in the use of coal.10 INDIA: YET TO GET ON BOARD WITH NET ZERO COMMITMENTS India\u2019s emissions have grown steadily over the past decade and it is now the world\u2019s fourth highest emitter, behind only China, the US and Europe. However, India\u2019s per capita emissions intensity is 60% lower than the global average and about seven times lower than that of the US. Developing nations such as India have contributed comparatively little to global emissions and may justifiably feel aggrieved in having to adopt stricter climate change targets.11 At the July 2021 G20 Energy and Climate Joint Ministerial Meeting, India signalled it would soon strengthen its existing commitments but cautioned that developed nations should move towards net zero sooner than 2050, to free up \u2018carbon space\u2019 for developing nations to grow. However, India\u2019s emissions growth and the burdensome physical effects of climate change on the nation,12 evident for example in changing rainfall patterns, highlight the need to contribute to lowering global emissions. Despite rapid growth and falling prices for renewables (solar being around 14% cheaper than coal),13 the Indian government is encouraging more coal mining and production. Uptake from the private sector has been slow, highlighting difficulties in funding new coal deployment globally.14 JAPAN BACKING ITS AMBITIONS WITH INVESTMENT IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES Japan recently announced measures to support its net zero goal by 2050, and to reduce GHG emissions by 46% by 2030 from 2013 levels. While Japan already benefits from an energy-efficient economy, some heavy industrial processes require high-temperature which could prove stubborn to further decarbonise. To combat this, Japan plans to invest heavily in hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technologies. In addition, Japan\u2019s transition plan will see natural gas\u2019s contribution to electricity generation almost halve from 2019 levels of 37%, to 20% by 2030. This is notable, as Japan is the largest global importer of liquefied natural gas, for example representing around 21% of global imports in 2020.15 Similar drops in coal usage will be offset by highly ambitious deployment of renewables which could make up 38% of Japan\u2019s electricity mix by 2030. This may serve as a warning for producers who see gas as the natural replacement for coal in the medium term. UK: HALFWAY TO NET ZERO The UK was one of the first major economies to legislate a net zero target by 2050, despite having notable oil and gas reserves \u2013 around 10-20 billion barrels of oil equivalent.16 Winding down UK oil and gas production may help to achieve the nation\u2019s climate goals; however, we note controversial plans to approve a new North Sea project.17 Nevertheless, in 2020, the UK was halfway to meeting its 2050 net zero target, having reduced emissions by more than 50% from its 1990 levels. A large contributor is a shift in the energy mix towards renewables, a shift which since 2015 has been supported by the UK\u2019s Carbon Price Support. This support, which is effectively a tax, was found to have accelerated coal\u2019s decline in the UK\u2019s electricity mix by over 90%.18 This demonstrates how effective a robust carbon pricing mechanism is in aiding the transition away from coal. SECTOR CARBON FOOTPRINTS: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES Against this somewhat uncertain policy backdrop, companies will be expected to adapt their businesses. A recurring theme is the need for transitioning from fossil fuels, particularly coal and oil, to renewable sources, as well as long-term improvements in electrification and energy efficiency. We believe this is key to aligning with national ambitions. However, like national initiatives, the rate of change remains stubbornly slow, necessitating an immediate policy response to reduce emissions in the short term to avert climate disruption. Utilities Electricity and heat generation make up 31.9% of global GHG emissions,19 and this figure is only likely to grow. To lower emissions, the transition to clean renewable energy in our electric system needs to accelerate. As a result, utilities are one of the most exposed sectors to carbon pricing risk, making their transition plans an essential part of their value proposition. The step-up in the EU\u2019s net zero ambition and the Biden administration\u2019s clean energy standard are likely to lead to further tightening in the global carbon markets and regulations, with significant implications for the utilities sector. According to the Transition Pathway Initiatives\u2019 (TPI\u2019s) State of Transition Report 2021, global electric utilities have reduced their emissions significantly, primarily due to reductions in the use of coal and increased use of renewables. US utilities are on track to meet their 2030 targets, but TPI found they will miss 2050 targets at current rates.20 Emerging economies remain reluctant to phase out coal. Coal is the dominant fuel in both China and India\u2019s electricity mix, representing 58% and 51% respectively.21 The sector needs continued large-scale investment, but companies should benefit from first mover advantages. We believe the current policy traction will be a tailwind for those utilities that have embraced the energy transition early on. Due to the cost advantages of renewables, utilities across the world should continue to phase out fossil fuels, especially coal, while accelerating solar and wind deployment to meet near-term reduction targets. These efforts to decarbonise their energy mixes will be key to how we assess utilities\u2019 comparative advantages. Utility companies\u2019 Scope 1 emissions tend to be comparatively high. We believe those that can decarbonise their portfolios in an efficient manner can reduce their carbon pricing risk and may use their resources more efficiently. Over the long term we believe a utility company will be more profitable if it makes more efficient use of its own resources, so we can expect companies with low scope 1 carbon intensity to outperform. Oil &amp; Gas NET ZERO TARGETS RARE It will become increasingly important for oil and gas companies to be disciplined in their capex plans as the energy transition accelerates, positioning themselves for the long term. Setting net zero targets is still rare in this sector according to Climate Action 100+, and even fewer include Scope 3 emissions in their plans.22 Addressing Scope 3 emissions is crucial for the Oil &amp; Gas sector as 85-90% of lifecycle emissions occur as fossil fuels are combusted. We note that the IEA recently recommended that exploitation and development of new oil and gas fields must stop this year if we are to reach net zero by 2050.23 This is broadly in line with UCL research from 2021 that estimated 60 percent of global oil and gas reserves must be left unexploited by 2050, though a portion of those fuels could be produced in the second half of the century.24 This raises risks for investors. Considering the typical oil and gas project generally have a life span between 15 and 30 years, capex decisions now may result in value destruction and stranded assets over the life span of the project. We believe investors should monitor investee companies\u2019 capex plans carefully. Reducing Scope 3 emissions over the long term may signal a company\u2019s commitment to sustained sustainable value. LEANING ON CARBON CAPTURE, UTILISATION AND STORAGE (CCUS) AS A SOLUTION Instead of reducing Scope 3 emissions from the combustion of their products, the industry has leaned towards increased capital expenditure on speculative technologies to assist them in exploiting their reserves. The oil and gas industry accounts for more than 35% of overall spending on CCUS,25 and we believe spending will accelerate. US majors have led investment in this technology. While capturing carbon may well play an important role in meeting global climate goals, the gap between what is required and what is possible remains large. We therefore remain cautious as overreliance on future utility of these immature technologies to achieve climate targets could further delay emissions reduction. In lieu of feasible, climate stress-tested investments, and without significant strategic shifts, we believe oil and gas companies may be better served using cash to deleverage and increase distributions to shareholders. Transport DRIVEN BY REGULATORY PUSH Transport represents about 24% of direct CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, of which road vehicles contribute about three quarters.26 Automobile manufacturers already face numerous national and supranational vehicle fleet emissions and fuel efficiency regulations, including in large economies such as Japan, China and the European Union. An increasing number of governments including Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom and Canada have announced dates by when the sale of new internal combustion cars will be banned. These regulations, combined with rapid advances in battery technology,27 should drive demand for electric and hybrid vehicles. ELECTRIC VEHICLE (EV) SALES MUST ACCELERATE Growth in sales of electric cars has strengthened over the past decade, with global stocks of electric passenger cars passing 5 million in 2018, an increase of 63% from the previous year. However, this is still only about 2.6% of global car sales and roughly 1% of the global fleet in 2019.28 \u00d7 Display 2: Electric car stock by region and technology, 2013-2018 \uf065 Source: IEA www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2019 \u00d7 Display 2: Electric car stock by region and technology, 2013-2018 Source: IEA www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2019 To achieve net zero, it is estimated that zero emissions vehicles will need to make up about 60% of global new car sales by 2030.29 This will likely require sustained policy support and further advances in innovation to achieve cost parity. Given the size of the opportunity, we expect to see automobile manufacturers further transitioning towards electric fleets. This scaling up and increased cost competitiveness could help sustain growth in sales and push us towards decarbonisation. Over the next decade we believe heavy emission-tied fines and loss of market share will penalise manufacturers who do not prioritise the transition, while policy initiatives and investment flows continue to reward those that lead the way. Financials While the financial sector can play a large role in determining our path to net zero30 through its direct and indirect influence on the economy, many areas of the financial sector remain intertwined with fossil fuel interests and funding.31 However, the investments required for a green global economy are enormous. With the proliferation in national net zero targets and climate measures amongst large economies,32 we are likely to see additional regulation in the financial industry. We believe this carrot and stick approach is driving the industry\u2019s interest in various net zero initiatives. The financial sector is impacted by climate change in several ways. Firms that are particularly exposed to more carbon-intensive businesses through their loan books or investment portfolios may be poorly positioned if regulation or technological change renders these sectors less viable. On the other hand, those that seize the green opportunity can enjoy the potential for increased revenues and the reputational benefits that come with being a green enabler. We believe it is important to consider which institutions are leaders or laggards by analysing financed and portfolio emissions as well as how financial institutions influence their customers and investee companies to align on a net zero pathway. Conclusion As the window for addressing climate change rapidly closes, we believe the world will continue to step up with bolder climate action. We believe the market will reward innovation and penalise inaction. An attempt at continued high-carbon growth is likely to be value destructive as a result of increased technological and regulatory change. Innovation in low-carbon solutions will be the critical driver of both economic growth and strong emissions reductions. Considering this, we believe investors will continue to demand their portfolios are aligned to both mitigate the risks and potentially capture the opportunities that the low-carbon transition presents. \u00d7 1 https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/ 2 N.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser\u2019s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio\u2019s investments in commodity-linked notes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to additional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio\u2019s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. ESG Strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 Andrew Harmstone Managing Director Global Balanced Risk Control Team Li Zhang Head of ESG, Global Balanced Risk Control team Global Balanced Risk Control Team Christian Goldsmith Executive Director Lead Portfolio Specialist", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/climate-transition.html"}

{"content": "Companies create carbon emissions, both directly and indirectly, that cause harm to society. We believe that globally economic and regulatory policy changes are on the way which will aim to reduce green premiums (the additional cost of a clean technology alternative compared to traditional, higher emissions options) and thus increase the cost competitiveness of sustainable options. We anticipate that the burden and liability of emitting carbon will ultimately fall on companies, and that the fundamental analysis that investors do today needs to reflect a price on carbon. At Counterpoint Global, our US-based strategies are comprised of companies that create fewer emissions per revenue dollar than the companies in the benchmark. For example, the carbon emissions per revenue dollar in the Growth Portfolio is less than half of the benchmark, while the carbon intensity estimate of the portfolio, the emissions per invested dollar is roughly one-fifth the index. As a result, our clients tend to have significantly less exposure to carbon intensity per invested dollar than they would if they invested in the benchmark. \u00d7 Our analysis of carbon emissions provides a signal to companies and clients that we are factoring in these costs as part of our analysis and valuation. Executives and boards who know that active managers are quantifying the risks of carbon emissions may have more of a financial incentive to allocate corporate resources to the innovations that we need to decarbonize as a society. We believe that the next wave of sustainability investing is to partner with companies to unlock opportunities for favorable impact. We call this convergence: the alignment of long-term value creation and positive impact on society and the environment.

{"content": "Much of the discussion in financial markets in recent months has been about peaks: peaks in economic growth rates, Covid infection rates and (more recently) inflation rates. This makes lots of sense. Growth, Covid and inflation are key factors for the global economy and financial markets, and markets are forward-looking. The focus, therefore, is normally on what will happen in the future \u2014 are things getting better or worse? Are they getting better or worse faster or more slowly? \u2014 rather than what is happening right now. \u00d7 However, sometimes focusing on the third (or even fourth) derivative of a variable is not always useful. For example, many of the business and economic sentiment indicators peaked in the second quarter and have been declining since then, even if they are still at elevated levels versus history. We believe these series are the most timely indicators of the economic growth outlook, and hence their decline is a source of concern: Growth is slowing, so government bonds should rally and risky assets should sell off! Yet, markets have not really moved in synch with the data this year, which is most likely because of the extraordinary economic circumstances we have been in: sentiment indices rose to record levels earlier this year, as economies were expected to recover very rapidly from lockdowns. Indeed they did, and now growth has started to moderate as things get closer to normal. Nethertheless, this moderation doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the economic expansion is now over, and falling sentiment indices most likely don\u2019t reflect growing recession risks, as they have often in the past. In short, focusing too much on the changes in the growth rate distracts from the fact that the growth rate remains at a healthy level. And the very unusual state of the global economy means sentiment indices are not likely to have their usual power in predicting when the economic cycle is starting to come to an end. The key point sometimes missed is that, in most developed economies, economic growth has been strong and the outlook remains robust. We believe this provides a supportive environment for risky assets and means central banks can start moving towards tapering the emergency support they provided in response to the epidemic. Similarly, Covid infection rate curves have been a focus of many investors (and a growing army of armchair epidemiological statisticians). Rising infections have been a source of concern for investors (and mankind). However, the economic impact of rising infections has been changed by rising vaccination rates, which has altered the link between infections and hospitalisations and deaths. In addition to the fact that infection waves have been very different across countries, the economic impact of those waves is also becoming different. This means trying to develop an investment thesis based on Covid infection rates is getting harder! The other peak which investors are looking for is the one in inflation. In spite of the very high prints we have already experienced, it\u2019s not clear if we are at the peak yet, as the inflation data continue to surprise on the upside. And even if we have seen the highest figures already, many economists now expect the year-on-year prints to stay at current levels for another 9 to 12 months. Rather than forecasting a sharp peak, the consensus is now more for a high plateau from which we will decline only in the second half of 2022. The issue for inflation is not so much if we have seen the peak yet, but for how long will inflation remain elevated, and will this push inflation expectations higher and force central banks to act? The point is that in these unusual times, trying to pick the turning point in different trends might not be a useful exercise. It\u2019s probably better to focus on things we can know with more certainty: the economic outlook remains positive; Covid continues to pose downside risks; higher inflation looks like it is transitory. but investors should stay vigilant to central banks starting to worry if it stays high for too long. In terms of our market views, we remain long risky assets (corporate credit, higher yielding non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), emerging markets) because of the positive economic outlook and strong fundamentals, and in spite of credit spreads being tight relative to history. We think government bond yields will move higher as central banks look to taper, but we do not expect a disorderly sell-off. \u00d7 Display 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date \uf065 Note: USD-based performance.

Fixed Income Outlook For once August was a relatively quiet month for markets, as it is supposed to be. Equities continued to grind higher, credit spreads were largely unchanged and developed market government bond yields were modestly higher. The sanguine attitude was in spite of some important central bank meetings, in particular the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s annual offsite at Jackson Hole, economic data which was either mixed or deteriorating, and inflation numbers which continue to surprise substantially to the upside. Why were the markets so calm? In our view, the main reason is that, while the economic data has been moderating rapidly, it is still consistent with strong levels of economic growth. In particular, it is the forward-looking economic surveys which have moderated sharply. However, they are still at levels that are consistent with healthy economic expansion, and some moderation was always to be expected given they were previously at record highs. The very rapid pace of recovery from economic lockdown couldn\u2019t be sustained forever, and to some extent the current slower growth rates just reflect the extent to which economies have been able to bounce back already. The same positive growth picture can be seen in equity markets, where Q2 earnings generally beat expectations, hence providing a fundamental justification for the strong equity performance seen to date. Credit markets have been supported by a collapse in bankruptcies and in most cases corporate and household balance sheets are in the best condition they have been in in years (thanks to the largesse shown by governments in response to the crisis). In addition, central banks remain committed to keeping liquidity conditions easy. Of course, the story isn\u2019t rosy everywhere, with the Covid delta variant leading to surging infection levels even in developed economies with high vaccination rates. This appears to be more of a problem in the U.S., where patchy vaccine take-up and limited social distancing measures mean higher infections are causing another wave of hospitalizations and deaths; the same is not happening in Europe, where vaccine take-up is now surpassing the U.S. The market consequence has been for the Fed to moderate its hawkishness, but it\u2019s not the only central bank to have eased off due to Covid: for example, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) chose not to raise rates due to a Covid breakout leading to a lockdown in the country. In general, though, central banks are eyeing how and when to unwind the extraordinary policy measures they introduced in response to Covid. The U.S. Federal Reserve discussed this at their August meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) will do so at their September meeting, and there basically isn\u2019t a central bank anywhere which hasn\u2019t started tapering or talking about how it will taper. Asides from some very modest yield rises over the last month (and some widening of euro sovereign spreads), this has not really caused markets concern. Why? Well, from the perspective of risky assets (equities, credit, etc.), higher yields are a response to improving macro-fundamentals; while not helpful by themselves, the boost from the better macro picture matters more. Second, markets have already anticipated central banks normalizing policy, so to the extent they are moving no quicker than investors have already priced in, it shouldn\u2019t push yields higher. Third, as mentioned above, it seems clear that central banks will ease off tightening if they see any risks to the economy, from Covid or other sources. What could threaten this benign outlook? One obvious risk is inflation, given large upside inflation surprises everywhere this year, which could pose a threat to central banks\u2019 price stability mandates. So far central banks have been very sanguine about the numbers, seeing them as resulting from transitory shocks and bottlenecks in the global economy. These should pass relatively quickly and, in our view, are not a good reason to tighten monetary policy. However, if some of the inflation increase becomes more permanent, leading to higher inflation expectations, then there might be reason to act. This is even more the case where rising prices can be linked to low interest rates from monetary policy, e.g., the housing market and housing costs. Where does this leave our views on markets? On government bonds, we expect yields to rise over time, but not sharply as long as any tapering is done gently. We expect U.S. treasuries to remain range-bound in the next few months with a bias towards higher rates from current levels. We are modestly overweight investment grade credit: spreads are tight, but fundamentals are good, and it\u2019s better to earn some additional carry than not.1 We have a larger overweight to high yield, although still a medium sized position, favoring Bs vs. BBs; once again, spreads are tight vs history but fundamentals are attractive and higher commodity prices should also help. We see non-agency RMBS as particularly attractive from a risk-adjusted return perspective, but are underweight Agency mortgage backed securities (MBS) due to demanding valuations and the expected tapering of Fed purchases. We are overweight emerging markets due to being long an idiosyncratic collection of names rather than owning the asset class broadly. Developed Market (DM) Rate/Foreign Currency (FX) Monthly Review Developed markets were quieter as the summer came to an end. However, infections from the Covid delta variant continued to pick up momentum, which, coupled with continued concerns around inflation and growth prospects, created uncertainty in markets. Yields were generally higher across the developed markets. Outlook The second half of 2021 marks the next phase of the pandemic-driven-economic-cycle that is past the initial peak in growth, inflation and monetary and fiscal policy support. Policy is still expected to be a dominant driver of asset performance, but the recovery in the economy to date means it make sense that policymakers are eyeing how they will dial back emergency support measures without threatening the economic recovery. While we do not expect a dramatic sell-off in government bond markets, we think the risk is skewed to yields rising, as markets price in the path to monetary policy normalization. We expect inflation to remain high for some time, but that the surge is mainly transitory, although there is a risk that higher inflation proves to be more sustained. We judge G10 currencies to be close to their medium-term fair values. The USD no longer benefits from notably better than expected economic data than other G10 economies, and the Fed is probably in the middle of the pack in terms of its dovishness, except for the ECB and Bank of Japan, who are more dovish. Emerging Market (EM) Rate/FX Monthly Review EM debt returns were positive in August. Hard currency sovereigns delivered positive returns, predominantly driven by tighter spreads. EM Corporates were also positive, with high yield outperforming investment grade corporates. Local currency bonds posted positive returns due to stronger EM currencies versus the U.S. dollar.2 From a sectoral perspective, companies in the Real Estate, Metals &amp; Mining, Transport led the market, while those in the Diversified, Consumer and Industrial sectors underperformed. Outlook A less hawkish-than-expected Jackson Hole Fed summit last month may provide support to Emerging Markets in the weeks ahead, in addition to pre-existing factors such as the relatively attractive valuations across EM assets, high commodity prices, and continued improvement in vaccine rollouts in EM. Medium-term risks to our benign view for EM assets, besides setbacks in the Covid pandemic, include a delayed transition to fiscal consolidation which could drive EM risk premia higher, as well as rising geopolitical risks that could weigh on market sentiment. Credit Monthly Review Credit spreads were slightly wider in Europe and the U.S. over the month. Equity market strength and lower volatility supported credit markets broadly.3 Outlook We remain fundamentally constructive on credit, and although valuations are demanding, we expect spreads to consolidate at these levels. Financial conditions will likely remain easy, which will support the continuation of the rebound in economic activity, and low corporate default rates. We expect corporates to maintain profitability with conservative balance sheet strategies as overall macro uncertainty remains high. Finally, there is likely continued demand for credit in general as risk-free assets offer negative real and absolute yields, and excess liquidity looks to be invested. Securitized Products Monthly Review August was a quiet month overall, with new issuance slowing from its Q2 and early summer pace, and very minimal secondary trading activity.4 Interest rate volatility declined during the month, and rates remained largely range-bound, although the curve steepened. Agency MBS spreads widened in August, bank buying of agency MBS has slowed, and talk of potential Fed tapering of its MBS purchases continued to weigh on the market. U.S. Non-agency RMBS spreads were essentially unchanged. U.S. asset-backed securities (ABS) spreads were slightly tighter again and U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) spreads were largely unchanged. European RMBS, CMBS and ABS activity was very light as both new issuance and secondary trading volumes remain very low. European securitized spreads were largely unchanged during the month. Outlook We believe the securitized market offers a unique combination of low duration, attractive yields, and solid credit fundamentals. We remain constructive on securitized credit and have a modest credit overweight across our portfolios. We remain cautious on interest rate risk, and we continue to manage the portfolios with relatively short duration. \u00d7 1 Bloomberg US Corporate Index.

There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. \u00d7 Global Fixed Income Team Our fixed income investment capabilities are driven by eight specialized teams \u2013 Agency MBS, Emerging Markets, Floating-Rate Loans, High Yield, Investment Grade Credit, Municipals, Multi-Sector, and Securitized \u2013 which span the global fixed income capital markets.

If the jet stream (the high-altitude winds circling the Northern Hemisphere) is being disrupted, the usefulness of past weather patterns for predicting future patterns and the probability of extreme climate events are called into question. The summer of fire and floods has also raised questions about whether disaster recovery plans are correctly aimed at tributaries as well as main rivers, the role of dams in subverting the natural course of rivers, whether heat waves should be named and rated like hurricanes, and how meteorologists should communicate warnings to the general public. \u00d7 \" Even a moderate emissions scenario will see temperatures rise by 2.1 to 3.5 degrees Celsius over the next 20 years After July 2021 produced the hottest global monthly average temperature on record, the heat is still on ahead of the COP26, the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow. The August release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, compiled by more than 200 scientists, suggests that even a moderate emissions scenario with little change in today\u2019s global development patterns will see temperatures rise by 2.1 to 3.5 degrees celsius over the next 20 years. Achieving global warming targets lower than that \u2013 to avoid irreversible glacier retreat, Arctic ice cover loss or ocean warming \u2013 requires \u201cimmediate, rapid and large scale\u201d reductions in greenhouse gases, with a growing focus on methane from natural gas fields and cattle and its significantly higher warming potential than carbon dioxide. The European Union\u2019s Fit for 55 policy proposals are more likely to be taken seriously against a backdrop where the dangers of climate risk seem more pressing. The European Commission is beginning to plot a road map towards more carbon taxes and new carbon border adjustments for polluting industries (i.e., carbon tariffs), phasing out petrol and diesel car sales by 2035 across the bloc, while encouraging renewable industries and protecting carbon sinks like forests and other ecosystems that are crucial to carbon balance in the atmosphere. The winds of change focused on inequality have also seen the proposal of a Social Climate Fund to support those disproportionately disadvantaged by rising costs. U.S. Democrats are proposing carbon import tariffs in response to this, raising the bar on climate policy, while China has launched its own national emissions trading scheme \u2013 now the largest in the world. So, what do we think about climate change, and how does our team manage our responsibility to adapt to the growing importance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability concerns? \u00d7 \" Pathways to reduced emissions may create opportunities for low-carbon solution providers; regulation could reduce profits In our view, climate change presents an array of risks and opportunities for companies, and these are high up on the list of issues which we consider, case by case, including whether and how material they are to the sustainability of any company\u2019s returns on capital. Pathways to reduced emissions may create opportunities for low-carbon solution providers, but regulation including taxation and carbon pricing could reduce profits. Extreme weather may impair physical assets or interrupt business activity. Energy transition may result in stranded assets and wasted investment. Further, companies that are not adapting or that are moving more slowly than the competition could risk their reputation and potentially lose customers. As part of our integrated approach to ESG factors, we seek to directly engage with our companies to evaluate their position on climate change. Each company has a different starting point, a different exposure and is typically at a different stage in its decarbonisation journey. Our climate and carbon company engagements typically address areas including governance, targets, transparency, implementation, progress, physical risk, product and service opportunities and stakeholder alignment. Our global portfolios, ever bottom-up, and invested in sectors with high intangibles and low tangible assets relative to other sectors, enjoy the benefit of a smaller physical footprint and lower physical risk of extreme events relative to other sectors. Key holdings in software typically have a low carbon footprint per unit of revenue, as well as emerging opportunities to sell much-needed tools to help their clients measure and minimise their environmental impact. The direct footprint of staples and health care factories and distribution fleets remains significantly lower than the index, although that doesn\u2019t minimise our focus on their efforts; typically, in these engagements, we focus on areas such as sustainable sourcing, packaging and other indirect (Scope 3) effects. \u00d7 \" Our global portfolios invested in sectors with low tangible assets enjoy the benefit of lower physical risk of extreme climate events In the first six months of 2021, we engaged on ESG issues with our companies on 81 occasions, of which 55 engagements focused on environmental issues. We are systematically and intensively engaging with our companies on their decarbonisation strategies. But an improved environment cannot be achieved through decarbonisation alone. Companies (and fund managers) need to be increasingly conscious of \u2013 and help find solutions for \u2013 excessive natural resource depletion, waste and water intensity and their impact on biodiversity. As such, our systematic engagements with companies focus on a broad spectrum of ESG topics, particularly those material and germane to the company in question. We have our work cut out for us. An uncertain environment of climate change, geopolitical posturing, and rising rather than receding incidence of new COVID-19 variants around the world mean that, while we remain alert to potential opportunities, we continue to steer towards caution, focus on sustainable earnings and cash flows, direct capital towards ESG-aware management and emphasise valuation discipline. \u00d7 Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy\u2019s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 Laura Bottega COO and Head of Client Experience, International Equity Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/advance-warming.html"}

{"content": "Looking at the performance of U.S. Treasuries (and other developed government bond markets) in both nominal and real terms, one could be forgiven if one believed the economy was sinking, the Fed was easing, and/or inflation was falling. Nothing could be farther from the truth! Other financial asset prices are sending a different message. Indeed, the U.S. and global economy are doing just fine, even if growth is not turning out to be quite as strong as expected a few months ago. But, even most of that can be explained by supply side/production problems. Aggregate demand remains robust; economic reopening (as measured by performance of the ISM services index) is improving and employment growth is robust (especially given the recent July report released August 6th). Other asset prices are sending the signal that all is well on the economic front as equities continue to rally and credit spreads remain relatively firm. What gives? \u00d7 In fact, this phenomenon began earlier in Q2; it\u2019s just that July\u2019s rally has taken yields much lower than almost anyone had expected (circa 1.2% on the U.S. Treasury 10-year note). To put things in perspective, real yields made new lows in July, meaning they are now lower than they were at the peak of the pandemic or at the low in nominal yields in September of last year. During this period, as we all know, inflation continued to surprise to the upside, on all measures, even taking into account supply disruptions and Covid-induced anomalies. Not surprisingly this has elicited worrisome comments from several Fed officials and market participants. Market analysts have put forward a whole host of reasons for the surprisingly strong performance of government bonds. Technicals, not fundamentals, is what we hear most. This explanation encompasses a whole host of explanatory factors including expectation adjustments, market positioning (less likely in July although news of some large losses at a hedge fund does suggest a market imbalance remained), Delta variant fears, relatively high U.S. yields compared to other countries, excess reserves in banking sector, Treasury funding and its balances at the Fed, and hawkishness of some Fed officials. The explanation is probably all of the above but, most importantly, the largest contributor is excess liquidity/savings in the world. In a world awash with cash and cash yields zero almost everywhere, money has to go somewhere. Where does that leave us? Government bond yields everywhere are unlikely to go lower even with the Delta variant complicating return to work and reduced social distancing. Central banks want easy policy but nowhere have they said they want easier policy! With real yields plummeting in the U.S. and elsewhere, this constitutes material easing of financial conditions. With economies growing strongly; inflation rising; inflation expectations more importantly no longer low or falling, central banks should not want to increase accommodation further. Indeed, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Norway have already taken measures to reduce accommodation (not embark on tightening, mind you, just reducing accommodations no longer needed). However, to send bond yields back up, markets need a catalyst and we believe that catalyst is likely to be time: Time for labor markets to continue to heal; time for central banks to be confident economies will not falter; time for higher inflation expectations to stabilize. This could easily begin in the fourth quarter. \u00d7 Display 1: Asset Performance Year-to-Date \uf065 Note: USD-based performance. Source: Bloomberg. Data as of July 31, 2021.

Fixed Income Outlook Aside from the sharp rally in government bonds, not a whole lot has changed over the last month. Equities grind higher (albeit with a lot of dispersion), credit spreads\u2014both high yield and investment grade\u2014remain well supported, if not a little soft on the back of elevated supply. From this perspective asset allocation views have not changed. The rally in government bonds came to a halt on August 6th with the strong U.S. employment report, but that may not be the last we\u2019ve heard from that sector. While the data confirmed the Fed\u2019s expectations that good progress is being made on the economic and particularly employment front, \u201csubstantial\u201d progress is likely still a bit away. A few more months of data, particularly those encompassing the back to school and back to work and ending of Federal supplemental unemployment benefits will be necessary to cement in confidence that the economy no longer needs emergency like accommodative monetary conditions. Then and only then will the Fed and probably other central banks be confident that there will be no back sliding. Certainly, the surge in Covid cases due to the spread of the Delta variant has not made the decision easier. That said, there have been no signals that central banks view the Delta variant as completely derailing the recovery. Consensus that the Fed will give guidance on tapering in September looks reasonable with actual tapering most likely starting early 2022. The next big issue for the Fed and the market will be what this means for the path of rate hikes. This issue remains to be hashed out and will be a source of market volatility in the months ahead. Another major source of volatility will be the discrepancy between current market forecasts of the terminal Fed funds rate of 1.5% and the Fed\u2019s forecast of it being 2.5%. Who is right will determine the extent to which yields can rise above previous highs of approximately 1.75% on the U.S. Treasury 10-year note. We believe a terminal rate of around 2% is reasonable which pushes fair value of 10-year U.S. Treasuries to around 1.75%, near previous high earlier this year. Whether this happens this year or next will be highly data dependent and how economic data and inflation expectations evolve over the next few months. Economic data released in July showed a very strong U.S. and global economy, even if a little softer than earlier envisaged. Nonetheless, the U.S. economy grew in real terms at more than a 6.5% annualized rate in Q2 and at more than a 16% annualized rate in nominal terms. Even if the economy slows next year to 4%, that is still strong enough to reduce unemployment back to pre-Covid levels in 2022, a pre-condition for the Fed to raise rates. That said, risks still abound with respect to the Delta variant as all of this strong data, including the July employment report, occurred before the Delta induced Covid surge, at least in the U.S. Optimism is the right attitude, dosed with a small amount of concern. Data watching will be in strong vogue in the weeks ahead. As mentioned earlier, nothing significantly changed in the fundamental outlook to cause changes in asset allocation. Credit market valuations remain high but deservedly so given macro fundamentals and the liquidity the corporate sector has been able to acquire. Defaults and downgrades are at rock bottom levels and deservedly so. Outside of specific idiosyncratic risks to particular industries, like energy, or certain companies involved in reopening/disruption risks, the corporate outlook has never been better as seen by continued record earnings results. We continue to overweight HY, securitized credit and more cyclical IG sectors to reflect these sound fundamentals even though bargains do not exist. If U.S. Treasury yields (or European government bond yields) move higher we could see spreads tighten anew. In the interim, owning these sectors for their carry makes excellent sense. Emerging markets (EM) as they are wont to do represent a mixed bag. There are a lot of idiosyncratic risks, from politics to monetary and fiscal policies. Several EM central banks including Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and Hungary have seen it necessary to raise rates to rein in inflation expectations despite still in early Covid recovery period. Political noise in countries like Peru have also surfaced as have regulatory clampdowns in China. We remain opportunistic in EM looking at each country on an individual basis and not making broad asset class decisions at the current time. The bottom line is that an investment strategy focused on a continuation of low but gently rising nominal (and in particular real) yields, strong growth (in output and incomes), rising vaccination rates, and stable policy remains intact. \u00d7 Developed Market (DM) Rate/Foreign Currency (FX) Monthly Review In July, concerns around the spread of the Delta variant and its threat on the economic recovery consumed markets. The prospect of high inflation seemingly took a back seat in investors\u2019 minds, as the sustainability of the economic rebound caused a new wave of concern. Yields fell sharply over the month across the developed markets, with the 10-year Treasury yield ending the month at 1.22%. The U.S. Dollar traded sideways to slightly weaker over the month. Outlook Recent data and information flow continue to imply 2021 and 2022 economic activity will be very strong, even if recent data is coming out weaker than expected (except for inflation which is still surprising to the upside). Rising case counts as a result of the Delta variant now present a potential headwind to the U.S. and global economy getting back to trend growth. Even though some economies have recovered quicker from the COVID-19 economic shock than anticipated, they are still operating significantly below their estimated capacity, especially in the services sector. We expect the current high elevated inflation to continue, with year-over-year rates only declining in 2H22. While inflation has continued to surprise to the upside, it is still our view that the surge is mainly transitory, due to base effects, higher commodity prices, temporary bottlenecks in the economy and statistical issues. In the coming months, we also expect central banks to begin to slow or to announce their intention to begin slowing asset purchases. We judge G10 currencies to be close to their medium term fair values. The USD no longer benefits from notably better than expected economic data than other G10 economies, and the Fed is probably in the middle of the pack in terms of its dovishness. Emerging Market (EM) Rate/FX Monthly Review EM debt returns were positive overall in July. Hard currency, as represented by the JPM EMBI Global Diversified, returned, 0.4%, predominantly driven by lower U.S. Treasury yields. EM Corporates were also positive for the month according to the JPM CEMBI Broad Diversified Index, with high yield underperforming investment grade corporates. Local currency bonds posted negative returns, due to weaker EM currencies versus the U.S. dollar. From a sectoral perspective, companies in the Pulp &amp; Paper, TMT and Industrial sectors led the market, while those in the Real Estate, Metals &amp; Mining and Utilities sectors underperformed. Outlook Despite ample monetary policy support in the developed world and attractive valuations of EM assets, we notice a marginal deterioration in market sentiment as of late. We remain cautious on EM Fixed Income assets in the weeks ahead on the back of disappointing data on the spreading Delta variant and plateauing vaccination. Credit Monthly Review Credit spreads over the month were flat in Europe and widened in the U.S. Risk-free yields moved lower globally, as curves flattened with long- dated paper outperforming. News on increased cases of the Delta variant were a key driver of sentiment although vaccinations continued to roll- out and economies like the UK saw restrictions lifted as the summer holidays started. In addition, volatility was seen in Chinese credits which led to negative ripple effects outwards, following concerns that government intervention was increasing in housing, health and education. Market Outlook We remain fundamentally constructive on credit, although valuations look fully priced. We expect financial conditions to remain easy, which will support the continuation of the rebound in economic activity, and low corporate default rates. We expect corporates to maintain conservative strategies as overall macro uncertainty remains high. Finally, there is likely continued demand for credit in general, as risk-free assets offer negative real and nominal yields. Securitized Products Monthly Review July was another active month of new issuance and relatively quiet month of secondary trading activity. Interest rate volatility increased, with the market testing lower rate levels, as concerns over a slowing economic recovery and renewed threats from the COVID Delta-variant weighed on the market. Agency mortgage backed securities (MBS) spreads widened in July as volatility increased, bank buying of agency MBS slowed, and talks of potential Fed tapering continued to weigh on the market. U.S. Non-agency residential mortgage- backed securities (RMBS) spreads and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) spreads were essentially unchanged in July. U.S. asset-backed securities (ABS) spreads were slightly tighter again in July. European RMBS spreads tightened again in July as both new issuance and secondary trading volumes remained very low. Outlook We believe the securitized market offers a unique combination of low duration, attractive yields, and solid credit fundamentals. We expect the new securitized issuance to slow in August which should be a positive technical factor for credit spreads overall. We remain constructive on securitized credit and have a modest credit overweight across our portfolios. We remain cautious on interest rate risk, and we continue to manage the portfolios with relatively short duration. \u00d7 1 Source: Bloomberg, as of June 30, 2021 The views and opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Management team as of August 2021 and are subject to change based on market, economic and other conditions. Past performance is not indicative of future results. \u00d7 RISK CONSIDERATIONS Diversification neither assures a profit nor guarantees against loss in a declining market. There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a portfolio. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower-rated securities. High-yield securities (junk bonds) are lower-rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default, and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand for a particular currency; trade; fiscal, money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies; and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, and correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third-party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the portfolio could sustain a loss. \u00d7 Global Fixed Income Team Our fixed income investment capabilities are driven by eight specialized teams \u2013 Agency MBS, Emerging Markets, Floating-Rate Loans, High Yield, Investment Grade Credit, Municipals, Multi-Sector, and Securitized \u2013 which span the global fixed income capital markets.

While messaging remained generally consistent with the prior month\u2019s meeting, the Federal Reserve (Fed) upgraded its stance on the economy, noting that it has \u201ccontinued to strengthen.\u201d In consideration of preparing for balance sheet tapering, Chairman Powell indicated that the economy has made progress toward the Fed\u2019s employment and inflation goals but data have not been \u201csufficient\u201d to warrant policy shifts. Current policy continues to be viewed as \u201cappropriate,\u201d and the committee will \u201ccontinue to assess progress in coming meetings.\u201d European Central Bank1 At the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) policy meeting on July 22, President Lagarde and the policy committee left the ECB deposit rate unchanged at -0.50%, as expected. The committee kept the size of the pandemic emergency purchase program (PEPP) and asset purchase program unchanged in July. While monetary policy was held steady, President Lagarde and the Governing Council tweaked their stance on forward guidance. In what\u2019s being viewed as a more accommodative approach, the ECB plans to keep rates at current or lower levels until \u201cinflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilizing at 2% over the medium term.\u201d Bank of England1 Although no formal policy meeting was held in July, analysts expect the Bank of England to leave monetary policy and the quantitative easing program unchanged in August. While expectations for policy shifts have been subdued, analysts anticipate the Monetary Policy Committee to portray an optimistic attitude regarding the economy. \u00d7 Display 1: Monthly Interest Rate Summary as of 7/31/21. \uf065 Source: Bloomberg. \u00d7 Display 1: Monthly Interest Rate Summary as of 7/31/21.

Source: iMoneyNet PORTFOLIO STRATEGY PRIME STRATEGY3 Throughout the month, broader market volatility caused by concerns over the spreading delta variant did not flow through to the money market space, with 3-month LIBOR4 rallying to set at an all-time low of 0.11775% on month-end. With a flat curve not compensating investors to extend maturities and take on additional credit and interest rate risk, we remain patient in our investment approach, waiting for dislocations in pricing before putting capital to work. Portfolio WAM (weighted average maturity) and WAL (weighted average life) organically rolled down throughout the month, with weekly liquidity remaining elevated in excess of 50%. GOVERNMENT/TREASURY STRATEGY5 In July, yields remained compressed and the curve flat with most Treasury bill auctions stopping between 0.04% and 0.05%. Extreme amounts of cash in the front end kept the volume rising in the reverse repurchase (RRP) facility, hitting a new high at $1.039 trillion on July 30. In the first half of July, we continued buying 6-month bills then largely ceased purchasing these bills in the latter half of the month, as we felt comfortable with current extensions and portfolio duration profiles. At month-end, the debt ceiling suspension ended, and in August, the government began using extraordinary measures to remain below the debt limit. We remain vigilant of potential Treasury exposures near the debt ceiling \u201cdrop-dead date.\u201d Although the date is a moving target, we currently expect it to be in October. Markets are not pricing any debt limit disturbances yet and we hope Congress will address the limit in short order. In the meanwhile, we sold off several Treasury positions and reinvested into overnight repos or other Treasuries given the lack of much yield effect to do so. We continued to invest a significant amount of cash in overnight repurchase agreements and to manage the portfolios to be responsive to changes in market conditions and interest rate levels. TAX-EXEMPT STRATEGY3 At the short end of the municipal curve, yields for variable rate demand obligations (VRDOs) declined during the month of July. The SIFMA Index,6 which measures yields for weekly VRDOs, dropped 0.01% to 0.02%. Yields at the longer end of the municipal money market maturity range dropped as supply remained constrained. The Bloomberg BVAL One-Year Note Index7 finished the month at 0.06%, down 0.08% from the prior month-end. The short-term tax-exempt market is expecting to see continuing strong demand throughout the next month with the support of redemptions and forthcoming August cash. \u00d7 1 Source: Bloomberg. 2 Weighted Average Maturity (WAM): Measures the weighted average of the maturities of the portfolio\u2019s individual holdings, taking into account reset dates for floating rate securities. 3 The Portfolio will be required to price and transact in their shares at a floating net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) and will be permitted to impose a liquidity fee on redemptions or temporarily restrict redemptions in the event that the Portfolio\u2019s weekly liquid assets fall below certain thresholds. 4 The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is the short-term interest rate that banks charge one another and that is generally representative of the most competitive and current cash rates available. 5 Government and Treasury Funds are Stable NAV funds. 6 The SIFMA Municipal Swap index is a 7-day high-grade market index comprised of tax-exempt VRDOs reset rates that are reported to the Municipal Securities Rule Making Board\u2019s (MSRB\u2019s) SHORT reporting system. 7 The Bloomberg BVAL One-Year Note Index represents tax-exempt municipal bonds that have an average rating of AAA by Moody\u2019s and S&amp;P.

{"content": "Growing $10,000 at an annualised rate of 8% a year would become $14,693 in five years, $21,589 in 10 years, and be worth more than four times as much in 20 years at $46,610\u2014a strong real appreciation of capital.1 This compounding is fundamental to successful long-term investing, as long as you have the patience for it. \u00d7 While the rate of compounding matters, the key lies in the ability to keep doing it. This is why we look to hold companies with high and sustainable returns on operating capital1, since these companies exhibit the best compounding characteristics, in our experience. The things that matter There are a few key attributes essential to achieve these high and sustainable returns: pricing power, hard-to-replicate intangible assets with high barriers to entry, and a leading presence in industries and categories with strong, long-term opportunities for growth. Also vital is a management team able to allocate capital effectively, to drive this growth and navigate the ever disruptive sea of change \u2013 you can\u2019t compound if you\u2019re not growing. Pricing power matters for two reasons. First, it may protect you in both inflationary and deflationary conditions; you can pass on input cost inflation to the end consumer if your costs of goods rise, and you can uphold your pricing if these commodity-driven costs decline. Second, it means you could have better control over your gross profit margin \u2013 you can keep it stable. A high gross margin (our global portfolios average 50% compared with the broader market of 26%) is the signal of pricing power. By definition, if you are not able to offset inflationary or deflationary conditions, you would not be able to maintain a high gross margin. High gross margins help support sustainable growth. As an example, take a leading French beauty company. Its gross margin is 70% and its operating margin is 20%. This means 50% of its sales are operating costs (70% minus 20%). These operating costs are the engine room of innovation, sales, marketing and research and development. It means the company can, and does, spend 30% of its revenues on marketing alone, supporting and building its world-leading brands. The average company simply can\u2019t compete, given the average company has a gross margin of 26%. If the average company spent 30% of revenues on marketing, it would make an immediate loss. So high gross margins do two things: they help support high barriers to entry, and they underpin stable profits. Hard-to-replicate intangible assets are powerful because they enjoy high barriers to entry and durability. Favourite consumer brands, from sports shoes to shampoo, typically have many, many years of investment crafting and positioning the brand, tuning it to changing tastes, keeping it relevant, keeping it desirable, and ensuring ready access in-store and online. Leading global technology software franchises have built such strong platforms \u2013 entwined in the heart of all we do at work and at home \u2013 that switching costs deter us from moving to an alternative. Why take the risk? Why invite the cost? And who is there to switch to anyway? As long as the provider supplies us with what works and they innovate to keep relevant, then there\u2019s no switch to be had. Sure, disruptors come along, especially in technology, but typically the disruption helps lift the boats for the most powerful franchises. New digital payment players use the incumbent rails of the established debit and credit card companies \u2013 new players benefit from the existing infrastructure. Games, app and social media developers write for the incumbent desktop and mobile operating system suppliers; they need them. We invest in companies with the ability to grow sustainably over the long term, where this growth is rooted in sound fundamentals at justified prices. We don\u2019t engage in the risk of very high expectations for growth, regardless of price, or in exciting businesses on the cusp of discovery with a distant prospect of turning a profit, or the promise of a new way. We want to ensure the industries and categories our companies are in, or are developing, have a genuine road map for long-term growth. For example, attractive opportunities in digital payments, enterprise-wide networks, beauty and personal care, medical technology, financial and business software, health and hygiene as well as environmental solutions are all reflected in our portfolio \u2013 all backed by world-leading, well-established franchises. And the things that can\u2019t be ignored Further safeguarding the potential for compounding, throughout our investment process, we consider the material risks and opportunities that ESG issues may pose to the sustainability of returns. Ignoring, for example, the impact of climate change and the need to decarbonise could impair a company\u2019s competitive advantage and reputation all at once. Failing to develop brand equity that speaks to consumers wanting, for example, natural provenance, recyclable packaging, lower carbon footprints or informative labelling, is failing to safeguard the franchise. Not investing in an appropriate framework to confront cybersecurity risk could significantly compromise operations and profits. Not optimising a talented corporate culture by neglecting to foster diversity and inclusion signals further risks to the franchise. We bring these conversations to the table through engagement with the company rather than forming an opinion using only third-party scores or data points. Where can it go wrong? The returns will not remain high and sustainable if the management teams in control of allocating shareholder capital do so unwisely. Highly profitable businesses that require limited capital \u2013 because they\u2019re driven by their intangible assets \u2013 produce significant levels of free cash flow and have powerful balance sheets to deploy. This financial capacity could be a risk in the wrong hands. In essence, a lot of money can be spent very quickly at the wrong price for the wrong assets for the wrong reasons. Management might be trying to mask slowing organic growth, they might be accelerating short-term earnings growth (if they\u2019re incentivised to do so), or they might have captured the right asset, but at a very high cost. How can we control for this? Through fundamental analysis and engagement. We look to understand if their incentive structure risks short-term behaviour. When we can, we meet with management to understand how they think about the allocation of capital (where, how and why) and how they\u2019ve allocated it in the past, and come to our own conclusion as to the risk or opportunity. Being long-term holders with very low portfolio turnover facilitates this ongoing dialogue. In a world where daily financial chatter looks to dot plots, talking about talking about tapering, non-farm payrolls, the crypto helter-skelter, the stimulus tap, hydrogen or lithium ion, transitory or persistent inflation, commercial space travel, bad news is good news, good news is bad news, it\u2019s easy to get distracted from what drives the core of long-term returns; the power of compounding. That\u2019s what we relentlessly focus on owning and checking and checking again, and then again: that we have a portfolio of those rare companies with the ability to compound at a high and sustainable return on their operating capital. \u00d7 1 The example shown is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent actual market returns. The data has been chosen to convey the concept of compounding. Results are hypothetical. \u00d7 Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy\u2019s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 William Lock Head of International Equity Team International Equity Team Alistair Corden-Lloyd Executive Director Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/back-to-basics.html"}
{"content": "A Mantra for Valuing Cash-Generating Assets We suggest the mantra \u201ceverything is a DCF model.\u201d Whenever investors value a stake in a cash-generating asset, they should recognize they are using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. This suggests a mindset that is very different from that of a speculator, who buys a stock in anticipation that it will go up without reference to its value. The topic deserves attention because many market participants don\u2019t think DCF models are relevant, and many use heuristics for value without recognizing the purpose and limitations of the shorthands. The intrinsic value, determined by the present value of future cash flows, attracts the price like a magnetic force. This means it is useful for investors to keep in mind the value drivers of a discounted cash flow model. \u00d7 Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Counterpoint Global consists of 54 people, including 30 investors, four disruptive change researchers, two consilient researchers and two sustainability researchers.

{"content": "Today, private equity represents 11% of the average portfolio allocation, significantly above the 4% allocation in 2005.1 Despite this increase, one could argue this level of adoption is still below the optimal exposure given the asset class\u2019 strong performance relative to public equity.2 Increasing duration and the associated illiquidity, in our view, are the reasons why this allocation gap persists. However, we believe that there are solutions available within the private equity industry to check or reverse this upward trend in duration and allay investors\u2019 concerns about increasing their allocation to the asset class. \u00d7 Prior to the Global Financial Crisis, approximately 40% of private equity portfolio companies were sold within three years of acquisition. From 2009\u20132020, however, the average holding period has increased by 31%.3 As a consequence, the median time it takes for a private equity fund to liquidate fully is now longer than 13 years, while the average term for a PE vehicle remains at 10 years.4 Although funds can be extended, Limited Partners (LPs) have become increasingly frustrated with the frequency at which fund durations exceed a decade. Logically, the longer hold periods for these investments have led to greater capital needs for the existing portfolio (often described as \u201cfollow on\u201d investing). The quantum of follow on capital has increased meaningfully since 2009, with add-ons representing 72% of all private equity deal flow in 2020 compared with 57% in 2009, straining the capital reserves that exist within the PE fund structures.5 This mismatch of duration and capital needs has a variety of root causes. The typical private equity fund structure has not adapted to the growing and maturing private equity market. The ten-year fund life structure, which was perhaps fitting twenty-five years ago, is still the backbone of the vast majority of funds today. As the private equity market has become more competitive and, hence, more efficient, General Partners\u2019 (GPs) value creation plans often take longer to execute than expected, elongating hold periods. Thus GPs have often wanted to hold on to their \u2018winners\u2019 in order to maximize their potential value. These situations frequently create conflict between GPs and LPs and among the LPs themselves\u2014some of whom want to stay on for a longer period of time, while others demand nearer term liquidity. In our view, three solutions have emerged to combat the duration dilemma while allowing the GP to continue to manage a particular investment. One answer to this challenge has been the launch of longer duration or even evergreen private equity funds such as those introduced by a number of reputable firms such as Apollo, KKR, and Carlyle. In our opinion, while these funds are a natural solution to this issue and a laudable business extension for these private equity firms, they appear unlikely to penetrate the private equity market on a broad level. We believe only the largest private firms are able to provide investors with comfort that the governance, talent and focus required will continue to exist over these extended fund lives despite the fact that few professionals are likely to stay engaged for the full duration of the vehicles. Furthermore, few investors in private equity funds have a structure that allows them to participate in such a long-dated vehicle. Another answer is the sale of positions held within funds that have surpassed their fund life to another fund of more recent vintage that is managed by the same private equity firm. This solution enables the manager to continue owning an asset that is viewed as attractive. However, a conflict of interest stems from the fact that a GP acts as a seller and a buyer simultaneously. In certain cases, a GP may not transfer 100% of the ownership of the asset into the more recent fund, creating misalignment of interest. In our experience, there are only a handful of situations in which these issues were examined and addressed when Limited Partner Agreements (LPAs) were in the draft stage. As such, a number of LPs have struggled with lack of transparency, information asymmetry and limited time and resources to fully diligence such transactions. Most problematic is the fact that, in most cases, there is not an independent third party responsible for pricing these transactions. We believe the best solution to this problem has come from the private equity secondaries market. The most common transaction type within this space is the acquisition of a diversified portfolio of limited partnership interests by a dedicated secondaries fund.7 A select number of secondary buyers, however, have abandoned this practice a number of years ago in favor of a more concentrated approach that enables them to isolate and invest in assets that they believe offer the greatest return potential. These transactions are alternatively known as \u201csingle-asset lift outs\u201d, \u201ctransformational secondaries\u201d or \u201cGP-led secondaries\u201d. This segment of the market has expanded significantly in the past two years; Evercore estimates the single-asset market has ballooned from $2Bn in 2018 to $14Bn in 2020.6 Secondary buyers in these instances work with GPs to create vehicles that will hold one or more \u201cwinners\u201d that the GP wants to continue to own and/or attractive investments that require more time to achieve their full growth potential. Single-asset lift outs may provide significant benefits to both GPs and LPs. First, they allow GPs to continue to manage certain holdings for a longer period of time and provide them with follow on capital for use when needed. Second, they offer existing LPs the option to cash out or to remain invested for a longer duration. Managers that pursue concentrated strategies benefit from the GP\u2019s deep knowledge of a specific asset and exposure to the assets with the greatest return potential within the GP\u2019s portfolio. The magnitude of the recent evolution in the secondary market came as a surprise to many market participants, with total secondary deal volumes doubling from 2016 to 2019.8 We believe that single-asset lift outs will serve as a catalyst for the continued growth of the secondary market and, more importantly, address the duration concerns that may be preventing asset allocators from dedicating a greater proportion of their assets to private equity. \u00d7 1 Preqin Investor Outlook \u2013 Alternative Assets.

{"content": "We believe the next decade is unlikely to mirror the last. We witnessed the second-longest bull run in history with the S&amp;P 500 index rising more than 16% annually since March 2009 followed by one of the sharpest recessions on record due to the COVID-19 pandemic (as illustrated in Display 1).1 In our view, predicting the exact duration of the current economic recovery post-COVID-19 is impossible but building a portfolio that seeks to withstand it is essential. We believe that this preparation requires applying a multidimensional investment methodology and discarding conventional wisdom in order to construct a portfolio to perform well in both economic downturns and subsequent periods of outperformance. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: S&amp;P 500 Index Return March 2, 2009 \u2013 June 30, 2021 \uf065 1 S&amp;P Capital IQ \u2013 S&amp;P500 Index, as of June 30, 2021.

Calculated as Index price returns. Past performance is not indicative of future results. While historically defensive sectors\u2014 such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples\u2014have long been considered \u201csafe\u201d areas to invest and cyclical sectors have been perceived to have higher risk, we believe painting broad brush strokes about sectors and cyclicality is ineffective as a guideline for constructing a potentially resilient portfolio. Rather, we believe that deep evaluation of company fundamentals alongside a clear understanding of industry forces is critical to the success of creating a portfolio that seeks to withstand the next market downturn. Since its inception in 2000, AIP Private Markets has collectively committed $20.5 billion to over 950 private equity transactions.2 Through this experience, we formed an investment philosophy that we believe helps enable us to endure challenging environments and to thrive in robust market conditions. Therefore, with a forward-looking lens, we developed a three-pronged framework for seeking to select potentially resilient companies with strong value creation prospects that entails the following 1. Identifying efficiency producing businesses with exposure to stable end markets One of the challenges to investing resiliently is to identify businesses that will grow in both benign and challenging market conditions. One such niche that we believe has this characteristic includes companies that provide a solution or service that lowers the overall costs for customers, and therefore improves margins. Such offerings can be the result of minor or major technological advances or services that better fit the current needs of customers; often solving problems that did not exist 10-15 years ago. Businesses that focus on producing such efficiency can consistently do well through market cycles as they improve the profitability of their customers and are subsequently deemed essential, agnostic of where in the market cycle they are implemented. For example, we invested in the largest private label oral care manufacturer in the United States. Over the past decade, retailers have experienced declining footfall and, in some cases, declining revenues. In response, many retailers materially increased their promotion of private label brands which are typically cheaper for end consumers and could be 3x as profitable as branded goods.3 As a consequence, consumption of private label brands has risen. The private label oral care manufacturer that we invested in is a significant player in this space and, in our opinion, is the chief beneficiary of this trend. As a result, this business has been able to grow even in a period where revenues for retailers are broadly under pressure.4 In a similar contrarian vein, we acquired a medical scribe company that serves medical providers including both hospitals and outpatient physicians. Our internal view is that healthcare providers will face both revenue and cost pressures going forward due to the U.S. government\u2019s desire to control overall healthcare spending and a continued shortage of both doctors and nurses. However, this company provides material efficiencies to these providers by solving issues related to the recently implemented electronic medical record systems (\u201cEMR\u201d). This business provides qualified medical scribes that complete the EMR notes. This company has grown revenues organically at a rate of nearly 30%5 and we believe that its growth can continue even in more challenging environments for medical providers due to the cost savings the company provides.6 2. Partnering with highly aligned and specialized investment partners In our view, assessing resiliency involves dissecting the experience base of owner/ operators and the payouts they receive from their compensation plans in both up and down markets. We seek to align ourselves with highly specialized private equity sponsors and management teams with proven track records of executing value creation plans and navigating operational challenges in the specific industry they invest in. We seek to achieve a strong alignment of interests with our partners by investing in businesses where the current sponsor/ manager of the asset believes in its go-forward value creation potential and their compensation structure encourages both capital preservation and generation of strong returns for investors. By way of illustration, we invested in one of the leading healthcare providers of respiratory products. The company operates in a highly fragmented subsector ripe for industry consolidation. The value creation thesis going forward was predicated upon pursuing a consolidation strategy. Such a buy-and-build strategy, in our view, requires an experienced team that can identify and execute add-ons successfully. In the case of this company, the management is led by a CEO with 27 years of experience in this particular healthcare niche who had already completed over 60 accretive tuck-ins since 2006. The private equity sponsor is purely focused on growth-oriented companies in the healthcare sector and brought deep and complementary experience in the segment to this investment. The sponsor, who was the current owner of the asset, believed in the trajectory of the asset and they agreed to roll all proceeds generated from the profit share during their prior ownership alongside us in this transaction and to make a meaningful additional commitment to the investment from their personal balance sheets. Through this alignment mechanism, we sought to ensure our partners were incentivized to both preserve capital and produce positive investment returns.7 As another example, we purchased a platform of franchise boutique fitness brands in 2018. The CEO has a demonstrated track record of scaling fitness businesses, even through the global financial crisis. Confident in the value creation potential going forward, he rolled over his entire stake in the business to this transaction. Additionally, the option pool was increased for the management team and structured with performance hurdles. The private equity sponsor in this transaction is a highly regarded growth investor that has focused on the boutique fitness space over the last eleven years. This sponsor also made a considerable investment alongside us. This degree of alignment and experience is representative of what we seek in our partners to effectively manage businesses across economic cycles.8 \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: Leverage and Pricing Multiples \uf065 \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: Leverage and Pricing Multiples 3. Seeking value on the buy with businesses exhibiting high cash flow generation and conservative leverage Investors architecting for resilience, we believe, are almost certainly concerned with the peak absolute pricing levels paid for assets in the current market, but many may forget that further fragility is added when we consider the impact of leverage. With average valuations hovering around 14x in the U.S. private equity market and 14.5x in the public equity market9 (as illustrated in Display 2), the environment continues to be challenging for investors seeking high quality companies at attractive prices. Nevertheless, we remain disciplined in seeking to purchase assets at discounts to fair market value and with strong relative value. The average entry multiple across the investments we closed in recent years is 11.1x EBITDA.10 We believe that the key to accessing value in frothy markets is to take a proactive approach to deal sourcing. Through our relationship-driven sourcing efforts, we seek to generate proprietary deal flow that allows us to invest in high quality companies at reasonable purchase prices. However, in our view, an attractive purchase price provides only limited safeguards in a downturn if the company is over levered. Although current leverage multiples have surpassed pre-crisis levels, we maintain our focus on conservative capital structures. The average debt/EBITDA ratio for our investments made in recent years is 4.1x EBITDA11 versus market leverage of 6.3x EBITDA.12 In addition to leverage, we also assess a company\u2019s cash flow characteristics to seek to determine how stable, recurring, or sensitive they are to cyclical fluctuations. We seek to acquire highly cash flow generative businesses that continue to provide value to equity investors through downturns. Conclusion There are many strategies to look at when seeking to build a resilient portfolio. Our experience has led us to develop a framework for selecting companies and constructing a portfolio that seeks to withstand changes in the economic cycle. They should be well-capitalized, led by strong management teams, and fall within pockets of growth in less cyclical industries.

{"content": "Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors are most often discussed in the context of corporate and sovereign debt issuers, while they have been largely neglected when it comes to mortgage and other asset-backed securities. The main reasons for this include the complex legal structure of securitized transactions, which require multiple levels of due diligence by the investor to assess the sustainability characteristics of the underlying loans or assets, combined with the current lack of sufficient and granular ESG data for these underlying investments. However, we expect the quality and quantity of available information in this market to evolve rapidly, as client demand amongst institutional investors grows.1 \u00d7 At Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM), we believe that ESG considerations are an essential component to investing in securitized markets, and that a thoughtful ESG integration approach can result in better performance as well as better alignment with positive impacts on the environment and society. This is why we have developed a proprietary sustainability framework for our portfolios, leveraging the specialist knowledge of our analysts and investment team. Our approach is based on three key steps, as presented in Display 1: In-depth analysis of the specific E, S, G characteristics of each deal; Scoring of the deal on a 1-5 scale, based on its overall ESG profile; Mapping of the positively- and negatively-scored deals to the applicable United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), for consistent tracking and reporting of a portfolio\u2019s overall sustainability.alignment \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: MSIM Securitized Sustainability Framework \uf065 This represents how the portfolio management team generally implements its investment process under normal market conditions.

See https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals for more details on the Sustainable Development Goals. 1. ESG Analysis at the Deal-level Our analysis begins by taking into account the nature of the underlying loans, borrowers, properties or assets, loan originators and servicers of every deal we assess, to identify the key E, S or G risks and opportunities associated with the collateral as well as the lending practices. For the evaluation, we rely on three primary sources for ESG information: deal documents, due diligence discussions with originators and servicers, and public announcements from the various government regulatory agencies. Due to wide variations in the structure of mortgage- and asset-backed securities, ESG considerations can take different forms, as presented in Display 2, and we believe they can be directly linked to credit performance, impacting risk-adjusted returns both positively and negatively. \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: Key ESG Factors in Securitized Analysis \uf065 \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: Key ESG Factors in Securitized Analysis ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ARE EMPHASIZED IN OUR ANALYSIS OF COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (CMBS). Properties with potential adverse environmental impacts, such as large industrial plants, carry greater legal, default and liquidity risks. Conversely, we view buildings with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) or similar certifications based on environmental characteristics including energy and water efficiency in a favorable light, as we believe they tend to be associated with lower operating costs and higher occupancy and rental rates, translating to reduced credit risk for bondholders. SOCIAL FACTORS ARE MOST RELEVANT WHEN ASSESSING RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (RMBS) AND CONSUMER LOAN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES (ABS). Considerations for these types of deals are primarily related to the affordability of lending and the accessibility of the underlying loans to more vulnerable and underserved borrowers. However, the energy efficiency of properties and the environmental impact of collateral are also taken into account. GOVERNANCE\u2014IN THE FORM OF LENDERS AND SERVICERS\u2019 PRACTICES AS WELL AS PROPERTY OWNERS\u2019 BEHAVIOR\u2014IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF OUR ASSESSMENT. This is aimed at avoiding exposure to predatory lending and mitigating litigation risk. One of our integral due diligence questions asks about the current status of each lender and servicer with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and any other relevant regulatory agencies, to help us ensure fair lending and servicing practices are being applied. These details are tracked and documented by the investment team, as evidence of our regular screening for predatory lending across securitizations. Based on our experience investing in this market, we find that ABS bonds where lenders or servicers face pending regulatory action have tended to underperform those with cleaner track records over the medium- to long-term. Servicers facing regulatory issues also can carry greater risks of potential disruptions in loan servicing activity which can also have a negative impact on loan performance. In addition, when underwriting standards are weak and/ or if predatory lending is occurring, loans usually have a higher risk of default. For on- going loan servicing, we evaluate payment collection processes and foreclosure practices. Aggressive payment collection processes and foreclosure practices can lead to more defaults and prepayments. We also monitor the behavior of property owners and assess potential risks from their business practices and legal standing. This can be done via direct engagement with them, or by gathering additional information via third parties regarding eviction practices, environmental issues, and corporate governance. A pattern of poor business practices can indicate a heightened probability of legal issues which can affect loan performance. 2. MSIM\u2019s ESG Scoring Based on the analysis presented above, MSIM assigns an ESG score ranging from 1-5, 5 being best, to each deal. ESG scores are then applied to all tranches in a deal, based on the rationale that ESG factors are consistent throughout the entire structure. Some exceptions could apply, for example in the case of a rake in a CMBS deal, where a tranche within a larger deal is backed by different collateral than the rest of the deal. We view most residential, commercial and consumer lending to have a neutral ESG profile, which translates to an average ESG scores of 3 across our investment universe. We have taken a conservative approach in this regard, by assigning a score of 3 to standard responsible lending practices, with the thesis that responsible lending should be interpreted as a baseline, while scores of 4 or 5 are reserved for lending practices and/or assets and loans with outsized positive environmental or social characteristics. This is the case, for example, with buildings that have particularly robust LEED certifications (e.g. Gold or above, or equivalent), or ABS linked to renewable energy assets such as solar panels, which would be associated with a score of 5. \u00d7 DISPLAY 3: Mapping an Illustrative MSIM Securitized Portfolio\u2019s Alignment to the UN SDGs \uf065 This is shown for illustrative purposes only.

See https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals for more details on the Sustainable Development Goals. 3. Mapping SDG Alignment The third and final step of our framework involves mapping the securitized portfolio to the SDGs as an indication of its positive or negative sustainability alignment.3 This is consistent with our broader sustainable investing approach at MSIM Fixed Income, which involves the monitoring and reporting of our portfolios\u2019 net alignment with the SDGs across asset classes. Our mapping is done by linking positively and negatively-scored deals to the respective granular SDG Target, and then aggregating the total contribution at the SDG Goal level. For example, RMBS or CMBS backed by certified green buildings contribute to SDG Target 7.3 \u2013 \u201cDouble the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency\u201d, while solar panel ABS have a positive impact on SDG Target 7.2 \u2013 \u201cIncrease substantially the rate of renewable energy in the global energy mix\u201d. Together, these investments count towards overall portfolio alignment with SDG Goal 7 \u2013 \u201cAffordable and Clean Energy\u201d. Given the nature of underlying loans and assets, we find that most of the positive environmental contribution of our securitized portfolios tends to be related to SDGs 7, 9 and 13 on clean energy, sustainable industry and infrastructure, and climate action (specifically in terms of reducing carbon emissions). On the social side, our portfolios primarily contribute towards SDGs 3, 4, 10 and 11, with a focus on social wellbeing, access to and affordability of essential services. A Flexible ESG Approach in an Evolving Market Our MSIM Securitized Sustainability Framework is aimed at ensuring an objective and transparent ESG integration approach is applied across our mortgage- and asset-backed investments. Our approach also provides the flexibility, if desired by our clients, to tilt portfolios in favor of investments that have positive sustainability alignment. For example, as part of our sustainable portfolios that are allowed to invest in securitized debt, we aim at maximizing positive alignment by investing in deals with higher ESG scores, while minimizing exposure to negative scores. Finally, we recognize that the measurement and evaluation of sustainability in the securitized market is evolving. We are actively engaging with leading ESG research and data providers, and collaborating with sustainability experts across Morgan Stanley, to closely monitor availability of new datasets that can facilitate deeper analysis, such as physical climate risk at the property level, or social impacts reported by lenders for their housing portfolios, and that can help us refine our scoring and mapping frameworks over time. We believe the approach described above gives us a dynamic and flexible architecture within which to continue enhancing our sustainability integration methodology for the benefit of our clients and the strategies we manage for them. \u00d7 Download .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } 1 See \u201cESG Industry Engagement Survey 2020\u201d, Structured Finance Association (November 2020). 2 Acronyms: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB); Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC); Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); Department of Financial Services (DFS); Financial Servicers Authority (FSA); Financial Conduct Authority (FCA); Department of Financial Services (DFS); Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA); European Banking Authority (EBA); European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). 3 The United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a global blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future by 2030. The 17 goals and 169 targets cover a broad range of sustainability issues, from eradicating poverty and hunger to affordable and clean energy, to good health and a quality education for all. The SDGs provide a framework to advance sustainable economic growth, gender equality and climate action, among other priorities. They increasingly inform and are used as an assessment framework for MSIM\u2019s approach to investing, engagement and impact reporting. \u00d7 Risk Considerations ESG ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to portfolio holdings and do not remove the risk of loss. There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of the Portfolio may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. ESG Strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Mortgage and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the strategy could sustain a loss. High yield securities (\u201cjunk bonds\u201d) are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Foreign securities are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Inverse floaters are sensitive to early prepayment risk and interest rate changes and are more volatile than most other fixed-income securities. \u00d7 Gregory Finck Head of Securitized Fixed IncomeGlobal Fixed Income Team Navindu Katugampola Global Head of SustainabilityGlobal Fixed Income Team Barbara Calvi Sustainable Investing, Fixed Income &amp; Liquidity Erin K.

{"content": "As active asset managers with a focus on long-term value creation and responsible stewardship, effective engagement is a critical part of our investment process and fiduciary obligations. Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM) Fixed Income has developed a targeted and thematic engagement programme on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. Our approach is fully integrated into our research and investment processes to identify opportunities for improved risk management and alpha generation through constructive dialogues with issuers, while encouraging them to pursue positive sustainability outcomes. \u00d7 The Growing Imperative for Fixed Income Engagement Fixed income investors have an important role to play in building a constructive dialogue with issuers and supporting them in pursuing positive sustainability outcomes while enhancing ESG disclosure and price discovery of the proper cost of capital when accounting for ESG risks. While engagement and stewardship have historically been an equity investor remit, we believe fixed income investors are uniquely positioned to have a positive influence on issuers for a number of reasons: The responses to some of the world\u2019s key sustainability challenges, such as climate change and access to basic services, are going to require large capital investments that are primarily financed via debt instruments,1 including with sustainability labels. The vast majority of primary market financing is conducted in the debt market rather than in the equity market, giving fixed income investors a regular and direct interface with issuers seeking their capital. The magnitude of debt financing requirements increases in stressed scenarios (such as the recovery phase after the COVID-19 pandemic), increasing the frequency of such issuer/investor interactions and their importance in shaping issuer strategy. Fixed income portfolios typically hold a large number of securities and a range of issuers, in contrast to the more concentrated nature of holdings in active equities portfolios, giving investors a broad scope of engagement opportunities. Fixed income investors are uniquely positioned to engage with and influence issuers that do not have public equity outstanding, including Sovereigns, Supranationals/Agencies, many High Yield companies and state- owned enterprises. MSIM\u2019s Rationale for Fixed Income Engagement Our Fixed Income engagement programme aims to achieve three main objectives: Deepen our insight and understanding of the issuer and its sector; Push for better sustainability outcomes; and, ultimately, Capture alpha opportunities that may not be fully appreciated by the market. Insights from the engagement process can therefore result in changes to our Credit Analysts\u2019 assessment of the issuer. This may in turn lead to a decision to participate in a new issuance, increase or reduce our existing holdings in outstanding bonds, or \u201cwatch-list\u201d the issuer for our Sustainable Funds until more progress is made on the specific E, S or G issue of concern. Finally, we strive to provide the same level of transparency that we expect of issuers. We therefore track and report our engagements on a quarterly basis, including their outcomes\u2014i.e. whether they affected our investment strategy through the Analyst\u2019s recommendations or the Portfolio Manager\u2019s investment decision. The MSIM Fixed Income Approach to Engagement At MSIM Fixed Income, we view engagement as an indispensable and powerful component of our ESG integration approach and to implement our sustainable investing strategies2 (see Display 1). This is aligned with our 100% active management model and our duty as responsible stewards of capital.3 \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Engagement Is a Key Component of MSIM Fixed Income\u2019s ESG Integration Approach \uf065 \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: Engagement Is a Key Component of MSIM Fixed Income\u2019s ESG Integration Approach To this end, we have established an active engagement strategy that is based on three pillars (see Display 2) and is applied across fixed income asset classes. This structure is intended to: Help MSIM identify target companies for engagement based on material ESG considerations relative to their current stage of adoption of sustainability; Anchor the dialogue to a consistent set of thematic priorities that drive our key desired outcomes; and Implement engagement as part of our regular fixed income investment process, with Credit Analysts leading the dialogue with the support of the Fixed Income Sustainable Investing team. \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: MSIM Fixed Income\u2019s Three-Pillar Engagement Strategy \uf065 This represents how the portfolio management team generally implements its investment process under normal market conditions.

TARGETED ENGAGEMENT \u2013 INVESTING TO IMPROVE SUSTAINABILITY OUTCOMES AND RETURNS We select issuers to prioritise in our engagement programme based on the materiality of the ESG risks or opportunities they present. We rely on our proprietary ESG scoring models and research capabilities to determine and monitor any \u201cred flags\u201d on controversies or violations of international norms, and identify exposure to severe ESG risks. This risk mitigation-driven focus on ESG laggards is complemented by a strategic outlook on sectoral sustainability opportunities, where we engage with issuers that we believe have the potential to benefit from those positive tailwinds. Our goal is to identify those ESG improvers, whose progress might not yet be reflected in their public reporting and third-party ratings, as a potential source of alpha generation. Finally, we also engage in conversations with ESG leaders that already have advanced sustainability credentials, to encourage them to share best practices across their sectors, support the adoption of new disclosure standards, and promote innovative sustainable solutions. We approach issuer engagement constructively and collaboratively. Depending on the impetus for dialogue, the MSIM Fixed Income team seeks to set clear expectations from the engagement process. These can include the disclosure of specific data points, promoting the adoption of recognised ESG reporting standards, or suggesting alternative practices where we are concerned with a certain course of action taken by the issuer. We understand that the various fixed income asset classes are at different stages of development of their sustainability practices and ESG disclosure, and we adapt our engagement approach and expectations accordingly (as presented in Display 3). \u00d7 DISPLAY 3: MSIM Fixed Income Engagement Approach across Asset Classes \uf065 \u00d7 DISPLAY 3: MSIM Fixed Income Engagement Approach across Asset Classes 2. THEMATIC FOCUS MAPPED TO THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (UN SDGS) Our engagement priorities are based on salient ESG risks and opportunities at a sectoral level, reflecting our Credit Analysts\u2019 sector specialisation and our broader approach to ESG analysis. We have established a framework that maps these sector-level considerations to four \u201cmacro\u201d environmental and social themes, presented in Display 4, which help us define the desired outcomes of our dialogues with issuers and report on progress. \u00d7 DISPLAY 4: MSIM Fixed Income\u2019s Priority Engagement Themes \uf065 Source: MSIM, UNDESA.

As fixed income investors, we view governance as the strongest ESG driver of portfolio risk and return, and the pillar from which strong credibility is built across any sustainability-related topic. We therefore diligence corporate governance, transparency and accountability, and disclosure matters across all of our dialogues with issuers. Our thematic framework informs not only engagement, but also the active security selection process in our fixed income strategies, and is part of our broader commitment, at MSIM, to support investments that positively contribute towards the UN SDGs.5 3. INTEGRATED PROCESS LED BY CREDIT ANALYSTS ESG topics are included in all of our touchpoints with issuers\u2019 management and during roadshows, based on the thesis that we can be more influential in our engagement by regularly following up with issuers on a focused agenda of salient points as opposed to conducting sporadic, diluted sessions on a broad range of sustainability topics. For this reason, our fixed income engagement process is led by the Credit Research team based on an analytical, data-driven approach to evaluate ESG risk for the targeted issuers. Our Analysts have a deep understanding of the companies they cover and the engagement topics complement their comprehensive approach. The MSIM Fixed Income Sustainable Investing team contributes specific ESG expertise, ensures consistency across thematic engagements, and coordinates with the MSIM Global Stewardship team for equity-side insights. In cases where we identify significant sustainability risks or egregious conducts, we may conduct joint engagement with multiple MSIM investment teams, to leverage our broader business influence and address our concerns and expectations in a coordinated manner. Collaborative and Market-Level Engagement: Driving Best Practice and Standardised ESG Disclosure In addition to our one-on-one engagement programme with issuers, MSIM Fixed Income also collaborates with external partners and stakeholders to promote the adoption of best practices and international standards for sustainability disclosure, as shown in Display 5. \u00d7 DISPLAY 5: MSIM Fixed Income\u2019s Collaborative Engagement Initiatives \uf065 \u00d7 DISPLAY 5: MSIM Fixed Income\u2019s Collaborative Engagement Initiatives Genuine Dialogue Means Both Sides Become Wiser MSIM Fixed Income takes the view that the best form of issuer engagement is a process of dialogue, in which issuers are willing to consider alternative perspectives to help them evolve their approach to sustainability and investors are willing to change the assumptions and conclusions in their investment analysis. We aim to maintain a regular dialogue with issuers where we deem it most material. Consequently, many of our engagements are ongoing over a multi- year time horizon. This approach takes into consideration the time lag required for issuers to endorse new policies and sustainability targets, measure ESG impact, and reflect this information in the following period\u2019s public reporting. As responsible long-term investors, our goals from engagement are to support improving behaviour, facilitate meaningful change, and to use the insights we glean to drive returns for the benefit of our clients. \u00d7 1 See \u201cThe Butterfly Effect &amp; COVID-19: Six Implications for Sustainable Investing in an Interconnected World\u201d, Morgan Stanley Investment Management (link). 2 See Morgan Stanley Investment Management\u2019s Sustainable Investing Policy (link). 3 See Morgan Stanley Investment Management\u2019s Engagement and Stewardship Principles (link). 4 See \u201cAssess, Engage, Perform: The Value of ESG Integration within High Yield\u201d, Morgan Stanley Investment Management (link). 5 See Morgan Stanley\u2019s 2020 Sustainability Report (link). 6 The PRI\u2019s ESG in Credit Risk and Ratings Initiative aims to enhance the transparent and systematic integration of ESG factors in credit risk analysis (link).

{"content": "The shift in investments from tangible to intangible assets has important implications for how investors should think about corporate growth rates. Intangible assets have greater potential economies of scale and higher risk of obsolescence than tangible assets. This means companies with more intangible assets can grow faster, but they can also become irrelevant and shrink faster. Our analysis of historical sales growth rates for U.S. companies reveals both of these results: higher growth and more dispersion, on average, for companies and industries with the highest intangible asset intensity. There are two main lessons for investors: First, it is important to be mindful of the potential shift in the base rate due to the rise of intangibles. Second, skillful investors may be able to identify the companies that will grow faster than expected, hence providing the potential for attractive returns. \u00d7 Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Counterpoint Global consists of 54 people, including 30 investors, four disruptive change researchers, two consilient researchers and two sustainability researchers.

{"content": "Earth Day on April 22nd, with its theme of restoration, gave rise to a collection of new environmental pledges on the global stage. \u00d7 President Biden, seeking to reclaim global leadership in the fight against global warming, unveiled the U.S. goal of cutting emissions 50% from 2005 levels by 2030. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga raised Japan's target for cutting emissions to 46% by 2030, up from 26%, while Prime Minster Justin Trudeau raised Canada\u2019s goal to a cut of 40-45% by 2030 below 2005 levels, up from 30%. The recently agreed European Union (EU) Climate Law aims to reduce EU carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. Biden\u2019s move followed President Xi Jinping\u2019s emissions goal set last September with China seeking to achieve net zero emissions by 2060. There is hope that this will spur the next biggest emitters, India and Russia, towards improved pledges at COP26, the United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference in November this year. Closer to home, Morgan Stanley has pledged1 to mobilise $1 trillion in sustainable solutions globally that include helping prevent and mitigate climate change. \u00d7 \" Companies\u2019 Scope 1 and 2 emissions are just first steps towards solving climate change Within our team\u2019s portfolios, our companies have been busy too, encouraging consumers\u2014their customers\u2014to live more sustainably. There is growing recognition that companies\u2019 Scope 1 (direct or controlled) emissions and Scope 2 emissions (indirect emissions from purchase of energy) are just first steps towards solving climate change. Greater focus on Scope 3 (everything beyond 1 and 2, including energy customers consume when using a product) has begun to work its way not only into the consciousness of CEOs but also their advertising campaigns. Household companies see a revenue opportunity in identifying for consumers which small changes at home can make big changes for the planet. Consulting firms argue that the pandemic has intensified interest in \u201cconscious consumption\u201d. A U.S. multinational consumer goods corporation estimates that avoided emissions from low-energy laundry cycles since 2015 equals 15 million tons of CO2 or the equivalent of 3 million cars off the road. For context, in 2020 this company\u2019s scope 1 and 2 emissions were 2.6 million tons. Personal care companies now offer comprehensive sustainability programmes. Looking to accelerate already steady progress in its carbon footprint, the world's largest cosmetics company aims to reduce its carbon footprint by 50%, ensure 95% of its ingredients are from circular sourcing and invest \u20ac100 million in regenerating ecosystems. A German chemical and consumer goods company has launched a carbon footprint calculator to help consumers understand their personal CO2 footprint and contribute to sustainability through personal lifestyle choices. The scale of the Scope 3 challenge suggests there is work to do. It aims to save its consumers, customers and suppliers 100 million tons of CO2 cumulatively between 2016 and 2025. To date it has saved 50 million tons. Its 2020 Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 0.535 million tons. \u00d7 \" The scale of the Scope 3 challenge suggests there is work to do One of the world\u2019s largest software companies takes the prize for ambition, pledging to go carbon negative by 2030 and to remove, by 2050, the entire historical carbon emissions of the company since it was founded in 1975. A global payments company has announced its commitment to reach net zero by 2040 and celebrated carbon neutrality achieved in its operations in 2020. This company signing up to the Climate Pledge and Climate Business Network offers further examples of companies recognising the importance of not only solving but also being seen to be part of the global solution to climate change. \u00d7 \" Earth Day\u2019s announcements indicated an extension of consultants and IT companies seeking solutions to empower companies to decarbonise their supply chain Some companies, including a leading software and business solutions company, are seeking to spearhead the move towards a circular economy and a low carbon future with technology facilitating responsible design, sourcing, production, consumption, recovery and reuse. Consultants, already embedded in companies around the world, will play a key role in enabling other companies in the low carbon and energy transition. One consultant predicts (in \u201cThe Green Behind the Cloud\u201d) that migrations to the public cloud can reduce global carbon emissions by as much as 59 million tons of C02 annually. Earth Day\u2019s announcements indicated an extension of consultants and IT companies seeking to co-innovate and co-develop solutions for responsible production and design, empowering companies to decarbonise their supply chain and capture share in the circular economy. This follows similar consultant and IT company alliances of last year, joining with the UN Global Compact, to launch Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Ambition Guidance, an SDG achievement accelerator. We in the International Equity Team applaud these ambitions and actions, while recognising the challenges of achieving them, and we thought it would be helpful to articulate some of the steps we are taking in our team to accelerate positive change. 1. We recently enhanced the suitability criteria for our Global Sustain strategy. The Portfolio will seek to achieve attractive returns with significantly lower carbon emissions than the universe. We are working with our clients to join us in this objective where they see fit. 2. In order to achieve this objective for our Global Sustain strategy, we have introduced an explicit carbon screen to identify and filter out the highest carbon emitters in the universe. 3. Finally, we have introduced and have been executing for some months on a systematic engagement programme to question the companies we own on their sustainability initiatives, and how they intend to meet the goals they are setting. Clients of our other strategies also benefit from this additional engagement with our investee companies given meaningful overlap in holdings across our strategies. Such conversations also offer insights to management quality, corporate agility and capital allocation in the face of new risks. ESG integration today requires a facility not only with price and quality but with the third dimension of sustainability. We are conscious that there is always more to learn, but we believe our access and experience do give us an advantage in encouraging company managements towards a low carbon future. In this, as in everything we do, we remain ambitious. \u00d7 1 See: www.morganstanley.com/ideas/low-carbon-finance-1-trillion-dollar-pledge To reach the $1 trillion target, MS will work with corporations, governments and individuals to provide clean tech and renewable energy finance, green bonds and other transactions. \u00d7 Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy\u2019s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small- and mid-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 William Lock Head of International Equity Team International Equity Team Laura Bottega COO and Head of Client Experience, International Equity Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Global Sustain Portfolio MGQIX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/low-carbon-ambition.html"}
{"content": "Calculating Customer-Based Corporate Valuation \u00d7 This report focuses on the customer as the basic unit of analysis in understanding value. The idea of customer lifetime value (CLV) has been around for decades, but we believe that our discussion is richer and more nuanced than what many companies and analysts present. Two influential marketing professors introduced a framework called customer-based corporate valuation (CBCV), which links customer economics to shareholder value. CBCV\u2019s main contribution is that it provides a more robust way to forecast revenues than current models do. We discuss the key elements of the CBCV model, including customers, revenues, and costs. We show the limitations of common ratios such as customer lifetime value to customer acquisition cost (LTV/CAC). The report explores how companies can create consumer and supplier surplus, provides a case study on the postpaid segment of AT&amp;T Mobility, examines trade-offs in the drivers of value, and explores common errors. \u00d7 Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Counterpoint Global consists of 54 people, including 30 investors, four disruptive change researchers, two consilient researchers and two sustainability researchers.

{"content": "For over twenty years our unchanged investment philosophy for the global strategies we manage has been to own high-quality companies with the potential to successfully compound over the long term. These companies compound by steadily growing while sustaining their high returns on operating capital. As investors, we persistently look to identify material risks or opportunities to this compounding, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. \u00d7 We capture ESG risks and opportunities through our internally developed ESG scoring framework\u2014the Material Risk Indicator (MRI)\u2014a tool designed to record portfolio managers\u2019 ESG company assessments in a consistent and comparable way over time. The MRI helps to: identify material ESG risks and opportunities at the company level reflect these risks and opportunities in valuation and portfolio construction, if appropriate identify priority areas for future company engagement The fundamental question each portfolio manager (PM) must answer is whether the factors in question can significantly impair or enhance the company\u2019s long-term returns on operating capital employed, our primary quality metric. \u00d7 Display 1: ESG is Assessed by the Investment Team Directly Proprietary ESG MRI (Material Risk Indicator) Analysis \uf065 Source: Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

The views and opinions expressed herein are those of the portfolio management team, are not representative of the Firm as a whole, and are subject to change at any time due to market or economic conditions. There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective or an investment strategy will work under all market conditions. PMs are the ones who undertake the MRIs analysis as they best know the companies and industries. While we do use third-party ESG data for some of the inputs, this is a supplement to the analysis performed by the PMs. We believe our clients will benefit from this enhancement. The MRI is designed to improve our capture of risks and opportunities for the companies we invest in. This should further enhance our ability to manage downside risk as well as increase the potential for long-term compounding. How it works Each company is assigned a score from A through to E, with A being the highest score attainable. To determine this score, for each company, the relevant PM identifies and records the following: Key ESG risk(s), for example product safety or data security ESG opportunities, such as technology solutions for decarbonisation or waste reduction Investment implications from these risks or opportunities In addition, for the company in question, the PM will: Identify if there is a low, medium or significant level of concern with respect to the following team-agreed universal risks: \u00adGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \u00adGovernance (with a particular focus on management incentives) \u00adDiversity/culture (board, senior management, staff) \u00adSafety (product, broader workforce, environmental) \u00adData security/privacy \u00adTax (transparency, strategy, policy, risk). Document the key industry specific risk(s) Include quantifiable ESG data, currently comprising: Carbon tax impact on EBIT at $100/t of CO2e \u00adEquileap1 gender equality score \u00adImpact of normalised global tax rates \u00adPay X-ray score (our proprietary assessment of management incentives). How does the process impact portfolio construction? The nature of ESG factors can make it challenging to quantify their impact. As such, we employ a range of methods to reflect the outcome of our ESG analysis in the portfolio: Where feasible, we run scenario analyses e.g. forecasting the impact of an ESG factor on the company\u2019s growth rate, profits or capex and the resulting change in fair value \u2014 for instance, modelling the impact on profits and valuation of consumer staples companies switching to more sustainable packaging. We may adjust the WACC (weighted average cost of capital) to reflect the higher or lower risk. We may reflect potential risks by adjusting the position size, in addition to any model or WACC changes. Finally, we may choose not to invest in a candidate company if we believe ESG risks as assessed by the MRI are too high. It is important to note, however, that a high MRI grade does not automatically suggest a large position and a relatively low MRI grade does not automatically trigger a reduction or divestment of a holding. The ESG assessment is an important component of the research process, not the sole driver of investment decisions. The strengths of our approach It is entirely portfolio manager designed and driven. The MRI framework is not reliant on third-party assessments and data\u2014 these are simply a resource. We assign absolute, rather than sector-relative scores, which helps compare companies across different sectors, reflecting our bottom-up, absolute, benchmark-agnostic mentality. We focus on key ESG factors and their impact on the investment argument, rather than tick every possible (and possibly irrelevant) box. The MRI allows us to compare companies and identify leaders and laggards in specific areas, enhancing targeted engagement. The MRI is structured but not mechanistic\u2014the scores reflect the PMs\u2019 holistic view and are not constructed using a formula. Our process allows for team discussion and challenge. We can track changes over time. Conclusion When we assess stocks and make investment decisions, we debate their key merits and shortcomings as a team. We focus on those elements we believe are most impactful on the long-term sustainability of a company\u2019s return on operating capital, and rigorously break them down, including ESG factors. We believe the MRI strengthens our approach. It adds further structure, reference and integrity to our long-standing investment process, which is designed to identify reasonably priced, well managed, high quality compounders with a strong or improving ESG profile, across the globe. \u00d7 1 Equileap is a leading third-party provider of data and insights on gender equality in the workplace. \u00d7 Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective.

{"content": "Inc.'s annual Guide to the Top 50 Founder-Friendly Private Equity Firms is the go-to resource for investors that have entrepreneurs' backs--especially in a pandemic. Reproduced with permission of: BY GRAHAM WINFREY, SENIOR EDITOR, INC. \u00d7 FROM THE NOVEMBER 2020 ISSUE OF INC. MAGAZINE In May, as largely peaceful demonstrations over the killing of George Floyd were condemned by some who focused on sporadic violence and the destruction of a few small businesses, the satirical website The Onion published a story headlined \"Protesters Criticized for Looting Businesses Without Forming Private Equity Firm First.\" Private equity's dismal reputation stems mostly from a subset of buyout firms that invested in distressed companies, like Toys \"R\" Us, that then failed. The reality is that most U.S. private equity firms are interested in helping businesses grow, not grinding them to dust. To get the truth about PE, all you have to do is ask the founders who have used it to help them grow their companies while retaining an ownership stake. So that's what we did. Inc.'s second annual list of founder-friendly private equity firms shines a light on 50 shops that have had success supporting founder-led companies. To compile the list, we once again went straight to the source: entrepreneurs who have sold to private equity. It's a group that's been expanding for more than two decades. In the U.S., the number of PE-backed businesses has grown 30 percent compared with 2015, according to research firm PitchBook. While new private equity investments have slowed meaningfully since the onset of the pandemic, PE firms, armed with record amounts of capital, are completing more add-on acquisitions, which fold businesses into existing portfolio com\u00adpanies. For entrepreneurs who are now struggling, merging with a PE-backed rival could lead to the best outcome. \"We find a lot of situations where a PE firm will do an add-on acquisition and keep the founder on board,\" says Dave Brackett, co-founder and CEO of private credit manager Antares Capital, which has helped finance acquisitions for more than 400 PE firms. One plus to having a PE partner today, he adds, is the chance to benefit from strategies developed by the other companies in the firm's portfolio. \"They can take the lessons learned in some of them that are going well and share them quickly across those 20 to 40 portfolio com\u00adpanies to get those businesses performing more quickly,\" he says. For founders, taking investment from a PE firm during a downturn doesn't have to mean selling at a discount. \"You might think about a kind of delayed compensation arrangement in the form of earn-outs,\" says Ben Persofsky, executive director of the Center for Family Business at financial services firm Brown Brothers Harriman. \"Then there's still a provision that you can get rewarded for a good performance, as if Covid never happened.\" In this time of uncertainty, if you are considering private equity, first decide what kind of support you need, and then identify firms with that specific expertise. \"The comment 'know your investor' is probably doubly true now, particularly if it's a family business or a business you've been running for a while and you really care about your people,\" says Tom Stewart, executive director of the National Center for the Middle Market. \"You want to do your human capital due diligence as much as your capital due diligence.\" \u00d7 Morgan Stanley Capital Partners Morgan Stanley Capital Partners manages a middle-market private equity platform.

What options are available to investors wanting to lower the carbon footprint of their portfolio? How can a high-quality equity portfolio help? \u00d7 \" What options are available to investors wanting to lower the carbon footprint of their portfolio? How can a high quality equity portfolio help?\u201d This paper, the first in our Carbon series, sets out to explore these five areas. \u00d7 1. Climate Change 101 Climate change is widely seen as the defining issue of our time. In recent years, the political winds seem to have truly shifted, as the public has grown increasingly vocal and the issue more urgent. Climate science is not exact, given the number of assumptions scientists have to make about things they can\u2019t model exactly. Nonetheless, there is consensus that it is happening fast, it is man-made, we are not doing enough, and we should focus on preventing irreversible extreme damage. What matters for investors, in addition to the direct physical impact of climate change, is the resulting changes in government policy, consumer behaviour and the impact on companies and their valuations (the \u2018transition risk\u2019). The world is undoubtedly warming, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the most important global climate science body, comprising 195 member countries) expects us to reach 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels in only twenty years, if no action is taken (Display 1). \u00d7 WHAT IS MEANT BY TRANSITION RISK? \u201cWhile the physical risks from climate change have been discussed for many years, transition risks are a relatively new category\u2026 Transition risks can occur when moving toward a less polluting, greener economy. Such transitions could mean that some sectors of the economy face big shifts in asset values or higher costs of doing business... As companies disclose more information relating to climate change, financial firms will be able to make more informed decisions.\u201d \u2013 The Bank of England KnowledgeBank: \u2018Climate change: what are the risks to financial stability?\u2019 \u00d7 Scientists attribute rising temperatures to the human induced \u2018greenhouse effect.\u2019 Carbon dioxide accounts for most of it. As Display 2 shows, current concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere are already significantly higher than for the past hundreds of thousands of years, and the speed and level of the increase suggest most of it is driven by human activity. \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: IPCC expects global warming of 1.5\u00b0C to be reached in 2040 \uf065 Source: IPCC AR15 Report October 2018 \u2013 Global warming of 1.5\u00b0C \u00d7 DISPLAY 1: IPCC expects global warming of 1.5\u00b0C to be reached in 2040 Source: IPCC AR15 Report October 2018 \u2013 Global warming of 1.5\u00b0C WHY DOES IT MATTER IF THE WORLD \u2018ONLY\u2019 BECOMES 1.5\u00b0C WARMER? Warming will not be evenly spread. The climate will become more unstable and weather patterns disrupted, with heatwaves in some places and hurricanes and floods in others. The list of resulting direct physical climate change risks is long: damage to assets from extreme weather events and rising sea levels, water stress, crop failures and lower yields, lower fish catches, higher mortality and lower labour force productivity in hotter countries, among other effects. But the bigger, longer-term concern is that at a certain point in the warming process, various natural feedback mechanisms will kick in, and warming will self-perpetuate and become unstoppable. These include the albedo effect (as polar ice melts, it reflects less light back into space), release of methane by melting permafrost and the Amazon rainforest dieback among other things. These outcomes are impossible to model exactly, which is why there are a wide range of climate scenarios. \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: CO2 concentration and temperature over 800,000 years \uf065 Source: NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) \u00d7 DISPLAY 2: CO2 concentration and temperature over 800,000 years Source: NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Nonetheless, the damage would be irreversible, and our actions in the next few decades will dictate our planet\u2019s course for centuries to come. \u00d7 GLOBAL WARMING OR CLIMATE CHANGE? \u201cWe often call [it] global warming, but it is causing a set of changes to the Earth\u2019s climate, or long-term weather patterns, that varies from place to place. While many people think of global warming and climate change as synonyms, scientists use \u201cclimate change\u201d when describing the complex shifts now affecting our planet\u2019s weather and climate systems\u2014in part because some areas actually get cooler in the short term.\u201d \u2013 National Geographic?\u2019 \u00d7 \" Natural feedback mechanisms will kick in, and warming will become unstoppable.\u201d TARGETING \u2018NET ZERO\u2019 BY 2050 IS NOW A GLOBAL IMPERATIVE The consensus now is that we have to fully decarbonise\u2014reach \u2018net zero\u2019\u2014by around 2050. Display 3 models the drastic decline in CO2 emissions required with immediate effect in order to reach net zero by both 2055 and 2040. What many people do not realise is that these oft-quoted IPCC emissions reduction targets in most cases assume only a 50-66% probability of limiting global warming to agreed temperature targets. \u00d7 DISPLAY 3: Billion tonnes CO2 per year (GtCO2/yr) \uf065 Source: IPCC AR15 Report October 2018 - Net global CO2 emissions pathway \u00d7 DISPLAY 3: Billion tonnes CO2 per year (GtCO2/yr) Source: IPCC AR15 Report October 2018 - Net global CO2 emissions pathway If the world wants to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change with 100% certainty, it has even less time to decarbonise. To limit global warming to less than 1.5\u00b0C, experts believe we have perhaps less than ten years, as the remaining \u2018carbon budget\u2019 (i.e. future emissions we are \u2018allowed\u2019 to produce before we reach the limit of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere) is much smaller in that scenario (see Display 4). \u00d7 DISPLAY 4: How many years of current emissions would use up the IPCC\u2019s carbon budgets for different levels of warming? \uf065 Source: Carbon Brief data, BofA Global Research Graphic \u00d7 DISPLAY 4: How many years of current emissions would use up the IPCC\u2019s carbon budgets for different levels of warming? Source: Carbon Brief data, BofA Global Research Graphic \" Experts believe we have less than 10 years to limit global warming to less than 1.5\u00b0C\u201d 2. What is the economic impact of climate change? The economic impact of climate change is even harder to predict than its physical impact given the lack of historical precedent. The exact relationship between the economy and the earth\u2019s temperature is still poorly understood and there is currently no consensus among economists. But we do know that the impact of rising temperatures on ecosystems and humans is not linear and various tipping points (see Display 5) cannot be ignored. \u00d7 DISPLAY 5: Direct impacts of climate change can become non-linear when thresholds are crossed (schematic) \uf065 Source: McKinsey Global Institute \u00d7 DISPLAY 5: Direct impacts of climate change can become non-linear when thresholds are crossed (schematic) Source: McKinsey Global Institute A number of academic studies have tried to assess the overall impact of unmitigated climate change on global gross domestic product (GDP). Many of them arrive at a fairly modest global cumulative impact, less than 7% of global output in 2100, relative to a scenario of no climate change. This group of studies has been critiqued for various reasons. Some more pessimistic studies arrive at a much greater impact: a loss of up to 50% of global GDP by 2100 in an \u2018emissions-as-usual\u2019 scenario, relative to no impact of climate change. INCREASED INEQUALITY The potential problem with looking at global GDP is that most of it is currently produced by richer, typically cooler countries. Some of them, for example Canada, may actually benefit in the medium term from global warming. Most of the negative impact, however, is likely to be felt in poorer, hotter countries that contribute less to global GDP. Therefore the nominal impact on global GDP in terms of reduced economic productivity in largely poorer countries may understate the impact on the global population and thus the long-term social impact on the whole world. For example, Display 6 from a 2015 paper from Stanford and Berkeley universities, highlights the disproportionate impact of climate change on the poorest countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. They estimate it could structurally reduce these countries\u2019 growth rate by over 1 percentage point a year. Such increased inequality and divergence, compounded for decades, would mean these countries never get out of the poverty trap. A local climate emergency in poorer countries may create its own negative feedback loop\u2014e.g. increased political instability and conflict, resulting in millions of climate refugees\u2014which could spill over and further affect global sentiment and politics, trade, investment, and thus global economic growth. \u00d7 DISPLAY 6: The impact of climate change on GDP is likely to impact disproportionately the world\u2019s poorest countries \uf065 Source: Global non-linear effect of temperature on economic production (Burke, Hsiang and Miguel, 2015) \u00d7 DISPLAY 6: The impact of climate change on GDP is likely to impact disproportionately the world\u2019s poorest countries Source: Global non-linear effect of temperature on economic production (Burke, Hsiang and Miguel, 2015) In summary, while the degree of economic impact is not clear at this stage, many experts believe that the direction of travel is lower growth and predictability. Given these are major drivers of equity market valuations, investors cannot afford to ignore climate change risk in their portfolios. 3. Emissions in more detail The biggest sector in terms of emissions is power and heat generation, at 42%. Transport is the second largest at around 24%, and industry is third at 19%. This suggests that utilities and transport-related businesses would likely be most impacted by government policy and technological disruption, given they are the two largest contributors to global carbon emissions. We discuss the impact of this further in a later paper. \u00d7 DISPLAY 7: Electricity and heat contribute the highest proportion of global fossil fuel emissions \uf065 Source: IEA, Total CO2 emissions 32.3Gt * Includes emissions from own use in petroleum refining, the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. \u00d7 DISPLAY 7: Electricity and heat contribute the highest proportion of global fossil fuel emissions Source: IEA, Total CO2 emissions 32.3Gt * Includes emissions from own use in petroleum refining, the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. By region, China is now the largest emitter, and has grown emissions substantially since 2000. What China does in terms of carbon policy is thus more important than many perhaps realise. The U.S. and the EU are now in second and third place respectively and their emissions have generally declined in the last decade or so (Display 8). \u00d7 DISPLAY 8: China\u2019s share of global CO2 emissions has grown sharply while the EU28\u2019s has gradually declined \uf065 Source: http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org/en/CO2-emissions \u00d7 DISPLAY 8: China\u2019s share of global CO2 emissions has grown sharply while the EU28\u2019s has gradually declined Source: http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org/en/CO2-emissions WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SCOPES 1, 2 AND 3? Greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting divides all emissions into three scopes: \u00d7 SCOPE 1 are a company\u2019s own direct emissions (e.g. coal/gas power plant, cement kiln, steel furnace, its own trucks). SCOPE 2 are emissions embedded in the organisation\u2019s electricity purchases. They depend on a) how energy intensive the factory/ production is and b) its electricity provider\u2019s energy mix\u2014whether renewables or fossil fuels. This is now a matter of choice in many countries. SCOPE 3 (indirect emissions) relates to the supply chain (upstream) and customers\u2019 logistics and product use emissions (downstream). \u00d7 It is best to think of the three scopes as concentric circles, with Scope 1 in the middle followed by Scopes 2 and 3. \u00d7 \" Around 80% of Scope 1 and 2 emissions in the MSCI World Index are concentrated in just three sectors\u2014utilities, energy and materials.\u201d Scope 1 and 2 emissions are reasonably straightforward to assess and are regularly reported by most companies. Around 80% of Scope 1 and 2 emissions in the MSCI World Index are concentrated in just three sectors\u2014utilities, energy and materials. Scope 3 emissions are harder to quantify. They can be much higher than Scope 1 or 2, but historically, companies have not had much direct control over them. There is little comprehensive data available by company, and double-counting can also be an issue when comparing companies. For e.g. the same CO2 emissions from aluminium produced for a Coca-Cola can would go into the emissions calculation for the aluminium smelter (direct), the can manufacturer, the Coca-Cola bottler and the retailer (all indirect). Whose emissions are they? In the example in Display 9, Scope 3 accounts for 96%+ of Unilever\u2019s emissions, based on their estimates. 63% of total emissions are created by the consumer\u2014 e.g. turning on the kettle or using hot water. These emissions are driven by the energy mix of the consumer\u2019s utility provider, not by Unilever. The company has limited control over its users\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 energy choices. \u00d7 DISPLAY 9: Scope 3 accounts for 96%+ of Unilever\u2019s estimated Greenhouse Gas (GHG) footprint \uf065 Source: Unilever, 1 July 2018-30 June 2019 \u00d7 DISPLAY 9: Scope 3 accounts for 96%+ of Unilever\u2019s estimated Greenhouse Gas (GHG) footprint Source: Unilever, 1 July 2018-30 June 2019 WHY SHOULD BUSINESSES CARE ABOUT MEASURING EMISSIONS ACROSS THE VALUE CHAIN? As we have discussed, measuring Scope 3 emissions is challenging. However, if companies can better understand their full value chain emissions and identify where the risks are, it can help them set meaningful reduction targets, engage with suppliers and other partners, enhance their communications to stakeholders and in turn their corporate reputation. And, of course, in so doing they can play their part in the decarbonisation agenda. We discuss individual company actions further in a later paper. 4. Managing carbon in a portfolio: options for investors In very broad terms, public equity investors concerned about carbon consider two main avenues: I. INVEST IN PURE-PLAY DECARBONISATION COMPANIES OR TRANSITION ENABLERS Investors may choose to invest in companies whose primary activities directly contribute to decarbonisation\u2014 such as the renewable energy sector. This \u2018impact-like\u2019 approach can be difficult to implement widely. Factset\u2019s \u2018Alternative Power Generation\u2019 subset of companies constitutes a mere 0.24% of the MSCI World Index market cap (as at 31 August 2020). It is arguably also a lower quality segment of the market, which could affect long-term performance. According to Bloomberg, in 2019 companies in the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index had an average return on capital of just 3.1% and a negative cash flow yield of -4.6%. Due to the scarcity of such pure play companies another, related approach is to invest in companies that have small but growing exposure to business areas that contribute to energy transition, e.g. \u2018mainstream\u2019 industrials that provide smart grid or renewable energy equipment. While this approach casts a wider net, it is still a niche area. According to FTSE Russell, only 6% of the global equity market (by capitalisation) could be characterised as \u2018green\u2019 in 2017, which includes such transition activities. Similarly, MSCI estimates that only 15% of MSCI All Countries World Index companies have more than 5% of their revenues aligned with the draft EU Sustainable Taxonomy (March 2020). Given their more niche and opportunistic nature, such investments often comprise a \u2018satellite\u2019 allocation within a core-satellite approach, and some investors deploy them as part of their \u2018divest/ invest\u2019 strategy. \u00d7 \u201cThe most meaningful way to measure the greenhouse gas impact of our business is to look across the whole lifecycle of our products. Accurate measurement and transparent reporting of our GHG footprint help us adapt our strategy, set ambitious targets and assess our progress\u2026 Climate change is a principal risk factor for both our business and society at large\u2026 Mitigating climate change starts by reducing our own environmental impact.\u201d \u2013 Unilever \u00d7 II. SEEK TO MINIMISE THE CARBON INTENSITY OF THEIR PORTFOLIOS In contrast, a carbon reduction approach is immediately implementable. There are an increasing array of options, particularly in the passive arena, from exclusions/ divestment through to reweighting/ optimisation and traditional selection. Some investors have chosen to divest from companies owning fossil fuel reserves in order to manage stranded assets risk and make public their concerns about climate change. But others argue that this approach has its shortcomings. As it does not address current carbon emissions across other carbon-heavy sectors that do not own fossil fuel reserves (for example, utilities), it doesn\u2019t result in the lowest carbon footprint. In light of this, we have recently seen a proliferation of indices and ETFs offering low-carbon credentials. Weights in an index are tweaked based on individual companies\u2019 carbon intensity, in order to give investors broad market exposure (and therefore minimal tracking error to a standard benchmark) but with an optimised, reduced carbon footprint. This approach accounts for both current emissions and fossil-fuel reserves. \u00d7 MICROSOFT AND SCOPE 3 REPORTING In January 2020 Microsoft announced its commitment to be carbon negative by 2030. It also changed its carbon targets and internal pricing scheme to include all Scope 3 emissions. It noted that it has a lot of work to do around Scope 3 emissions management. The company is engaging closely with suppliers, and those partners with relatively higher emissions could find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. \u00d7 Index strategies are a route chosen by many investors, but this approach alone can dilute the desired result in terms of carbon impact. For example, in a sample of twenty Global, U.S., EAFE and European low-carbon ETFs (classified by Morningstar), the weighted average Scope 1 and 2 carbon intensity reduction versus the relevant benchmark was 49% (ranging from a 2% to 77% reduction). We think it is possible to do even better. 5. Reducing carbon exposure through a high-conviction, high-quality portfolio As active investors, we naturally believe that investing in an index is not the best way to compound one\u2019s wealth. For those seeking an active strategy, what may not be as obvious is that you do not have to explicitly invest in an environmentally-focused strategy in order to achieve a low carbon footprint. We believe that investing in a concentrated portfolio of predictable, high-return-on-capital compounders, whose value is based on intangible rather than physical assets, is a proven way of significantly reducing one\u2019s carbon exposure without sacrificing long-term performance. A natural by-product of our high-quality approach is that our global strategies have a carbon footprint that is 90-95% lower than MSCI World on a Scope 1 and 2 basis, and around 80% lower on a Scope 1, 2 and 3 basis. In fact, there is a strong inverse correlation between returns on operating capital employed (ROOCE, the metric we focus on when assessing company quality) and carbon intensity. High-quality, high-ROOCE companies are not only steady compounders but also have a structurally lower carbon footprint. Pollution is a capital-intensive exercise. \u00d7 DISPLAY 10: Our high-quality global portfolios show a strong inverse correlation between ROOCE and carbon intensity \uf065 Source: Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Trucost.

WHY IS THIS THE CASE? For the purposes of the carbon theme, most of the high-quality companies we hold can be classified in two ways. THE FIRST GROUP comprises companies that provide purely \u2018intangible\u2019 services\u2014software and IT services, consulting, scientific databases, media content, etc. As they do not sell physical products, by definition their total (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) carbon footprint per unit of revenue is low and is limited to their offices, data centres, and staff travel. THE SECOND GROUP does sell physical products (e.g. consumer or health care products), but is not involved in the carbon-intensive procurement of the raw materials. These companies do operate factories and distribution fleets, but their Scope 1 and 2 emissions per $1mn of sales are still significantly lower than the overall index, as they operate in the high-value-added, low-carbon, middle part of the supply chain. These companies may have significant indirect Scope 3 upstream supply chain emissions (e.g. raw materials and packaging), and therefore our focus is on how companies manage them. Nonetheless, their products typically have no (taking a pill, having a drink, applying skin cream) or relatively low (taking a shower or cooking) product use-related (Scope 3 downstream) emissions, compared with more energy-intensive activities, such as driving a petrol car, or flying. As power generation decarbonises, thanks to the growth in renewables, and households switch to green energy, these emissions are likely to decrease. REDUCED SENSITIVITY TO CARBON PRICING This lower carbon-to-sales footprint is the first reason why compounders\u2019 exposure to carbon risk is significantly lower than average. They also enjoy higher profit margins than most \u2018brown\u2019 companies, which further reduces their profits\u2019 sensitivity to carbon pricing. As illustrated in Display 12, Arcelor Mittal\u2019s profit sensitivity to carbon price is 300 times higher than Alphabet\u2019s and 22.6 times higher than L\u2019Or\u00e9al. \u00d7 DISPLAY 12: Scope 1+2+3 CO2 intensity, tons per $1mn sales \uf065 \u00d7 DISPLAY 12: Scope 1+2+3 CO2 intensity, tons per $1mn sales Estimated total CO2 profit intensity (tonnes per $1million of adjusted EBITA, Scope 1, 2+3) \uf065 Source: Bloomberg, data as of 2018. \u00d7 Estimated total CO2 profit intensity (tonnes per $1million of adjusted EBITA, Scope 1, 2+3) Source: Bloomberg, data as of 2018. Furthermore, because the companies we hold benefit from low price elasticity, significant pricing power and the non-discretionary, recurring nature of their revenues, carbon pricing of total lifecycle emissions is likely to have minimal impact on demand for their products. LOWER RISK OF STRUCTURAL DISRUPTION TRENDS Last, but not least, they are not likely to suffer from decarbonisation-driven technological and policy disruption, unlike the industries in the carbon cross-hairs (e.g. autos, metals, fossil fuels). There is lower pressure to replace their products and services with less-carbon options. In the example above, a shift to electric vehicles will directly impact oil and auto companies, whereas decarbonisation of household energy is unlikely to negatively impact Unilever\u2019s products directly. Instead, it will make their use more environmentally friendly. \u00d7 It is fashionable to talk about the cloud providers\u2019 power-hungry data centres, but despite the remarkable growth of the cloud, major software companies\u2019 Scope 1 and 2 intensity remains very low, and they have also made great strides in powering their data centres with renewable electricity. Alphabet is now one of the largest direct purchasers of renewables. Also, although these companies\u2019 own energy consumption has grown, net net they have reduced energy intensity of computing for everyone, as the cloud offers significant energy savings compared to on premise computing. Covid-19 has further accelerated this trend. \u00d7 Conclusion Policymakers are increasingly focused on the urgency of climate change reform. Ignoring climate risk in portfolios has become a risk in itself, and the transition to a low-carbon economy is likely to mean the relative opportunity set changes. Stakeholders are also playing a greater role in asset owners\u2019 ESG approaches: the 2020 Morgan Stanley Sustainable Signals Survey found that constituent demand is now the most important factor driving the adoption of sustainable investing, followed by the financial return potential. Asset owners are faced with a surfeit of choices to address climate change in a portfolio. We believe that one compelling way to compound shareholders\u2019 wealth in the long term and achieve a low-carbon footprint is by owning high-quality companies with sustainably high returns on operating capital. And in so doing, address stakeholders\u2019 growing concerns about one of the most pressing issues for our planet.

Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy\u2019s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. ESG strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. Stocks of small-capitalisation companies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. \u00d7 Vladimir Demine Head of ESG Research International Equity Team Candida de Sliva Executive Director Featured Funds Global Franchise Portfolio MSFAX | Class I International Equity Portfolio MSIQX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/decarbonisation-the-basics.html"}
{"content": "Effective engagement needs time. Expecting instant results from an engagement is as senseless as expecting instant alpha. Just as we look for steady and consistent growth in the companies we own, we value steady and consistent improvement in their approach to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues over zigzagging in policy to satisfy short-term appetites and box-ticking. \u00d7 As a team, we have engaged with company managements and their boards for over 20 years. In recent years, we have become more structured about our engagements, focusing on dual discussions with the C-suite as well as sustainability representatives of our investee companies. These engagements have provided useful insights, especially regarding company responses to and priorities during the pandemic. We have also become more systematic about the crucial area of management incentives, creating our proprietary Pay X-Ray scoring framework. This has enabled us to better compare and discuss company pay plans and inform our voting approach. In 2020 we voted against management on 30% of say-on-pay resolutions. In the bulk of these cases our stance was in disagreement with ISS, which supported management. Our efforts to engage are helped by our long-term holdings of significant stakes in companies. The resulting access makes us less dependent on news presented at public annual general meetings or investor relations events. We reserve our hardest questions for private meetings, not the podium or the press. We believe the right questions asked in the right way can garner thoughtful consideration of our position and drive the agenda of future engagements. However, we are not afraid to vote against management, as was demonstrated by the 68% of the 2020 shareholder proposals that we supported. Remote working has meant that both asset managers and companies have had to get used to digital and video-conferenced engagement. We found, in the main, that companies were responsive to our requests during lockdown. We held some 369 meetings in 2020, and 205 of those specifically included an ESG engagement on topics ranging from decarbonisation, diversity and data security to supply chain questions from fast fashion to semiconductors. That said, we are looking forward to meeting companies face-to-face again whenever this becomes possible. Discussions with companies in the fourth quarter of 2020 included carbon emissions targets, deforestation, diversity and inclusion, board risk controls and safety. For example: With Reckitt Benckiser, we probed how their recent pledge to be net zero carbon by 2040 can be achieved. We were encouraged by their policies and actions around palm oil. We had a very detailed discussion on deforestation with Procter &amp; Gamble, to understand their initiatives in sustainable paper product sourcing. They have taken a number of concrete actions, but we voted for the shareholder resolution to improve disclosure. Our discussions with Baxter International centred on product safety, given past concerns. They aim to be in the top quartile on safety among global companies and have achieved a good reduction in product complaints through improvement to their inspections. We also examined their diversity and inclusion measures and encouraged them to disclose their gender pay gap. We believe Baxter is making progress and will continue to monitor them. We encourage you to learn more about these and our other engagements through our Engage newsletter, published semi-annually, available at www.morganstanley.com/im. The question of \u201cwhose opinion matters?\u201d has never been more germane. Ultimately, while all stakeholders matter, the top line starts with the customer. Any major concerns relevant to the customer should be high on the agenda of company management. In this context, it is important to be clear about one\u2019s own principles, priorities and values. For our carbon-light, high-quality global portfolios, we pay particular attention to companies\u2019 efforts to meet low or net zero carbon targets. We\u2019re also pragmatists. We recognise that universal problems may require collaborative solutions to hasten progress. MSIM\u2019s support of the One Planet Summit asset manager initiative since January 2020, which aims to advance the understanding of climate-related risks and opportunities in long-term investment portfolios, is an excellent example. In the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment 2020 Annual Report, MSIM scored \u201cA\u201d across modules and \u201cA+\u201d in Listed Equities for both Active Ownership and Incorporation, a result we are delighted with. As companies look to emerge from the crisis, we will continue to ask the hard questions. Many of them are company or industry specific, be it around plastics for consumer staples, product safety for health care or data security for information technology, but there are some more universal themes coming out of the crisis: What are the main lessons from the pandemic? How have companies evolved their attitude to risk as a result of the crisis? Will the company\u2019s supply chain be the same as or different from before the pandemic? Has the company accepted that it is deemed responsible for its supply chain \u2013 from employee health and safety to resourcing? How will capital allocation and balance sheet decisions differ going forward? How have remuneration decisions been affected by the shock of the pandemic? Will the board take into account any capital raising, dividend cuts or take-up of government support? How is the company placed for the new era of greater government intervention? Is there significant exposure to potential new tax regimes? How does the company perceive the impact of remote working on innovation or product safety, or prioritise topics such as gender and racial diversity under tougher economic conditions? How are companies weighing up the balance between the ever-increasing demands for sustainability and their long-term returns on operating capital employed? Globally, the call for greater transparency and disclosure of companies\u2019 and fund managers\u2019 activities, as well as in-depth portfolio reporting, is finding its way into industry bodies and regulation. As we navigate the ESG journey, we believe it pays to avoid faddy \u201ctickboxery\u201d and instead to maintain investment discipline, to focus on robust stocks and on relevant, meaningful long-term engagement. \u00d7 Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective.

{"content": "Bridging Accounting and Valuation \u00d7 This report describes market-expected return on investment (MEROI), which measures the return at which the present value of a company\u2019s profits equals the present value of the investments a company makes. This allows executives and investors to understand how high the bar is set for corporate performance. Measuring returns has become more difficult as corporate investments have shifted from being primarily tangible to intangible. We seek to gain a more accurate view of returns, and hence expectations, by separating expenses and investments properly. We discuss the shortcomings of common measures of corporate returns, including return on equity (ROE), return on invested capital (ROIC), return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC), and internal rate of return (IRR).

Understanding the return on investment helps with understanding a company\u2019s future cash flows, but the challenge is that the mix of investment has shifted over time and is today more intangible than tangible.

{"content": "We show how corporate valuations change as we vary assumptions about growth, return on incremental invested capital, and the discount rate. \u00d7 Most investors value stocks using multiples and also seek to distinguish between value and growth stocks. But these practices obscure the important drivers of value, and very few investors have a clear sense of how revisions in expectations for those drivers change multiples. We focus on how changes in growth rates can affect P/E multiples, the idea that companies with substantial and attractive current investment opportunities lengthen their duration, and why the distinction between growth and value is muddled. It is important to remember that returns on invested capital eventually drift lower due to factors such as competition, maturation, obsolescence, and disruption. Long-duration assets are very sensitive to changes in the discount rate.

{"content": "The deep recession in the first half of this year has led to widespread expectations of significant and persistent disinflation. We estimate that the rates markets are pricing in approximately 1% core inflation on average over the next 10 years. While we agree that some disinflation in the near term is unavoidable, we think that the potential for inflation to accelerate over the next year or so is substantial. We expect core PCE to end 2021 closer to 2%, compared with 1.5% expected by consensus, and is likely to continue to rise further thereafter. Thanks to massive and early fiscal and monetary stimulus measures, incomes are likely to remain resilient in most major economies despite a gigantic fall in output and employment. As lockdowns are relaxed and activity rebounds, we expect resilient aggregate demand, supported by resilient incomes, to be met with a shrunken supply as the labor market recovers more gradually. Economic policy activism, both fiscal and monetary, is likely to endure over the medium term in light of greater social and political acceptance. Deficit spending will necessitate some form of financial repression, with higher inflation likely being a major part of this. \u00d7 Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Cyril Moulle-Berteaux Head of Global Multi-Asset Team Global Multi-Asset Team Sergei Parmenov Managing Director Global Multi-Asset Team", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/stars-aligned-for-higher-inflation.html"}
{"content": "We discuss how we are finding bottom-up stock ideas in China driven by consumption growth and highlight three specific areas where we see vast opportunity: consumer, internet, and healthcare services. \u00d7 China Stock Market Is Misunderstood Our location in Asia, extensive research of companies across Asia and significant allocations to China for more than a decade across the Opportunity Strategies give us a unique perspective on the risks and opportunities of investing in China. In recent years, China\u2019s economic transition, rising debt and political risk have raised concerns in the markets. Indeed, it\u2019s hard to go a single week without a major negative article in the press. While we don\u2019t share a belief in the inevitability of the draconian view, if there are large scale policy missteps, China could become one of the more likely sources of financial contagion due to its sheer size and disproportionate share of worldwide economic growth. We are encouraged that consumption growth has been increasing as a driver of China\u2019s economic expansion. That strikes us as more sustainable. Furthermore, we continue to find compelling bottom-up stock ideas in China, a market that surprisingly makes up 46 percent of the global companies that pass our high quality screen\u2014this is an impressive result (Display 1).1 \u00d7 Display 1: China is under-represented by the equity indices \uf065 Source: Morgan Stanley Investment Management/FactSet, United Nation Population Division, IMF and MSCI.

Data as of January 2020. \u00d7 Display 1: China is under-represented by the equity indices Source: Morgan Stanley Investment Management/FactSet, United Nation Population Division, IMF and MSCI. GDP is on a PPP basis. Data as of January 2020. It means that investors should not ignore China regardless of their macro view. Let\u2019s examine together the transformation we are seeing first-hand in China to present a different side of the story, one where ignoring China can mean a large risk of missing out on what we believe to be some of the greatest bottom-up stock ideas of the next decade. We believe that China is ripe with opportunity for bottom-up stock picking. Whereas historically China\u2019s stock market was primarily comprised of state-owned enterprises (SOE), non-SOEs now represent more than half of the market capitalization of the MSCI China Index at 52 percent in 2020 versus just 5 percent in 2005.2 An increasing number of private companies concentrated in the consumer, healthcare and technology sectors are now accessible to international investors via the Hong Kong Stock Connect program for China A shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen. China Is Under-Represented by Equity Indices China offers vast opportunity to investors willing to extend their time horizon and take a long-term view. Regardless of the consensus view that short-term real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is slowing, China represents nearly 1/5 of the world\u2019s economy an population; yet is under-represented by global equity indices at less than 1/20 (4.5 percent) of the MSCI All Country World Index (Display 1). In the years ahead, we expect that gap to narrow as China\u2019s economy evolves and innovative companies address China\u2019s growing demand for consumption and services, thus necessitating an increase in index weightings for China. Maybe the Chinese economy doesn\u2019t grow at 6 percent anymore and that\u2019s perfectly ok. Let\u2019s assume for the sake of argument that China only grows at 4 percent over the next decade. Isn\u2019t that still better than the zero to 2 percent that most of the developed world has been growing at for the last decade and likely into the future? China\u2019s Net Debt Is Lower Than Advanced Economies Pundits have noted China\u2019s rapid increase in leverage to nearly 300 percent of GDP over the last decade, as well as declining profitability and excess investment capacity. Although unforeseen political developments and trade protectionism also present risks, a key leading indicator to watch going forward, in our view would be any rise in non-performing loans in consumer sectors outside of heavy industries. We believe, however, that the risk of a financial blow-up in the next three years is, although still possible, perhaps overstated at this time by the media. Nearly half of China\u2019s leverage is contained within the financial system and government-owed debt, which is controllable in a command economy. Further, after taking into account the high savings rate in China, the ratio of net debt in China is only 48 percent of GDP, which is far lower than that of Japan, the U.S. and other major economies (Display 2). \u00d7 Display 2: Net debt as percentage of GDP \uf065 Source: Bloomberg.

Consumption Growth Now Drives China\u2019s Economy China\u2019s economy is undergoing a massive transition from fixed asset investment in heavy industry and manufacturing to growth in consumption and services. The contribution to GDP from consumption has averaged 4.6 percent over the past decade (Display 3). China\u2019s consumption growth provides investors with a baseline to expect from the economy going forward: even without the benefit of growth in investment or exports, the world\u2019s second-largest consumer will likely continue to grow faster than the developed world in the years ahead based on consumption growth alone.3 \u00d7 Display 3: Contribution to China GDP growth, 2009-2019 \uf065 Source: Morgan Stanley Research, as of December 2019. \u00d7 Display 3: Contribution to China GDP growth, 2009-2019 Source: Morgan Stanley Research, as of December 2019. A Billion Consumers Want What We Want Over 800 million people have emerged from poverty in China since market reforms were introduced in 1978.4 This emerging middle class wants what those in developed markets have long enjoyed and perhaps take for granted: higher quality consumable products such as food and beverages, internet services to share experiences with family and friends, access to healthcare and better education opportunities for their children. Consumption upgrade demand across food, beverages, household products and personal care continues to outpace that of developed economies. We are attracted to the defensive characteristics of domestic staples categories and specifically of companies with demonstrated competitive advantages sustained through strategies of brand differentiation and cost leadership. Two areas we find particularly compelling are beverages, in which the domestic market appears to be consolidating as leaders capture share in the beer and baijiu spirits markets by leveraging strong brands through superior distribution and execution; and food, where nimble players in niche categories such as soy sauce are delivering stable growth through market consolidation and product premiumization. Over the long-term, household consumption in China is expected to shift from basic necessities to increased discretionary spending as a burgeoning middle class emerges. Internet Chinese internet users now total 854 million, more than 61 percent of the overall population, with 99 percent accessing via mobile,5 yet there remain over 540 million people without access to the internet in China (Display 4). The accompanying changes in consumer behavior benefit domestic social networking, e-commerce, gaming and online travel platforms. The USD 55 billion online advertising market has grown at a 26 percent compound annual growth rate over the last five years.6 Advertising on social networks is growing its share of the pie driven by increased monetization. Meanwhile, e-commerce as a percentage of retail is over 36 percent in China, higher than the U.S., as online leapfrogs offline retail in China which has not developed modern offline retail at scale.7 We believe that continued growth in engagement of the China internet population which now spends over six hours per day on digital media,8 will continue to benefit businesses that leverage the internet as a distribution platform. \u00d7 Display 4: Internet penetration in China, 2003-2019 \uf065 Source: China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), eMarketer.

High Quality Stocks in China After three decades of rapid real GDP growth driven by fixed asset investment in heavy industry, China is adjusting to a more moderate pace driven by consumption and services. Rebalancing the world\u2019s second-largest economy is not without its well-known challenges, but as bottom-up investors we look through the short-term macro noise and have been finding plenty of high quality stocks in China. Therefore, we believe that if you want to find some of the best bottom-up stock ideas of the next decade, then look to China because as Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett\u2019s long-time partner said about China, \u201cIt\u2019s a happier hunting ground.\u201d9 \u00d7 Display 6: High quality screen: Percentage of non-financial companies with both 15% sales growth and return on invested capital (ROIC) \uf065 Source: Morgan Stanley Investment Management/FactSet.

RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in these portfolios. Please be aware that these portfolios may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact these portfolios to a greater extent than if these portfolios\u2019 assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general, equity securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds (ETFs), the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Asia market entails liquidity risk due to the small markets and low trading volume in many countries. In addition, companies in the region tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. Furthermore, because the strategy concentrates in a single region of the world, performance may be more volatile than a global strategy. Privately placed and restricted securities may be subject to resale restrictions as well as a lack of publicly available information, which will increase their illiquidity and could adversely affect the ability to value and sell them (liquidity risk). Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. To the extent that the Fund invests in a limited number of issuers (focused investing), the Fund will be more susceptible to negative events affecting those issuers and a decline in the value of a particular instrument may cause the Fund\u2019s overall value to decline to a greater degree than if the Fund were invested more widely. China Risk. Investments in China involve risk of a total loss due to government action or inaction. Additionally, the Chinese economy is export-driven and highly reliant on trade. Adverse changes to the economic conditions of its primary trading partners, such as the United States, Japan and South Korea, would adversely impact the Chinese economy and the Fund\u2019s investments. Moreover, a slowdown in other significant economies of the world, such as the United States, the European Union and certain Asian countries, may adversely affect economic growth in China. An economic downturn in China would adversely impact the Portfolio\u2019s investments. Risks of Investing through Stock Connect. Any investments in A-shares listed and traded through Stock Connect, or on such other stock exchanges in China which participate in Stock Connect is subject to a number of restrictions that may affect the Portfolio\u2019s investments and returns. Moreover, Stock Connect A shares generally may not be sold, purchased or otherwise transferred other than through Stock Connect in accordance with applicable rules. The Stock Connect program may be subject to further interpretation and guidance. There can be no assurance as to the program\u2019s continued existence or whether future developments regarding the program may restrict or adversely affect the Portfolio\u2019s investments or returns. ESG Strategies that incorporate impact investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. As a result, there is no assurance ESG strategies could result in more favorable investment performance. \u00d7 Kristian Heugh Managing Director Counterpoint Global Marc Fox Managing Director, Global Opportunity Team Featured Funds Global Opportunity Portfolio MGGIX | Class I Asia Opportunity Portfolio MSAQX | Class I International Opportunity Portfolio MIOIX | Class I Developing Opportunity Portfolio MDOEX | Class I Previous Next", "url": "https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/fishing-for-stocks-in-china.html"}

More formally,1 it is Information Ratio = Information Coefficient \u2217 \u221a\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61\u210e Information ratio (IR) measures the return of a portfolio adjusted for risk by dividing the portfolio\u2019s excess return versus a benchmark by the tracking error. Information coefficient (IC) is the average correlation between forecasts and outcomes. And breadth (BR) is the number of independent opportunities for investments that offer excess returns over a period. Breadth tends to be related to the dispersion of asset returns. Two essential themes for investors come out of a discussion of skill and opportunity sets. First, it is crucial to think about your source of edge and to align your organization\u2019s process to serve that end. Second, a big part of winning is finding a game that allows you to show your skill. Investors can express skill in three ways: market timing, security selection and position sizing. It\u2019s not how often you are right that matters; it\u2019s how much money you make when you\u2019re right versus how much money you lose when you\u2019re wrong. But all the skill in the world is useless if there is no opportunity. There are a few ways this can happen. First, a skillful participant does not get to play the game, a result of capital or other constraints. Second, the cost to play may be too high due to arbitrage costs. Finally, skill is obscured if the opportunity does not offer differentiated payoffs. To quantify opportunity, we look at dispersion. Dispersion measures the range of returns for a group of stocks. Generating a return in excess of the benchmark is really hard if the gains or losses in the underlying stocks are all very similar to those of the benchmark. On the other hand, there is a bountiful opportunity to pick the winners, avoid the losers and create a portfolio that meaningfully beats the benchmark if the dispersion of the constituent stocks is high. Research shows that dispersion is a reasonable proxy for breadth and that the results for skillful mutual fund managers are better when dispersion is high. Display 1 shows the relationship between breadth and the gap between winners and losers. The data reveal that it is very difficult for a manager to distinguish him or herself in an asset class with low breadth and that the gap between winners and losers is much more pronounced in asset classes with high breadth. \u00d7 Display 1: Higher Dispersion Allows for Enhanced Expression of Skill Across Asset Classes \uf065 Source: Joop Huij and Simon Lansdorp, \u201cMutual Fund Performance Persistence, Market Efficiency, and Breadth,\u201d Working Paper, October 25, 2012.

Note: The chart is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Looking at the relationship between annual dispersion and standard deviation of alpha, a measure of the width of the distribution of alpha, shows the same clear relationship. More dispersion tends to spell more opportunity. Talented managers need dispersion in order to ply their skill. No matter how you seek to generate excess returns\u2014whether through batting averages or slugging ratios\u2014it is vital that you have a roadmap to those returns and that your process is congruent with that objective. But there must also be a chance to express skill. Even the most talented will not fare well if they have no occasion to do so. Dispersion is one way to measure this opportunity set, and there is solid research behind the idea that high dispersion presents the opportunity for skilled managers to generate excess returns. \u00d7 Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } 1 Richard C.

{"content": "How to Reduce the Sources of Forecasting Error \u00d7 Anticipating revisions in market expectations is the key to generating long-term excess returns as an investor. Successful long-term investors see where expectations are headed based on their forecasts, but research shows that most experts do not make great forecasts. Barbara Mellers, a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, says, \u201cWe find prediction really hard, but we find explanation fairly easy.\u201d1 We tell stories to ourselves and others to paper over our poor predictions. But the news is not all gloomy. The U.S. intelligence community sponsored a forecasting tournament, which revealed that one-in-fifty \u201csuperforecasters\u201d consistently made better predictions than did the other participants. Part of the success of the superforecasters reflected their qualities, including numeracy, intellectual curiosity, probabilistic thinking, and open-mindedness. But part of their success relied on habits that can be \u201clearned and cultivated by any intelligent, thoughtful, determined person.\u201d2 Statisticians and psychologists examined the gap between \u201csuperforecasters\u201d and regular forecasters using the \u201cBIN Model,\u201d where \u201cB\u201d refers to bias, \u201cI\u201d to information and \u201cN\u201d to noise. When the researchers tallied why the superforecasters were so much better than the regular forecasters, they found the difference was roughly 50 percent from reducing noise, 25 percent from reducing bias and 25 percent from increasing information. It\u2019s important to recognize that because noise and bias are independent sources of error, reducing either one of them improves forecasts. \u00d7 Display 1: Bias and Noise \uf065 Source: Counterpoint Global. \u00d7 Display 1: Bias and Noise Source: Counterpoint Global. When the researchers examined the impact of training on overall accuracy, they also found that the training improved accuracy more by reducing noise than by tamping down bias. Noise. The three primary ways to reduce noise are combining judgments, using algorithms, and adopting the \u201cMediating Assessments Protocol\u201d (MAP). Combining forecasts is the core idea behind the wisdom of crowds, with the market a good example of a mechanism that aggregates views. Forecasting accuracy is compromised when there is no effective way to aggregate the information, or if the errors become correlated and noise transitions to collective bias. Algorithms are simply sets of rules or procedures that allow you to achieve a goal. For example, a cake recipe is an algorithm. Research has found that one way to increase the acceptance of algorithms is to allow humans to adjust the final answer just a bit, what Daniel Kahneman calls \u201cdisciplined intuition.\u201d Finally, the Mediating Assessments Protocol (MAP) is a way to create intermediate ratings based on what\u2019s critical in order to come to a final decision that is more informed than relying solely on intuition. Bias. Debiasing methods introduce base rates to ground forecasts, premortems and red teams to open minds to alternative outcomes, and signposts to create a way to learn from mistakes. The methods produce spillover effects that help manage noise as well. Information. Using information effectively means getting an informational advantage when you can, updating your view accurately and promptly to reflect new information, and placing the proper weight on the information at your disposal. Analysis of the forecasters in the tournament revealed that the frequency of belief updating was \u201cthe strongest single behavioral predictor of accuracy.\u201d Investors can use the BIN model to assess their decision-making process, with a heightened awareness of the large and potentially overlooked role of noise. Because noise tends to be overlooked or ignored, improving consistency can add a great deal of value, and identifying companies that adopt practices to reduce noise may be the source of excess returns. \u00d7 Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Counterpoint Global consists of 54 people, including 30 investors, four disruptive change researchers, two consilient researchers and two sustainability researchers.

{"content": "As the price of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have fluctuated wildly over the last year, bitcoin, and blockchain, the underlying technology that powers it, have captured the popular imagination. Blockchain at its heart is a distributed-ledger technology that employs cryptography to ensure the integrity of the data it stores. For all its hype, blockchain is basically just a novel approach to database architecture where control of the data is distributed among all the parties using it. This architecture is enabled by cryptography and the use of tokens (i.e., cryptocurrencies) as incentives for participants to perform the work to ensure the data\u2019s integrity. What makes blockchain so disruptive is its shared ledger eliminates the need for intermediaries to establish trust and authenticate identity between two untrusted parties who want to transact. As a result, blockchain has the potential to cut out the financial middleman. In particular, cryptocurrencies are gaining traction as a form of payment for e-commerce transactions where there is a high risk of fraud and/or chargebacks. While blockchain technology can be adopted by existing financial institutions to facilitate transactions, it has the potential to enable a new set of payment rails that circumvents the existing financial establishment. It is still unclear if bitcoin will become a lasting piece of the financial firmament or is just a passing fad. While it has the potential to become as ubiquitous as the internet over time, there are nevertheless many issues to be addressed. As with the internet, we will probably see a mixture of both blockchain native companies as well as companies adopting the technology to improve their existing business processes and to attack new market opportunities afforded by these new capabilities. We believe blockchain is a technology that will continue to garner increasing mindshare in the years ahead. \u00d7 Download PDF .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.center{ margin:0 auto 0 auto; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn.right{ float:right; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn{ display: block; width:50%; box-shadow:none !important; background-color:#0062AC; border-color:#adadad; color:#ffffff; font-size:16px; font-family:karlaregular; border-radius:6px; } .buttoncomponent.custom-btn:hover{ background-color:#ffffff; border-color:#0062AC; color:#0062AC; } Counterpoint Global consists of 54 people, including 30 investors, four disruptive change researchers, two consilient researchers and two sustainability researchers.
