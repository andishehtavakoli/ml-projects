The most common question I get these days is whether I am worried about the impact of de-globalization. The risks are clear: rising U.S.-China tensions, the war in Ukraine, increasing trade barriers, broken supply chains, a painful bear market and a slowing global economy.
Given the turbulence, aren’t multinational companies the most vulnerable of all?
I believe the opposite is true. Simply put, multinationals are in many ways best positioned to navigate an uncertain environment and develop effective solutions to disruptions. That includes an increasingly “multi-local” approach to business, putting them closer to consumers around the world.
Here are four reasons I remain optimistic that multinationals can thrive in tough times:
1. Multinationals can adapt to U.S.-China tensions
When I first discussed this subject a few years ago, the U.S.-China trade war was just beginning to command headlines. Since then, we’ve seen many twists and turns.
The two biggest economies in the world have hit each other with onerous tariffs and other trade restrictions. China has initiated more trade with Russia, despite international sanctions imposed by the U.S. and European Union following the invasion of Ukraine last year. And just a few weeks ago, the U.S. military shot down what it believed to be a spy balloon sent by China to get a glimpse of U.S. defense installations — further stressing U.S.-China relations.
Beyond those immediate issues, we still have a long way to go before the U.S. and China can resolve more entrenched disputes over intellectual property theft and heavy subsidies for China’s state-owned enterprises. Those prickly issues may take years or even decades to resolve — if they get resolved at all.
In the meantime, companies that conduct business all over the world are doing what they do best: finding ways to adapt and succeed regardless of growing headwinds.
For example, in the computer chip industry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and chip equipment maker ASML are both expanding their operations around the world. TSMC is, rather remarkably, building new manufacturing plants in Arizona and Japan, while Netherlands-based ASML is more quietly investing to bolster its operations in Germany, Connecticut and California. As new facilities are built, Caterpillar, the world’s largest manufacturer of construction equipment, could see increased demand for its heavy duty products.
These are examples of the types of companies I like to call “global champions.” As a group, they often do well in almost any environment. They can certainly weather tough times, but then they can also reposition themselves to succeed when things begin to turn around.
Multinational companies have outpaced the market

2. Experienced management teams can handle challenges
What’s the rationale for my high level of confidence? There is a reason multinational companies have come to dominate the global economy and financial markets. For the most part, they are run by managers who are smart, tough and experienced. This isn’t their first rodeo. They have seen all types of trade environments, favorable and unfavorable. In my view, these battle-tested companies are favorably positioned to survive and even thrive in a hostile landscape.
Nestlé provides a good example of how a multinational can tap into high-tech solutions to streamline its supply chain operations. In recent years, the food giant has increasingly used the blockchain — best known as the foundation of bitcoin-related technology — to enable faster, transparent and more cost-effective delivery of products. The publicly available blockchain data not only allows the company to track its supply chain sourcing in a more efficient way, it also shares the exact origin of the products customers are looking to purchase. If you want to know where those coffee beans are from, just scan a barcode and you’ll have the answer.
For investors, it’s important to avoid focusing too much on the noise surrounding trade, protectionism and geopolitical conflict. It’s easy to get lost in the political rhetoric over steel or semiconductors or whatever product is targeted next. There are conflicting data points released nearly every day, and many of them are inconsequential. To the extent that these types of conflicts cause investors to shy away from multinational companies, paying too much attention to the rhetoric is detrimental to successful long-term investing.
Global companies scour the world for customers

3. Reshoring supply chains is likely to benefit some companies
Many global companies are establishing successful operations in local markets, rather than retreating in the face of trade barriers. More and more it is becoming crucial for multinationals to produce where they sell. To succeed, they must be able to move swiftly and respond efficiently to local competition.
Most important, many global companies are moving away from single-source supply chains. Reliability and robustness are of greater importance than cost and efficiency. That means bringing some manufacturing back home, or “reshoring,” and moving some to other countries, such as India, Vietnam and Mexico.
Sports apparel giant Nike optimizes this approach with its hyper-local sales initiatives. For instance, Nike has launched data-driven retail stores that stock shoes according to online buying trends in surrounding ZIP codes. It doesn’t get much more local than that. In Europe, Nike has established a speedy supply chain initiative that allows it to tailor colors and materials based on individual customer preferences in each city it operates.
Visa and Mastercard are following much the same approach when it comes to electronic payment processing, which must be tailored not just to the preferences of local customers but to the strict financial regulations of governments around the world. As a result, both have grown at a healthy pace while evolving and adapting to a changing set of competitors in the fintech industry.
The companies that successfully navigated the COVID crisis were able to quickly expand their online offerings, localize their supply sourcing, produce closer to where they sell and tap into multiple suppliers all over the world. This unpredictable environment played to the strength of multinational companies with the expertise, the resources and the money to adapt at a moment’s notice.
A new breed of multinational companies has arrived

4. Global champions thrive in emerging markets
In many ways, a multi-local strategy is crucial for companies based in the U.S., Europe and Japan that are looking to stay relevant or expand into faster growing emerging markets. Many of those countries — China, India, Brazil, etc. — are nurturing their own multinational giants, as well as smaller, single-country-focused competitors and not waiting for the traditional global players to catch up.
For example, Mercado Libre — often referred to as “the Amazon.com of Latin America” — has done a remarkable job of defending its territory from the exact company it is so often compared to. One of Mercado Libre’s chief advantages is a more aggressive use of third-party sellers, many of which are based in Latin America, giving local customers greater access to locally sourced goods though a fast, efficient online platform.
A significant risk for some large multinationals is that they could be “leapfrogged” by smaller competitors who are more in touch with local markets. In my view, that dynamic is a bigger threat than any geopolitical or trade-related issue.
Emerging markets consumers are looking for brands they can trust and companies that know the local marketplace. Large multinationals that can break themselves down, think locally, act nimbly and launch products quickly are more likely to succeed in the long run.
In the meantime, this shifting global landscape is good news for stock pickers with a penchant for fundamental research. Not every company will get it right, and it’s our job to separate the ones that can from those that cannot.
If you are willing to embrace short-term discomfort for long-term benefit, it’s a great time to be an active investor.

1,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/3-views-future-growth-investing.html,3 views on the future of growth investing,U.S. Equities,"February 23, 2023","Growth stocks took a beating in 2022, no question about that. The crucial question for growth-oriented investors today is: Where do we go from here?
“Last year investors recognized that historically low interest rates produced many excesses, including high-flying stocks without the earnings to support them,” says Carl Kawaja, an equity portfolio manager for EuroPacific Growth Fund®. “That said, the fundamental tenet of buying companies whose return is going to come from generating superior growth over time still makes sense for long-term investors. You just need to be more selective today.”
Indeed, many well-known growth companies have been repriced to account for a more expensive cost of capital. Going forward, proven earnings growth will likely be a bigger driver of returns, Kawaja says. The good news is that companies with growth potential will probably come from a broader range of industries and regions — not just U.S. tech and consumer stocks.
Markets are moving from narrow to broader leadership
Sources: Capital Group, Refinitiv Datastream, Standard & Poor’s. As of 12/31/22. Indexed to 100 as of 1/1/05.
“We're moving from what had been a very binary world — you invested in one sector and avoided others, you invested in the U.S. and avoided non-U.S. — to a more balanced environment with a broader sense of opportunity,” explains Martin Romo, an equity portfolio manager for The Growth Fund of America®.
In the 50 years since The Growth Fund of America began operations — and nearly 40 for EuroPacific Growth Fund — we have witnessed the era of the Nifty Fifty of the 1970s, the tech bubble of the 1990s, the global financial crisis of 2007–2009, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These funds and their generations of portfolio managers have navigated them all.
Here, three of Capital Group’s current generation of growth investors — Romo, Kawaja and Cheryl Frank, an equity portfolio manager for AMCAP Fund® — share their views on how growth investing is evolving, where they are looking for opportunity and how they are preparing for the next bull market.
1. The AI inflection point is here
Martin Romo, 31 years of investment experience
Tech and consumer stocks have been punished, and in many cases that was warranted. But in some cases, I think the market is throwing out the baby with the bathwater. When nearly everyone says that the world has changed and what was true over the last 10 years can’t be true going forward — I think that is a mistake. The market may be overlooking continued strength in some well-positioned companies.
What’s more, the pace of innovation around the world is picking up. Several colleagues and I recently spent a few weeks in Silicon Valley meeting with public companies and venture capital firms, and I came away believing we are at an inflection point with artificial intelligence (AI). Innovative uses of AI are happening all around.
The speed of adoption for new technologies is picking up
Source: Statista. As of 12/31/22. Kickstarter refers to number of backers. Airbnb refers to number of nights booked. Foursquare and Instagram refer to number of downloads.
Companies like Microsoft are using AI technology to help differentiate their offerings and deliver enhanced productivity to customers. Microsoft has already issued a limited test release of its Bing search engine that harnesses ChatGPT, a chatbot developed in partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft has also disclosed plans to include the technology in its widely used Office software suite, its Teams platform and its GitHub code-development service.
Wider adoption of AI technology will require massive computing power, providing tailwinds for cloud services and the semiconductor industry. Nvidia, which develops semiconductors and computing hardware, already uses AI to improve the speed of its own product development and recently disclosed an AI distribution partnership with Microsoft. Semiconductor maker Broadcom, which helped develop AI chips for Google in 2016, has since introduced more advanced AI chips.
The key takeaway for me is that we are very early in the development of this technology. It feels like the early days of mobile and cloud as they entered an era of hyper-charged growth. Right now, there’s a lot of hype surrounding AI and questions about the accuracy of chatbots. Despite a challenging environment, I remain very excited about the long-term investment opportunities on the horizon.
Go deeper:
2. “Picks and shovels” enable growth across industries
Cheryl Frank, 24 years of investment experience
One lesson I’ve learned in my career is to closely track capital floods and droughts. When capital floods into a sector, it usually drives increased investment that can lead to opportunities for suppliers in that industry. These are what I call pick-and-shovel companies. Investors sometimes overlook these businesses, but they often have more stable cash flows and lower risk profiles compared to the companies they service.
Consider how much money has flowed into health care research and development (R&D). This has been going on for a few years, but it was turbocharged during the pandemic. Pharmaceutical companies that successfully developed COVID vaccines and anti-viral treatments, such as Pfizer and Moderna, piled up cash. Much of this capital will be funneled into more R&D.
Pick-and-shovel companies like Danaher and Thermo Fisher Scientific, which provide drugmakers with testing equipment, reagents and diagnostics, could see demand for their services rise as R&D investment grows.
By contrast, in the energy sector we saw a years-long capital drought as energy prices touched levels near zero. Then, as soon as supplies got tight and prices rose, capital flooded back in. Record-breaking cash flow over the last 12 months has left oil producers with some of the strongest balance sheets in history.
Even though energy is not a growth sector, I believe there are opportunities for growth within it. When energy companies profit, they typically expand exploration and production, which requires more machinery and services. This could be a source of growth for companies that provide technology, products and services to the industry.
Tech and consumer sectors aren’t the only sources of growth potential
Sources: Capital Group, MSCI, Refinitiv Datastream. In 2018, the telecommunications sector was expanded and reclassifed by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) as communication services. As a result of the reclassification, Facebook, Netflix and Alphabet became included in communication services sector. Prior to 2018, Facebook and Alphabet had been classified as information technology constituents, and Netflix had been classified within the consumer discretionary sector. Values through 2023 are current as of January 31, 2023.
3. Global champions get stronger as the dollar weakens
Carl Kawaja, 36 years of investment experience
Last year, for the first time in almost a decade, U.S. stocks trailed markets in other major regions of the world. The odds that this trend can continue are reasonably good, in my view, simply because we've been in a long upcycle for U.S. stocks and the U.S. dollar.
For companies outside the U.S., dollar strength tends to be a headwind. At some point, I believe the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates. And when that happens, I think we may see further dollar weakness. So I'm optimistic about the prospects for international investing.
Regardless of whether economies in Europe or Asia do well, there will be great companies in those regions with solid business prospects. I often use a basketball analogy to help describe this dynamic. I'm struck by how international the NBA has become. In a sport that was first championed in the U.S., the NBA now features something like 120 international players from 40 countries, including some of the biggest superstars in the game.
Today I think there are select companies outside the U.S. that have been waking up to their opportunity globally. They are refocusing on generating value for shareholders during a time that is much more beneficial for their currency. In other words, like basketball, the world catches up, and some of the superstar companies are based in other countries.
Consider ASML, the world’s leading provider of manufacturing equipment for the most advanced semiconductors. It just happens to be based in the Netherlands. ASML has developed unique technology for making advanced chips. As its market share grew, it aggressively invested in developing its technological advantage. Right now, many chip stocks are down and the industry is struggling with oversupply. But taking a multi-year view, I think the industry is well positioned for a strong cyclical recovery.
Another example is in drug discovery. We are in the middle of a golden age of health care innovation. Many of the recent advances in treatments for cancer and pathogens like the COVID virus have been developed by U.S. companies. But there is also a Danish pharmaceutical company, Novo Nordisk, that has developed therapies to treat diabetes and obesity. Again, interest in this company has less to do with whether European markets can outpace U.S. markets and more to do with a worldwide increase in diabetes and obesity and the potential to improve patients’ lives.
Why experience matters during volatile markets
All three of these seasoned investors believe the keys to navigating volatile markets are patience, experience and a long-term perspective. “There are lots of questions today about inflation, the Fed and recession,” Romo says, “But if we look over the horizon and focus on durable investment themes over the next few years, then I see lots of opportunity ahead.
“Growth investing is down but not out. Seeking to invest in companies with superior long-term prospects is as relevant today as ever.” Such companies are more likely to survive market downturns and come out stronger on the other side.
That sentiment was nicely echoed years ago by former Capital Group Chairman Jim Rothenberg, who was a member of an earlier generation of portfolio managers on The Growth Fund of America from 1994 to 2014.
When asked for his market prediction, Rothenberg said, “I don’t predict the rain. I help investors build financial arks.”

2,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/five-energy-trends.html,5 trends driving energy markets in 2023,Energy,"February 15, 2023","Is there more fuel in the tank for energy stocks?
That’s the question on many investors’ minds as the energy sector solidly outpaced all others over the past two years. Historically, the trajectory of oil prices has been a good gauge of prospects for the sector, as the price directly impacts many companies’ bottom lines. But thus far in 2023, there appear to be some deviations from this tried-and-true correlation. In fact, oil prices took a tumultuous ride last year, recently returning to near where they started in 2022. In contrast, energy stocks continue to mostly hold onto their gains.
1.  Will the bull run for oil equities continue?
We believe we’re in the early stages of a multiyear bull run for oil stocks. That does not mean the energy sector — led by oil stocks — will move in a straight line. Amid long uptrends, there are also mini-cycles, some lasting months to a year or more, in which short-term factors outweigh longer term supply-demand trends. Nevertheless, we see investment opportunities over the next three to five years.
China’s reopening and lifting of COVID-19 restrictions is likely to push oil demand to new highs, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasting an increase of nearly 2 million barrels per day. Meanwhile, there is a structural supply shortage due to many years of underinvestment in new capacity by oil companies, production cuts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+) with output undershooting supply targets, and declining U.S. shale inventories. It will take a number of years before we see supply catch up with demand. Together these factors should be supportive of oil prices above $70 per barrel.
Analysis of prior energy equity bull markets (we show Canada, as an example, in the chart below) suggests we may still be in the early innings of a positive rerating for the sector. Supported by higher energy prices, companies in the sector generated a record-breaking estimated $1.4 trillion of free cash flow (FCF) in 2022. Valuations remain attractive across a number of metrics including price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. And the resilience of oil stocks in the face of falling oil prices over the last three months suggests investors are looking past any near-term weakness in the underlying commodity price.
Energy equity bull markets have often shown staying power

2.  What are top spending priorities for oil companies?
The industry business model has largely pivoted from a focus on high growth and reinvestment in production to a focus on higher dividend payouts and more capital discipline. This has been one of the most pronounced changes we’ve seen in our lifetime. And this trend looks set to continue. Record-breaking cash flow over the last 12 months has left oil producers with some of the strongest balance sheets in history. Nearly 40% of executives from the top 100 oil and gas companies in the U.S. indicated debt reduction and shareholder returns as their top capital allocation priorities, according to a 2022 study by Deloitte.
The shortening and steepening of the cost curve is benefiting oil producers
Sources: Capital Group, Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs. Data as of April 2022.
The cost curve indicates how much oil would be produced for a given price — a function of determining profitability for producers above the breakeven cost of drilling a new oil well. Short and steep cost curves generally enable producers to generate higher profits. Kboe/d = thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day
This renewed focus on shareholder returns has emerged because investors are demanding capital discipline. Investors who are willing to engage now are pressing for dividends and share buybacks rather than reinvestment at higher prices. It is likely going to be another 12 to 18 months before we see producers start to reinvest in their businesses while still maintaining a sharp focus on capital discipline and return on investment.
Supply-demand dynamics also support a higher oil price. It will take years for supply to catch up with demand as illustrated by widening OPEC+ production deficits and forecasted dwindling global spare capacity. Of the major oil-producing countries, Saudi Arabia could increase capacity by a million barrels per day and the United Arab Emirates by another million. But it would take years to build out that capacity, and U.S. production is slowing quite quickly. Taken together, there’s just not enough oil to bolster global supply.
Moreover, exploration costs are going up. Higher quality oil reserves have been used up, and further exploration is getting more expensive and requires greater expertise as drilling goes further afield. U.S. exploration and production companies lack the expertise for advanced exploration and will likely have to acquire companies that know how to tap into these oil fields to bring new supply to market. Additionally, oil services costs have risen with inflation. The higher cost structure is impacting the entire industry but will most acutely affect smaller companies with fewer resourcing options. 
Taking demand and supply dynamics into consideration, in our view, $70 per barrel of oil is a floor that should hold under most scenarios, and our analysis shows this would allow the major oil companies to maintain profitability, even when factoring in inflation and higher costs of production. 
3.  What is the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on energy companies?
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is a landmark piece of legislation. The bill directs $369 billion in federal funding to clean energy tax incentives, loans, and consumer and commercial subsidies that have the potential to make the return profile more compelling for investments in areas such as carbon sequestration and the build-out of clean hydrogen infrastructure.
Over the next decade, the legislation could help to unleash a wave of capital expenditure. Oil and gas companies alongside chemicals and auto manufacturers are just a few potential beneficiaries. Only a handful of the U.S. supermajors have scalable low-carbon projects underway, but the subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act are likely to move others off the sidelines.
Amid the optimism, it’s fair to say that some firms are proceeding cautiously, mindful that policy priorities could adjust with changes in the balance of political power. The Biden administration is supportive of investment in renewables; however, if there is a change in administration in the next election or if energy prices become too high, priorities could easily shift back in favor of fossil fuels to help lower costs.
4.  How do European and U.S. companies differ in their approaches to decarbonization?
Oil and gas companies, regardless of region, are seeking new ways to reduce emissions in their operations. One of the key drivers of this change in behavior has been the proliferation of net-zero targets, where the amount of human-produced greenhouse gas emissions is balanced by an equal reduction.
European oil and gas companies are proactively seeking replacements for their fossil fuel businesses, while U.S. companies are primarily focused on how to remove carbon from their existing businesses. They are leveraging tactics such as carbon sequestration — in which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and held in solid or liquid form — rather than looking to diversify their energy mix. 
European supermajors are investing more capital into low-carbon investments
Source: InfluenceMap. Data as of September 2022.
Capital expenditure figures are taken from information disclosed directly by the company. It is noted that investments dedicated to transitioning away from fossil fuels are likely lower, as several companies include fossil gas-related activities in their “low-carbon” capex. 
Like their U.S. counterparts, European firms are incentivized by new legislation. The REPowerEU plan, adopted by the European Commission in March 2022, directs nearly €210 billion in new investments toward clean energy in the European Union. The bill finances new energy partnerships with renewable and low-carbon gas suppliers, as well as clean hydrogen projects and solar and wind build-outs.
Failure to invest now in renewable infrastructure results in the risk of companies being disrupted later on. And it’s not just a matter of environmental, social and governance concerns. There’s a risk of market share loss as overall demand for renewables increases.
5.  Where do you see areas of relative value?
There’s a fairly widespread view that production costs in the Canadian oil sands, located in the Alberta region, are high. But the facts on the ground are changing. The cost of oil production there has declined over the last two decades. The long-life, low-decline nature of these assets means the capital intensity required to maintain operations is comparatively low versus U.S. peers, and it enables high free cash flow generation, which is cash flow in excess of the company’s operating and capital expenses. In addition, the Canadian oil sands stocks often trade at valuation discounts to the U.S. exploration and production peer group, and that is due in part to environmental concerns and the high carbon intensity of production per barrel.
Lower capital intensity for the Canadian oil sands supports high free cash flow conversion
Sources: Company filings and Capital Group analysis. Free cash flow conversion is a ratio that indicates how much cash is available to a company after covering its operating and capital expenses, an indication of its capital intensity. Defined here as free cash flow divided by cash flow from operations.
Companies highlighted: Canadian oils sands (IMO = Imperial Oil; CNQ = Canadian Natural Resources Limited; CVE = Cenovus Energy; SU = Suncor Energy).

The management teams of select U.S. and European oil giants are operating with the strongest capital discipline seen in decades, and dividends offer some cushion for investors even if oil prices soften from here. The supermajors may benefit from higher-for-longer oil and gas prices supporting upstream exploration and production companies — in addition to record high downstream refining margins that purely upstream companies do not have exposure to. On a valuation basis, the European supermajors trade at a wider-than-usual discount versus their U.S. peers on price-to-earnings multiples, despite very similar business characteristics.

4,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/3-reasons-60-40-portfolios-comeback.html,3 reasons why 60/40 portfolios may make a comeback,Asset Allocation,"February 2, 2023","The death of the 60/40 portfolio has been greatly exaggerated.
Ask your search engine, “Is the 60/40 portfolio dead?” and it will generate about half a million results, many of them published recently. Following a difficult year for both stocks and bonds, the increased interest is understandable.
The 60/40 portfolio — shorthand for a diversified portfolio built with 60% equities and 40% fixed income — is intended to generate solid returns while minimizing risk. This did not happen in 2022, as stocks and bonds declined in tandem.
Investors expressed their disappointment with their dollars, withdrawing $43.6 billion from strategies in Morningstar’s “Allocation — 50% to 70% Equity” category in 2022. That followed a period when investors withdrew billions from such strategies in six of seven years for different reasons, including when stock markets were soaring.
“We saw a lot of folks exit balanced strategies in 2022,” says Hilda Applbaum, an equity portfolio manager for American Balanced Fund®. “While there is a lot of wisdom in markets, there also is a herd mentality. I believe many investors have become disbelievers in balanced strategies at the wrong time. I am confident that, going forward, balanced portfolios — whether they are a 60/40 split or 65/35 — may continue to be a successful approach for most investors over the long term.”

Data as of 12/31/2022.
Below, Applbaum, who invests in both stocks and bonds, and David Hoag, a fixed income portfolio manager with The Bond Fund of America®, share three reasons they believe conditions today are more favorable for balanced investing, as well as perspective on how they see balanced approaches evolving.

WATCH
Reason #1: 2022 was an anomaly, not the norm
Last year stands out as the only time in the past 45 years that both stocks and bonds declined in tandem for a full calendar year. “The culprit for the chaos in both stocks and bonds last year was the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes,” Hoag says. “I think it’s very reasonable to say that bonds will go back to offering diversification benefits as we near the end of the tightening cycle.”
Applbaum says such correlation between the two asset classes won’t likely repeat soon. “With stocks and bonds correlated in terms of their returns, I believe last year reflected an inflection point, not a new normal,” she says.
Most investors had never faced a year as challenging as 2022

Stock returns represented by the S&P 500 Index. Bond returns represented by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
Once the Fed gets inflation under reasonable control, it will have more flexibility, and investors can likely expect bond markets to zig when stock markets zag.
Reason #2: Attractive income is back in fixed income
If there’s a silver lining to the aggressive Fed action, it’s that most classes of bonds are offering significantly higher yields than a year ago. The yield on the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index, a widely used benchmark for investment-grade (BBB/Baa and above) bond markets, was 4.25% as of January 25, 2023. That compares to 1.75% on December 31, 2021. The yields for the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Investment Grade Index and Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High Yield Index stood at 4.96% and 8.16%, respectively, on January 25.
Dating back to the 2008–2009 global financial crisis, historically low rates meant that investors were not able to count on bonds to make much of a contribution to a portfolio’s total return. But with bonds offering higher potential income today, investors may be able to take less risk with their equity investments and still meet their return expectations.
“Today many core bonds can provide a dependable return in the mid-single digits,” Applbaum says. “And investors who are comfortable taking a little more risk by including some investment-grade and high-yield bonds can look for their bond portfolios to potentially contribute even more to a portfolio’s total return. That means you can take less risk with respect to your allocation to stocks in your pursuit of income and total return.”
Reason #3: Dividends can make a difference
If a bond portfolio can provide mid-single digit returns or better, dividends can potentially contribute to an attractive overall return picture within a portfolio’s equity allocation — without taking undue risk.
Historically, dividend-paying stocks have tended to be less volatile than growth stocks. And although dividends accounted for a slim 16% of total return for the S&P 500 Index in the 2010s, historically they have contributed an average 38% from January 1, 1926, to November 30, 2022. In the inflationary 1970s, they climbed to more than 70%.
Many investor portfolios don’t focus on dividend payers
Sources: Capital Group, FactSet and Morningstar. Totals may not reconcile due to rounding. The average advisor portfolio is representative of the aggregate exposures of 543 portfolios analyzed by Capital Group’s Portfolio Consulting and Analytics team from 10/1/2022 to 12/31/2022. The American Funds Moderate Growth and Income Model Portfolio represents the most recent available data calculated as of 12/31/2022. This model aligns closely to the broad asset allocation of the average advisor portfolio.
“For the first time in a long time, I get to talk about the importance of dividends in terms of shareholder returns,” says Applbaum. “When interest rates were zero, companies really didn't have to think about their cost of capital. They could have lower hurdle rates in terms of returns on investment. Now that capital isn’t free they must be more thoughtful about how they can get the best return on investment, in addition to being thoughtful about when it makes more sense to return money to shareholders in the form of dividends.”
Bottom line: Look for better returns, lower risk in 2023
There are several reasons investors can expect a 60/40 portfolio to deliver better potential returns and lower volatility in 2023 and beyond. Bonds today are offering higher yields than a year ago, and with the Fed taking a less aggressive approach to rate hikes lately, interest rate volatility will likely be more muted. Valuations across a range of stocks are more attractive than they were a year ago as well.
But it is important to remember that there is more to balanced investing than deciding on how much equity and how much fixed income to include in a portfolio. “These aren’t monolithic allocations,” explains Applbaum. “For example, growth stocks and dividend payers offer very different risk-reward profiles. So successful balanced investing depends not simply on how much equity is in a portfolio but also what kind of equity is in a portfolio.”
A balanced portfolio would have outpaced other strategies over the past 16 years
Sources: Capital Group, Bloomberg Index Services Ltd., FTSE Russell, ICE Benchmark Administration Ltd., MSCI, Refinitiv Datastream, Standard & Poor's. Returns figures are as of December 31, 2022. ""Buy the dip"" strategy represents buying the prior year's worst performing asset class every year. ""Ride the wave"" strategy represents buying the prior year's best performing asset class every year. ""Balanced portfolio"" strategy represents maintaining a 60/40 split between U.S. large cap stocks (represented by the S&P 500 Index) and U.S. core bonds (represented by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index). This assumes the portfolios are rebalanced annually. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods. 
“Last year many types of asset allocation models failed to deliver on their pursuit of solid returns with moderate risk,” Applbaum adds. “But that followed a long period of relative success. Asset allocation is not a broken or failed strategy. It will always make sense to think about balance, diversification and risk in portfolios. But a one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t work. It’s about building portfolios from the bottom up that align with investor objectives.”

5,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/china-what-drive-markets-2023.html,China: What could drive its markets in 2023,China,"January 31, 2023","As nearly three years of lockdowns come to an end in China, will 2023 be a turning point for equity investors?
Without a doubt, China’s equity risk premium is higher than other markets. As investment professionals with more than 25 years of experience following China, we believe the higher premium is due to the government’s repeated intervention and influence in the economy and markets, as well as geopolitical uncertainty. We also recognize that China’s economic recovery could be uneven and trade-related tensions with the U.S. will likely persist.
However, China’s equities markets have been rallying this year on the country’s abrupt departure from strict COVID policies. Some sectors have been buoyed by more supportive measures for the property market and encouraging regulatory developments for technology companies. We’ve learned from experience that volatility can mask buying opportunities in China. We believe this could be one of those times, particularly for select companies well positioned for an economic rebound, but also for those that remain aligned with the Common Prosperity goals of the administration.
Here are a few themes to consider for investing in China and why we are constructive:
1. Reopening could be a positive catalyst for valuations
China’s departure from its zero-COVID policy removes a headwind to stocks and could be a catalyst for a positive rerating of Chinese equities. The MSCI China Index has already surged more than 50% (as of January 23) after reaching a multiyear low October 31, 2022, and we believe it has more room to run. Valuations for almost all sectors are still trading below their 10-year average on a consensus price-to-earnings (P/E) basis for the next 12 months. We don’t anticipate the market will rally indefinitely, but we sense downside risks have lessened, given that sentiment had become so dire since 2021.
The ability for people to move more freely should trigger a change in consumer behavior and lead to a recovery in domestic consumption. Beneficiaries of this shift will likely be hotel companies, online travel firms, airport operators and luxury goods makers. Airports are busy again as people seek to travel inside and outside the country. There’s been a surge in hotel bookings in China’s larger cities, and consumers are flocking back to shopping malls. 
Many sectors trade at steep discounts

Increased mobility may also benefit certain financial services providers whose sales agents rely on face-to-face meetings to drive new business. Casino operators in Macau, where travel is opening up after heavy restrictions, could benefit too. 
We think a cyclical recovery could boost the outlook for China’s larger banks, which on a P/E basis currently trade for three or four times consensus earnings expectations for the next 12 months. Valuations for Chinese banks have been depressed for many years. But they compressed further in 2022 on China’s weak growth and liquidity crunch in the property market.
2. Government is committed to stabilizing the property market
As part of its message that “housing is for living, not for speculation,” Beijing has sought to contain the rapid appreciation in residential property prices and reduce excess leverage. However, its various policy decisions have not always had the intended outcome. Many property developers are struggling financially, some have defaulted on debt payments, and homebuyers have become more cautious.
Recent actions have made it clear that the government recognizes it has to fix the property sector, which represents about 25% of GDP and roughly 60% of household balance sheets. Authorities have provided hundreds of billions of dollars to help complete unfinished projects, loosened down-payment requirements and lowered mortgage rates. These measures, among others, should help restore consumer confidence and minimize bankruptcies. We think government leaders have little choice but to keep introducing new policies to bolster the property market until they can rectify the situation. 
Homebuying in China has slumped 
Sources: Capital Group, National Bureau of Statistics of China, Refinitiv Datastream. China home sales above are represented by the quarterly sales volume of commercial residential buildings in current prices. As of December 31, 2022.
After what is likely to be a wave of consolidation and limitations on development, the property market will likely become a smaller part of the economy longer term. It should also be operated more sensibly and far less on speculation. Volume growth will likely be more measured and selling prices more constrained to make housing more affordable. This could be an opportunity for higher quality developers who have maintained stronger balance sheets to gain market share and consolidate their leadership positions.
3. Regulatory fog is clearing over China’s tech sector
The most stringent policy measures to curb overreach in China’s technology sector may be behind us. These were aimed at controlling excesses in the private economy and curbing monopolistic behavior. Moving forward, it’s clear growth for technology companies will be more constrained due to regulation but also because the industry has matured.
Valuations for internet-related companies remain depressed by historical standards. The downside seems more limited now assuming conservative earnings growth. But we do not expect a significant rerating for these companies, because revenue growth rates probably won’t reach 30% to 40% again.
On the upside, the regulatory environment appears to be improving. For example, Tencent and NetEase have received long-awaited approvals for new video game licenses. Ant Group, whose high-profile initial public offering was halted in 2020, was recently allowed to start raising capital from new investors. 
Government regulators reportedly plan to take special 1% equity stakes (known as “golden shares”) in units of Tencent and Alibaba, similar to those taken at TikTok owner ByteDance and Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. We think this signals that Beijing’s rectification process is nearing an end. 
How much risk is priced in? Tech valuations have compressed
Sources: MSCI, RIMES. Forward price-to-earnings ratio reflects the current share price relative to the consensus estimate for earnings per share on a forward 12-month basis. Data as of November 30, 2022.
China’s internet giants have narrowed their business focus and adjusted their cost structures by exiting business lines and laying off employees. They’ve also made a massive shift in expansion and growth strategies. Instead of seeking out large-scale acquisitions, they have divested from equity stakes in other tech firms and used excess cash to buy back shares or pay special dividends to shareholders.
We believe that innovation will also continue to drive growth. China’s video game platforms, payment systems and e-commerce have been areas of tremendous innovation over the past decade, and this should continue to drive growth. As many companies find a new rhythm in the evolved regulatory regime, we expect new technologies to be new sources of revenues and earnings.
4. Beijing needs more growth to support policy agenda
It’s our belief that China wants a growing and dynamic economy characterized by a significant degree of innovation. We believe Communist Party leaders know this cannot be accomplished by state-owned businesses alone and that private enterprise is needed to achieve long-term economic goals.
China’s equity risk premium (an excess return that investing in stocks can provide over a risk-free rate typically represented by Treasuries) is higher than other markets. That’s understandable as government policy has a much greater influence on companies and industries in China than it does in most other major markets. For this reason, we expect the risk premium will remain higher. Our investment analysts incorporate regulatory risk into their analyses like they do other risks and give it the appropriate valuation. Different portfolio managers at Capital Group may take divergent views on these risks. As investors with experience in emerging markets, we believe fundamental bottom-up research can uncover opportunities while accounting for the top-down risks. 
China’s biopharmaceutical industry, which is closely aligned with the government’s domestic policy agenda, is a longer term potential opportunity with a long runway for growth. Several well-capitalized companies are developing innovative drugs that have the potential to be sold around the world. Multinationals have also partnered with Chinese firms such as BeiGene and Innovent to develop new drugs and sell them in China’s large market. 
China also wants to bolster its manufacturing prowess and retain dominance in certain areas of the global supply chain, such as electric vehicles (EVs). China has become a global leader in battery development, a key supplier of other materials and a large EV manufacturer in its own right. 
Stock picking in China has been crucial over the past decade

5. A reset in U.S-China relations
There have been steps in the right direction to help reset relations between the U.S. and China, which could help alleviate pressure on Chinese assets. 
Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping held constructive talks at November’s G-20 meeting. U.S. audit regulators were granted deeper access to inspect the books of Chinese companies that trade on U.S. stock exchanges, helping ease concerns that the companies could be delisted. Chinese biopharmaceutical companies were also removed from the U.S. Commerce Department’s unverified list regarding access to facility inspections.
Of course, China’s strategy and approach to Taiwan remain the biggest unknown and risk.
Overall direction looking more positive
We think we are past the point of peak pessimism on China. The reopening of the economy will be a catalyst to stimulate domestic consumption, which should provide a boost to many other areas, even though the overall nominal GDP growth rate may remain muted. From our experience investing in China, the bull phase is not as strong as investor enthusiasm, and the bottom is not as deep as investors fear.
No doubt there will be ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainties, but as the world’s second largest economy reopens, we also see many investment opportunities. Companies tapping into travel, entertainment, higher quality goods, better health care, technology innovation and renewable energy could be long-term beneficiaries. Current valuations provide good entry points for many of them. But in China as much as in any market, fundamental research and a deep knowledge of companies are a must for successful investing and determining the appropriate level of exposure.

6,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/4-trends-could-power-industrial-renaissance.html,4 trends could power an industrial renaissance,Global Equities,"January 19, 2023","Weighing in at 1.37 million pounds and with tires twice the height of a grown man, Caterpillar’s 797 trucks are a sight to behold.
On a recent research trip, members of Capital Group’s investment team watched firsthand as a 797 hauled tons of material from an oil sand field in northern Alberta, Canada, to be processed into oil.
You won’t likely glimpse one of these massive vehicles on the road. But many more such trucks may soon be rolling off the assembly line amid rising demand for new sources of energy and rare minerals to produce batteries for electric vehicles and power storage operations.
The race to find new energy sources is one of four major trends reshaping the world’s economies and markets: Energy transition in the U.S., energy security in Europe, reshoring supply chains and rising defense spending. These multi-year trends are setting the stage for a capital investment super-cycle that could drive opportunity for a wide range of industrial companies, lower U.S. energy costs and help revive American manufacturing.
“Well-positioned industrial companies — from capital equipment suppliers to aerospace and defense companies — are enablers of these trends, and leading companies across many of these industries may be poised for a period of sustained growth,” says equity investment analyst Gigi Pardasani, who covers U.S. large-cap industrials.
Here, Pardasani, equity portfolio manager Andrew Suzman and equity analyst Dominic Phillips share their perspective on the potential for a coming industrial renaissance.
1. Powering the U.S. energy transition
Growth in renewable energy has been an investment theme for at least a decade, thanks to the declining cost of renewable power. Last year renewable energy surpassed coal power in the U.S., with wind, solar and hydropower generating 22% of the country’s electricity.
With the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and the Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act enacted in 2021, the U.S. federal government has dedicated hundreds of billions of dollars in tax and fiscal incentives for infrastructure and expansion of a U.S. renewable energy industry.
“We think about renewable energy a lot in terms of the electric car, but power consumption in factories and businesses is a huge piece of that transition,” says Phillips, an equity investment analyst who covers U.S. technology systems, utilities and renewables. “Today, the transition to renewables makes economic sense for energy companies, consumers and the broader U.S. economy. And these incentives provide investors long-term visibility into a declining cost curve and capital expenditure (capex) spending growth.”
The U.S. has committed billions for infrastructure and renewable energy
Sources: Capital Group, Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Figures above reflect total estimated federal outlays from the CBO as compiled by Capital Group. Totals may not add up due to rounding. CBO estimates for both bills are as of August 2022.
These laws provide funding to modernize the power grid, build high voltage transmission lines and mine the rare minerals needed to manufacture batteries for storing variable energy sources like wind and solar. “Collectively these steps will generate potential demand for a range of electrical equipment makers, as well as industrial conglomerates that offer a wide range of services and developers of advanced battery energy storage systems,” says Pardasani.
What is still underappreciated, though, is just how transformative this ultimately could be for U.S. manufacturing and the broader economy.
Unlike coal or natural gas, renewables like wind and solar power have essentially zero variable costs. “Once you build out the infrastructure, there's only some small maintenance costs attached to it,” explains Phillips. “This could effectively collapse the price of power in the U.S. and provide a major competitive advantage to a wide range of manufacturers from steel to textiles to consumer goods to chemicals.”
This in turn could have a positive impact on U.S. GDP growth. The potential collapse in power prices represents a huge productivity jump, according to Pardasani. “That’s because power is the number one fixed-cost input to a manufacturer, to oil and gas extraction, and to metals and mining,” she says. “Paying potentially 90% lower power costs will enable massive productivity and margin gains that can be recycled into higher wages and more capital investments. I can see ‘Made in the USA’ becoming a byword for growth again.”
2. Seeking energy security in Europe
Europe has been ahead of the U.S. in transitioning to renewable energy, but now faces the challenge of securing its supply amid the war in Ukraine, as Russia has effectively cut off oil and gas to Europe. “Today, we are in a global energy crisis, and it is most acutely felt in Europe,” says Phillips.
The result has been a renewed focus on energy security. Countries in Europe are seeking to rely less on unstable regimes and seek out other sources.
Liquid natural gas producers could be clear beneficiaries of this sea change — particularly U.S.-based liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies, which are among the lowest cost producers in the world.
Cheniere Energy, for example, recently announced it will spend $8 billion over the next three years to expand its massive LNG facility in Corpus Christi, Texas. More than 70% of Cheniere’s supplies are now headed for Europe, up from roughly 40% a year ago. “Many countries have come to realize that their national security depends on stable energy streams,” says Andrew Suzman, an equity portfolio manager for EuroPacific Growth Fund®. “It’s going to have a lot of implications for the energy sector as well as the industrial companies needed to build the infrastructure.”
For example, Caterpillar makes pipelayers and other materials used to help transport natural gas from its source to a facility and ultimately offshore. “The company offers machinery and vehicles that can help with both energy security needs and the energy transition,” says Pardasani.
3. Reshoring supply chains
Just as many countries are seeking greater security in their energy supply, many companies are improving the security of their supply chains by rebuilding them closer to home and end markets.
Decades of globalization to maximize efficiency and minimize cost left many companies exposed to broken supply chains caused by COVID lockdowns and rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China.

As of 1/17/23.
The pandemic served as a wake-up call, as government shutdowns resulted in snarled supply chains that lasted well beyond the reopening of economies. Companies began to recognize the importance of more local suppliers as well as the wisdom of sacrificing maximum efficiency in favor of some redundancy in case of future breakdowns.
“Manufacturers realized that they needed more resilience, which is to say visibility into their supply chain, the flexibility to change over the types of production and remote monitoring,” Pardasani says. “Resilience also means backup plans in case something happens to the facility, a supplier or employees.”
In January, Korean solar panel company Hanwha Q CELLS disclosed plans to construct a $2.5 billion manufacturing complex in Georgia. And last December Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) disclosed plans to spend $12 billion to build a second chip factory in Arizona, scheduled to be in operation in 2024. TSMC is also building a semiconductor plant in Japan and has plans to make infrastructure investments in Europe.
Intel is building a research facility near Plateau de Saclay, France. The company had disclosed that France will become its European headquarters for high performance computing and artificial intelligence design. And Europe itself has recently opened LNG terminals on Germany’s north coast to receive imports from the U.S. and elsewhere.
As companies build new factories, they seek to offset some of those costs by adopting the latest and most efficient technology. For example, Japanese industrial company Keyence develops automation sensors, vision systems and measuring instruments for a range of manufacturing operations, and SMC produces pneumatic and electric automation equipment.
In the U.S., Rockwell Automation provides controls, software and automation equipment for a wide range of factories, including many automakers. “Rockwell has a particular presence in solar energy,” Pardasani says. “So they’re seeking to do for solar what they’ve already done for the auto industry.”
4. Rising defense spending
In addition to driving the need for reshoring supply chains, geopolitical tensions are fueling an increase in defense spending around the world. The war in Ukraine underscores a trend that has been growing for years. Several major developed nations, including Germany, Japan and others, have disclosed plans to significantly increase defense budgets.
The U.S. continues to take steps to help its allies in Europe and Asia defend themselves. The Biden administration recently asked Congress for approval to sell $20 billion in F-16 fighter jets to Turkey and sought approval for a similar deal to sell F-35 fighters to Greece. In December, Raytheon Technologies began supplying Ukraine and other European nations with defense equipment.
“We are living in a world with heightened geopolitical tensions,” says Suzman. “While this is unfortunate, it presents opportunity for well-managed defense contractors. I believe we will see defense budgets rise from here.”
Of course, not all defense companies are equal, nor will all necessarily benefit — the key is to understand which have the most effective innovations, are best positioned to execute on their business plans and overcome challenges like supply chain issues.

Bottom line: A rising capex tide could lift many ships
“In stark contrast to a lot of the gloom in news headlines, I view this as a time for optimism and excitement for industrials, even if there is a recession,” says Pardasani.
Arguably, industrials have already been through recession. “While the digital and service sectors thrived post pandemic, companies that produce hard assets have been in crisis with lockdowns, trouble retaining employees, skyrocketing costs and supply chain woes,” adds Pardasani. “Today, many of the best-positioned companies are attractively valued and stand to benefit from a period of strong growth.”
Rising capital spending could spark an industrial renaissance

""Other sectors"" above include combined estimated capital expenditures across consumer staples, health care, real estate and financials.
The potential long-term benefits reach beyond the industrials sector. Nimble companies across power generation, metals and mining, energy and manufacturing that make the right investments could enjoy a sustained growth cycle.
“For more than a decade, as investors focused on technology and digital consumer businesses, companies often viewed major capital investment initiatives as a negative, but you can’t build the new economy without old industries,” stresses Pardasani. “Many people may be underestimating the potential of large-scale capital expenditures today to drive profit growth for years to come.”

Inflation soared. Central banks aggressively increased interest rates, reversing a 40-year cycle of falling rates. Asset prices tumbled, and war broke out in Ukraine.
What’s next for 2023? Heading into the new year, inflation remains elevated, the war in Ukraine drags on, and with recession looming in the U.S. and abroad, investors will likely see additional market volatility. Some of these developments are seismic shifts that will likely reshape the investment landscape for years to come.

1. Make dividends a bigger part of your portfolio
During the recent bull market, investors had to get one thing right: Recognize that leading U.S. internet companies with strong growth potential could generate the greatest returns.
In today’s more volatile markets, with the cost of capital rising and investors less eager to pay up for high-multiple growth stocks, dividends are getting more attention. “We are at the start of what I expect will be a renewed and durable appreciation of the role dividends can play in investor portfolios,” says Caroline Randall, a portfolio manager with Capital Income Builder®. “Going forward, dividends should be a more significant and stable contributor to total returns.”
While dividends accounted for a slim 16% of total return for the S&P 500 Index in the 2010s, historically they have contributed 38% on average. In the inflationary 1970s they climbed to more than 70%. “When you expect growth in the single digits, dividends can give you a head start,” Randall adds. “They may also offer a measure of downside protection when volatility rises.”
Dividends have historically been a larger percentage of total return
Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. 2020s data is from 1/1/26 through 11/30/22. *Total return for the S&P 500 Index was negative for the 2000s. Dividends provided a 1.8% annualized return over the decade. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
Of course, not all dividends are created equal. During the pandemic, for example, many companies reduced or eliminated dividend payments. That is why it is essential to understand the sustainability of dividends and invest selectively, Randall notes. “I closely scrutinize company management actions to gauge how committed they are to maintaining and growing dividends over time.”
Companies that have paid steady and above-market dividends can be found across the financial, energy, materials and health care sectors, among others. For example, UnitedHealth Group, the largest private provider of managed health care to Americans, has grown its dividend and likely will continue to do so even in a tougher economy, Randall says.
In many markets outside the U.S., dividends have historically made up an even bigger part of the investment landscape. As of October 31, 2022, about 600 companies headquartered in international and emerging markets, as measured by the MSCI All Country World ex USA Index, offered hefty dividend yields between 3% and 6%, compared to only 121 in the United States.

2. Seek more from your international stocks
For years, maintaining sizable investments in international stocks has required patience and a strong stomach. After all, returns for non-U.S. markets have persistently lagged the U.S. amid waves of disappointing economic and geopolitical developments.
A look at news headlines suggests more of the same in 2023. A strong U.S. dollar, the war in Ukraine, and weak economies in Europe, Japan and emerging markets have created a cloudy near-term outlook.
That said, in many cases much of this news is priced into markets, explains Andrew Suzman, a portfolio manager with EuroPacific Growth Fund®. “Strong global businesses in Europe and Asia are trading at what I believe are compelling valuations. If the news simply gets less bad, shares for many of them could rebound.”
Investors would also do well to remember that there’s a difference between top-down macroeconomic conditions and the fundamental, bottom-up prospects for individual companies. Now more than ever, company-specific developments are driving returns outside the U.S., placing added importance on rigorous investment research and individual stock picking.
Company-specific factors have had a large and growing impact on returns
Source: Empirical Research Partners. As of 9/30/22. Analysis provided by Empirical Research Partners using their developed market and emerging market stock universes that approximate the MSCI World Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index, respectively. Data shows the percentage of market returns that can be attributed to various factors over time, using a two-year smoothed average. A smoothed moving average is a method of reducing short-term fluctuations in data and is calculated by using a weighted average of values (based on the entire period) applied over a specified period of time (in this case two years) on a rolling basis. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
For many multinational companies headquartered in struggling economic areas, national conditions often have little or no impact on revenues, except perhaps when it comes to regulation and taxes.
Consider, for example, luxury eyewear maker EssilorLuxottica. “This is an Italian company, but it sells eyewear in the U.S., Asia and across Europe,” Suzman says. “Its prospects have little to do with the Italian economy and a lot to do with global demand for luxury goods.” Similarly, interest in European aircraft maker Airbus has more to do with travel demand in the U.S. and China.
Likewise in emerging markets, interest in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company reflects the universal demand for computer chips, according to Gerald du Manoir, principal investment officer for American Funds® International Vantage Fund. “Granted, the outlook for some economies doesn’t look too compelling, but I feel confident that we can still find promising companies in Europe, Japan and emerging markets.”

3. Strengthen your core bond portfolio
In 2022, core bond portfolios failed to do what was expected: fulfill their traditional role as a ballast against market volatility. In a year when global stocks slid 14.5%, investment-grade bonds (BBB/Baa and above) declined 12.8%.
It is understandable if investors are disappointed, but outcomes like this have been rare. In fact, last year was the only time in the past 45 years that stocks and bonds fell in tandem. The conditions that led to this outcome also have been rare. At a time when rates were near or below zero, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks initiated a series of aggressive rate hikes to tamp down inflation.
Stocks and bonds have rarely declined in tandem
Sources: Capital Group, Bloomberg Index Services Ltd., MSCI. Returns above reflect annual total returns in USD for all years except 2022, which reflect the year-to-date total return for both indexes. As of 11/30/2022. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
That should change in 2023. Inflation has already shown signs of slowing. At its December meeting, the Fed moderated its approach and lifted rates by just a half percentage point to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. But officials underscored that they will continue to raise rates, with the potential to go above 5% next year. Further evidence of slower inflation or slowing growth could allow the Fed to further slow or pause its rate hikes.
“I believe we are close to that point,” says Pramod Atluri, fixed income portfolio manager. “Once the Fed eases, high-quality bonds should again offer relative stability and greater income.”
Core bond allocations should generally have a place in diversified portfolios, but they become more important as recession concerns take center stage. “I am seeing more opportunities now that bonds have repriced lower,” Atluri says. “Valuations are attractive, so I am selectively adding corporate credit. Bonds now offer a much healthier income stream, which should help offset any price declines.”

4. Tap into credit markets for higher income
There is an upside to the painful bond market losses of 2022. Declining bond prices set the stage for higher income going forward.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury was 3.88% on December 30, 2022, versus a yield of 1.51% on December 31, 2021. Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, have soared across sectors. Over time, income should increase since the total return of a bond fund consists of price changes and interest paid, and the interest component is higher.
Yields have soared across asset classes
Sources: Bloomberg, Bloomberg Index Services Ltd., JPMorgan. As of 11/30/22. Sector yields above include Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index, Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Investment Grade Index, Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High Yield Index, 50% J.P. Morgan EMBI Global Diversified Index/50% J.P. Morgan GBI-EM Global Diversified Index blend and Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index. Period of time considered from 2020 to present. Dates for recent lows from top to bottom in chart shown are: 8/4/20, 12/31/20, 7/6/21, 1/4/21 and 7/27/21. Yields shown are yield to worst. Yield to worst is the lowest yield that can be realized by either calling or putting on one of the available call/put dates or holding a bond to maturity. ""Change"" figures may not reconcile due to rounding. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
With investors better compensated for holding relatively stable bonds, the question of whether to invest in riskier corporate or high-yield bonds ahead of a potential recession is an important one.
One surprising element has been the resilience of consumers. Despite gloomy headlines, consumers continue to open their wallets. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of the economy, and spending has been relatively resilient despite high inflation.
“This has helped keep corporate balance sheets in pretty good shape,” says Damien McCann, fixed income portfolio manager for American Funds® Multi-Sector Income Fund.
The reward potential for corporate investment-grade bonds at current levels is enticing, but many are vulnerable in a downturn. “I expect credit quality to weaken as the economy slows. In that environment, I prefer defensive sectors such as health care over homebuilders and retail,” McCann adds.

5. Don’t sit on the sidelines
A steady drumbeat of bad news can be discouraging to even the most seasoned investors.
But well-managed companies adjust to shifting conditions, and ultimately the best companies have learned to thrive in the new reality. Markets themselves have a history of adjusting to setbacks. Indeed, stock markets historically have recovered before a recession ends, anticipating a better future ahead. If history is a guide, they could rebound about six months before the economy does.
What is important for investors is to stick with their long-term investment plans. Abrupt and dramatic change often triggers powerful emotions that can lead to impulsive action, like moving cash to the sidelines. From May 2022 through the end of the year, investors shifted about $160 billion into money market funds, according to the Office of Financial Research. But taking your money out of the market on the way down means that if you don’t get back in at exactly the right time, you can’t capture the full benefit of a recovery.
Missing just a few of the market’s best days can hurt investment returns
Sources: Capital Group, MSCI, RIMES. As of 12/31/21. MSCI returns above reflect total returns, including the impact of reinvested dividends.
Even missing a few trading days can take a toll. Consider an example of a hypothetical $1,000 investment in the MSCI ACWI from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2021. An investment for the full period would have grown to $3,065. But missing even the 10 best days of the subsequent 10 years would have significantly hurt long-term results — and the more missed “good” days, the more missed opportunities.
The strongest gains have often occurred immediately after a bottom. Therefore, waiting on the sidelines for an economic turnaround is not a recommended strategy.
“No one will blow a bugle to give the all-clear signal,” Suzman adds. “So I am looking beyond the near-term challenges and seeking companies that I believe represent good value over the next few years. After major moves in the stock market, it could be time to review your portfolio to ensure it is well-diversified, reflects the right level of risk and is aligned with your investment objectives.

Bonds
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable. While not directly correlated to changes in interest rates, the values of inflation linked bonds generally fluctuate in response to changes in real interest rates and may experience greater losses than other debt securities with similar durations. The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds. Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer’s creditworthiness. If agency ratings differ, the security will be considered to have received the highest of those ratings, consistent with the fund’s investment policies.

8,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/dividends-building-resilience-in-new-market-reality.html,Dividends: Building resilience in a new market reality,Dividends,"December 21, 2022","The market pivot away from growth stocks over the past year has brought the dividend component of  total stock returns back into focus. Dividend payers in the S&P 500 Index have outpaced the broader market by a significant margin over the past 12 months. With the U.S. Federal Reserve intent on tightening monetary policy to contain inflation, investors will likely continue to be less willing to pay up for high-multiple stocks, and dividends should remain in focus.
We asked two of our portfolio managers who have experience managing strategies with a focus on dividends and preservation of capital to share their thoughts. Alan Berro, principal investment officer (PIO)  of  Washington Mutual Investors FundSM, and Will Robbins, PIO of American Mutual Fund®,  discuss how they are navigating the current investing environment and offer their medium-term outlook.
1. Looking for near-term visibility of cash flow and earnings
For now, we prefer companies where there is greater visibility on near-term cash flows and earnings, and sufficient pricing power to help blunt the impact of inflation. We see opportunities across industries within energy, industrials and health care.
So long as the cash flows and earnings are visible and can easily support the dividend, we prefer to continue to hold them in these portfolios. Johnson & Johnson is an example of a company that has spanned the value and growth spectrum. It has continued to deliver on its three business lines: pharmaceuticals, medical devices and consumer products. Its acquisition strategy has expanded its portfolio of innovative products, and it’s been a consistent dividend payer. 
Dividends can be an important component of total return
Source: Standard and Poor’s. Data as of September 30, 2022.
The repricing that we are seeing in many traditional areas of growth — such as software, social media, digital payments and semiconductors — could create select opportunities for us, though valuations and fundamentals may not be there yet. We will need to see business models adjust to the new reality of higher interest rates, scarcer availability of capital, readjustment of supply chains and higher labor costs.
The sustainability of the dividend matters to us. In the past decade of a growth-led market, corporate management teams juggled between share buybacks and paying a dividend as a way to allocate excess cash. Where appropriate, we are encouraging companies to maintain or grow the dividend.
Once established, managements are reluctant to cut the dividend. Therefore, we find that dividends impose a level of discipline on management teams in how they manage their capital structure. Many investors know this, but it’s worth restating that over the past 96 years, about 38% of the total return for the S&P 500 Index has come from dividends.
We are not dogmatic about the growth-value divide. Many well-known companies have swung between value and growth over the past two decades. Home Depot and UnitedHealth Group are two examples. Over the years, we have invested in select companies with lower price-to-earnings multiples and have held them in our dividend-oriented strategies even as valuation multiples expanded — if the combination of business fundamentals and the dividend continued to provide an attractive total return proposition.
Stocks can shift between value and growth classifications
Sources: Capital Group, FactSet. Graphic shows examples of companies that have been classified as either 100% growth or value at certain times in the Russell 1000 Index over the past 20 years. Companies were in the top 20 in terms of weighting in the benchmark. Data as of June 30, 2022.
2. Cyclicals are investible even in a recessionary economy
The traditional view that cyclicals should be avoided in a recessionary economy doesn't hold up as well today. Company managements have become more sophisticated in how they manage their inventory, supply chains and productivity, as well as their capital structure, to avoid boom-bust cycles. As a result, many of these companies — think energy, industrials and autos — could be better positioned to remain profitable even at the bottom of an economic cycle.
The energy sector in the S&P 500 has had the best returns for the 12-month period ended October 31. And we could see energy stocks continue to hold up even as the economy weakens. Even as the energy transition continues, it's going to take a long time to switch over the nation's vehicle fleet. Oil companies are not expanding capital expenditures aggressively, and in fact are reluctant to explore for new oil sources despite higher prices. Hence, supply is not increasing and energy resources are not being replenished.
In any case, many of these oil giants can remain profitable even if oil retreats to around $50 a barrel. And oil multinationals, such as ExxonMobil and Chevron, are likely to maintain their substantial dividends, given their large income-oriented investor base.
Exploration and production (E&P) companies have become savvy at balancing capital-intensive business needs while paying a more sustainable dividend. Historically, E&P companies had not been high dividend payers, choosing instead to reinvest in the business to pursue more growth in production. In addition to their regular dividends, ConocoPhillips, Pioneer Natural Resources and EOG Resources are now supplementing with variable or special dividends, depending on commodities prices and the strength of cash flows.
Oil-related companies offer above-average dividend yields
Source: FactSet. Data as of October 31, 2022.
In the industrials sector, we are finding less cyclical businesses. One example is waste companies that haul and recycle trash for residential and commercial customers. They can be a good hedge against inflation since many municipal waste contracts in the United States are indexed to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which was at a 40-year high of 8.2% at the end of September. These companies, which benefit from limited competition, are also fairly recession-resistant: Trash needs to be collected, no matter what kind of shape the economy is in.
Defense company revenues are influenced more by government budgetary cycles and less by the traditional economic cycle. Industry stalwarts, such as Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, have been known for their steady dividends and cash flow strength. 
Defense budgets are going up amid rising geopolitical tensions. In addition, both the U.S. and governments in European countries have been taking actions to bring supply chains closer to home on national security grounds after decades of globalization.
3. Opportunities in sweet spot of dividend universe
We find many more opportunities in the middle of the dividend yield stack. As is well-known, very high dividend yields can be a sign of risk. They can be a result of a price selloff, implying doubt in the sustainability of the dividend. At the other end of the spectrum, a low yield is often typical for higher growth stocks and may not provide sufficient cushion for stock price volatility.
In the past decade, we saw many companies with low dividend yields and middling growth rates offer a very small dividend to keep investors interested. That paradigm may not hold anymore with 10-year Treasury rates currently in the 4% range.
Today, we find the greatest opportunity in dividend stocks yielding between 2% and 5%. In addition to industrials and energy stocks, health care and financials are other sectors in this yield bucket.
Health care is an area that has grown to become a viable source of dividends and total return. The sector is becoming more diverse, drug discovery trends are accelerating, and productivity of research and development spending is improving. Plus, companies have demonstrated a focus on sustaining their dividends.
Greatest opportunities lie in sweet spot of yield universe
Source: FactSet. Data as of September 30, 2022.
While gene cell therapy and obesity drugs are well-known areas of growth, innovation is accelerating broadly in many areas after a decade of drugmaker reliance on modifications to patented drugs. We are at the start of what we think will be a decade of innovation. Valuations for large-cap pharmaceutical companies in the S&P 500 still look reasonable at an aggregate price-to-earnings multiple of 14 times forward earnings, even after strong relative share prices the past year, as we believe they have long runways ahead to grow earnings and dividends.
Many large pharmaceutical companies are also well-capitalized, with plenty of cash on their balance sheets to pay dividends or fund their own growth through acquisitions. This could help in a higher rate world where raising debt capital will be more expensive. There are also other areas of health care — including service providers and insurance companies — where we are seeing an improvement in fundamentals and earnings.
Among financials, we are targeting banks and other companies that can expand their margins in a period of higher rates without being overly exposed to consumer credit risk should we enter into a prolonged recession.
Cash buffers are rising for pharmaceutical companies

Large commercial insurance brokers could thrive in an environment of higher interest rates and inflation. These are highly cash-generative businesses that are less exposed to underwriting risks. They also generate a substantial amount of recurring revenue, which make them more defensive than commercial banks. Lastly, the industry is highly consolidated, leading to attractive pricing opportunities.
4. It’s no longer the world of consumer staples, utilities and telecoms
Dividends were often associated with these “steady Eddies.” But these areas are not the primary focus of our attention today. Consumer staples have historically held up well in market downturns. Now, many of these companies face headwinds from continued cost inflation and potential difficulty in passing along price increases. A stronger dollar is also pressuring top-line growth. Procter & Gamble, for instance, has forecast that unfavorable currency movements are likely to depress its revenue growth by 6% this fiscal year.
Many consumer staples companies — including General Mills, Kellogg’s and Procter & Gamble — also may see their ability to raise prices in a slowing economy blunted by big-box stores like Walmart, one of their largest customers.
Investors traditionally bought utilities for their high yield, even though their businesses were lower growth. Today, many utilities are yielding 2% to 3% and are relatively less attractive to shorter term U.S. Treasury bills that offer investors a new source of potential income. Since utilities continue to trade at a premium to the S&P 500, we continue to be highly selective in this area.

5. Finding resilience in volatile markets
Dividend growth has rebounded from the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic when many companies were forced to substantially cut or eliminate their payments. We do not expect a rash of dividend cuts in a global economic slowdown, but we do anticipate that dividends will grow at a more measured pace.
Many companies are taking a more deliberate approach to management of their capital structure, balancing business needs, capital expenditure plans and their dividend policies. Management teams today want to maintain a steady and sustainable dividend policy that they can support for extended periods, and we think that’s a positive development.
Even in the midst of a very challenging economic and market environment, we are finding attractive opportunities. In an equity market where growth is slowing and fears of a global recession are mounting, we believe it is important to focus on companies with stronger balance sheets and cash flows. Sustainable dividends don’t lie, and dividends could become a much bigger part of the total return equation compared to the past 20 years.

Data going back to December 1989 for the MSCI IMI is not available and, as a result, part of the analysis relies on the S&P Global BMI. These indexes were used to provide a full sampling of stocks in the small-, mid- and large-capitalization universes. The universe constituents were balanced quarterly. All companies in the global universe are split into dividend payers and non-dividend payers. A company was classified as a ""dividend payer"" if it currently pays a dividend. A company was classified as a ""dividend grower"" (a subset of payers) if its trailing 12-month dividend per share increased relative to one year earlier. Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility.

9,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/5-things-know-semiconductors.html,5 things to know about the future of semiconductors,Technology & Innovation,"November 28, 2022","How fast things can change: There was a major shortage of semiconductors at the start of the pandemic, and now the industry is grappling with too much inventory in parts of the supply chain. This has led to a selloff in semiconductor stocks and prompted questions about the depth and duration of this downturn.
The U.S. has also stepped up restrictions on shipments of semiconductors and related equipment to China. Meanwhile, the U.S. and the European Union have laid out plans to reshore semiconductor manufacturing in the interest of national security, which is expected to have longer-term implications for industry efficiency and chip prices.
I recently visited Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, where I met with company management teams and some key industry contacts. Here are some of my current ideas about the state of the semiconductor business.
1. Is this current downturn different than previous semiconductor cycles?
Every cycle is different, and it is difficult to estimate the duration and severity of any slump. However, it would be a mistake to compare this period to previous downturns.
In the 2000–2010 period, most semiconductor downturns were related to supply imbalances that typically took some time to resolve. Multiple foundries were competing for business — sometimes against their own customers — and memory companies in Taiwan and Japan aspired to gain market share. The semiconductor equipment market was also a lot more fragmented. The industry today is more consolidated, and demand is more sustained as semiconductor content has proliferated into everyday applications. Three companies control most leading-edge global chip production: TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing), Samsung Electronics and Intel. Furthermore, the market share of the top five equipment makers has risen to roughly 75% from 40% in the early 2000s.
The current downturn is meaningful, but I believe it is manageable. The slowdown began to manifest in the second quarter of this year when waning demand for consumer electronics, personal computers and smartphones led to a surge in chip inventories. I believe the industry has acted decisively: There have been cuts to previously announced capital spending plans and efforts to curb expenses. The memory chip industry is already an oligopoly led by Micron Technology, SK Hynix and Samsung. These companies have all announced plans to cut capital expenditures far earlier than we’ve witnessed in previous downturns.
Chip stocks have crumbled on inventory and geopolitical concerns
Sources: Capital Group, Refinitiv Datastream. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector is a Philadelphia Stock Exchange capitalization-weighted index composed of the 30 largest U.S. companies primarily involved in the design, distribution, manufacture and sale of semiconductors. Data as of October 31, 2022.
Overall, my sense is that inventories of logic semiconductors, which work as the brains of electronic devices, likely peaked in the third quarter, while inventories of memory chips, which help store data, are still rising and might peak in mid-2023. A correction in analog chips (used in circuits to control signals to logic chips) will likely be slower given their longer product obsolescence cycle and relatively stable pricing. The risk of accruing excess inventories of more advanced chips is lower, because the threat of product obsolescence limits hoarding behavior among distributors and manufacturers.
2. Can the world achieve some semblance of semiconductor self-sufficiency?
My view is no — and I do not think that governments are targeting self-sufficiency. I do believe, however, that the U.S. government will likely be more relaxed if critical advanced chips and the chips for military applications are fabricated on U.S. soil.
After two decades of consolidation, Taiwan dominates the global manufacturing of both leading-edge and less-advanced semiconductors. Together with China, Taiwan also controls most of the market for the testing and assembly of chips and many other parts of the value chain. This has obviously caused a lot of consternation among investors and governments in developed Western countries, especially given heightened geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China and speculation around China’s desire to reunify Taiwan with the mainland.
The challenge is that when it comes to leading-edge semiconductors, many company road maps lead to Taiwan. TSMC works with more than 500 customers worldwide and is the global leader for producing chips at the most advanced-process nodes. The company is currently working with U.S. companies Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Intel and Qualcomm on their next-generation chips for smartphones, video game systems and virtual reality gear. Plus, TSMC is a key maker of data center chips for Google, Amazon and Microsoft.
Taiwan plays an outsized role in chip manufacturing
Source: Capital Group. Data as of 2020. TSMC = Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
TSMC reportedly plans to build a second fabrication plant in Arizona to manufacture more advanced 3-nanometer (nm) chips. Production is slated for the second half of 2025, nearly a year after starting 5nm manufacturing in its first fab in the same location. TSMC has indicated that more than 20% of its manufacturing will be outside Taiwan in the next few years, which might not seem to be that much. However, it would be nearly half of all its leading-edge chip production. I believe that these Arizona fabs will be enough to support all defense-related semiconductor manufacturing and other critical leading-edge chip requirements of the U.S.
Going beyond the strategically critical chips will be tough. The production of more mature chips is concentrated in Taiwan and China; while not impossible to move, it does not seem necessary and offers no strategic advantage. Taiwan and China also are leaders in assembly/test capacity. 
3. What are some ramifications of reshoring semiconductor supply chains?
The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which provides $52.7 billion for American semiconductor development, and a new fund established in Europe aim to bring production to these developed markets. But there’s no doubt that doing so will raise prices. It’s estimated that manufacturing processors in the U.S. could cost 30% to 40% more than in Taiwan and about 15% to 20% more than in South Korea, where most of the current capacity lies.
I believe TSMC will likely shift to a pricing model in which it charges a blended average rate regardless of where it makes the chips. This approach has the potential to support higher prices for chips for some time, reversing the trend of steady price declines that we have seen in the past. In 2023, TSMC plans to increase prices by 6% for all its customers to help mitigate the costs of its overseas expansion in the U.S., Japan and China, which will also be inflationary.
Secondly, rewiring the semiconductor supply chain will be a challenge. The high cost of manufacturing and specialized knowledge required are large hurdles that the industry and policymakers must overcome. One pressing need is for the U.S. to create a larger pool of qualified engineers to run fabs. This won’t happen overnight. By one estimate, Taiwan has roughly 300,000 such engineers, compared with 180,000 in the U.S.
Also, I don’t expect a complete decoupling of the global semiconductor supply chain. A large infusion of capital does not guarantee success or self-sufficiency for any country involved in semiconductors; China is a good example, having reportedly spent $100 billion to build out its domestic chip industry. Furthermore, the sophistication of producing and designing leading-edge semiconductors has grown exponentially — and requires not only the best and brightest talent in the world but also physical materials and tools from various countries.

4. What are potential impacts of the latest U.S. restrictions on semiconductor exports to China?
The U.S. government is stipulating that U.S. chipmakers must obtain a license from the Commerce Department to ship advanced semiconductors and related equipment to China. The restrictions also target shipments from foreign firms that use U.S. equipment.
The measures are no slam dunk. The Biden administration will have to persuade other countries to help impose the restrictions. Based on my recent conversations, I believe that Japanese semiconductor equipment makers are largely on board, while Dutch and South Korean manufacturers seem to oppose controls on equipment sales to China. The Commerce Department is trying to restrict even legacy equipment sales to the Chinese customers currently on its Unverified List (ineligible to receive items subject to the Export Administration Regulations). The aim is to pressure these companies into agreeing to audits and inspections. Success with these restrictions will require all other countries to cooperate, and there is a real risk that U.S. companies could be excluded from future design needs of domestic Chinese firms.
In the long run, memory-chip makers appear to be likely beneficiaries of U.S. attempts to curb the development of China’s semiconductor industry. Recent measures could undercut the growth of China’s state-run memory-chip companies while helping American companies that manufacture processors on U.S. soil.
5. Which industry drivers could power the next upturn?
Despite the sharp selloff in semiconductor stocks, I believe that semiconductors remain a secular growth industry and governments have taken notice. They are essential to security, energy and the overall productivity of economies around the world.
Consider this: It took 40 years for the semiconductor industry to reach its first $200 billion in sales — and only another 17 years to achieve the next $200 billion. I believe that these leaps in sales will happen at an even faster rate over the next decade.
The pace of semiconductor sales is accelerating

Demand for high-performance computing chips (HPC) used in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) functions is a potential driver of further industry growth, with an increase in silicon wafer size rather than unit growth a significant trend within machine learning and AI. Electric vehicles have twice the silicon content of conventional cars, and 5G phones use about 40% more processors than 4G phones. What’s more, demand is growing for virtual reality and augmented reality products. So despite this latest downturn, I believe the industry is positioned to benefit from these powerful tailwinds in the years ahead.

11,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/international-equity-strong-dollar.html,Can international equities overcome a strong dollar?,Global Equities,"October 26, 2022","There’s no denying that the relentless rise of the U.S. dollar has been challenging for investors in international equities. The currency translation effect (that is, losses and gains resulting from the conversion of non-U.S. investment returns into U.S. dollars) has dented international and global equity portfolio results.
There are two ways currency movements can affect investors. In addition to translation effects at the portfolio level, companies within a portfolio may experience business impacts. However, a strong dollar is not always bad news for non-U.S. companies.
Specific companies with solid fundamentals can disproportionately benefit from foreign exchange swings. Exchange-rate volatility can have a big impact on corporate profitability, depending on where a company generates revenue or incurs costs. Companies with significant costs in euros or yen and a lot of revenue in U.S. dollars, for example, could be poised to benefit. In this environment, research is crucial to understanding how exchange-rate volatility can affect profitability. Ultimately, underlying company fundamentals should drive investment decisions rather than near-term currency fluctuations.
How strong is the U.S. dollar?
Sources: Capital Group, ICE Data Services, MSCI, RIMES. As of August 19, 2022.
Strong USD can cut both ways
In today’s global economy, it is common for multinational companies to have geographically diverse income sources, and manufacturing hubs and suppliers located across the world. For example, as of September 14, 2022, companies in the S&P 500 Index derive about 40% of their revenue from outside the United States. When the dollar is strong, this dynamic can put pressure on these companies’ profits, as the money coming in from abroad is not worth as much as it is when the dollar is weak.
The inverse can be true for non-U.S. companies, too. Multiple sectors within the MSCI Europe Index, for example, pull in significant U.S.-dollar-based revenue. Industries that might typically benefit from wide dispersion between the U.S. dollar and other currencies include autos, electronics, shipbuilders, machinery, aerospace and defense, and luxury goods.
Many non-U.S. companies have substantial U.S.-dollar-based revenue
Sources: Capital Group, FactSet, Refinitiv Datastream. Revenue exposure above reflects the weighted average of the percentage of revenue generated in the United States across each index's respective constituents. Constituent lists are current as of August 23, 2022; company-level revenue exposure is estimated by FactSet and is current as of January 2022.
There are several competing factors that can drive profits beyond currency moves, and many companies hedge their currency exposures to help protect their balance sheets from unexpected swings. However, there are numerous examples of non-U.S. companies citing the strong dollar as being beneficial to their bottom line this year. 
One is United Kingdom–based aerospace company BAE, which brings in about 47% of its revenue in dollars. On BAE’s most recent earnings call, executives explained that, “Should the current dollar (exchange) rate persist for the year, there will be a significant tailwind to reported results.” If the pound were to weaken another 10 cents against the dollar, the company estimates its underlying earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) guidance could be retranslated upward by as much as 10%.
French consumer discretionary giant LVMH, which owns luxury goods maker Louis Vuitton, provides another compelling illustration of the positive impact a strong dollar can have on non-U.S. companies. In a recent shareholder presentation, LVMH (which counts about 27% of its revenue in dollars) noted that currency effects have boosted its profits by more than 400 million euros through the first half of 2022. Currency impact alone accounted for about 19% of its improvement in operating profit on a year-over-year basis.
Currency translation can boost earnings growth for select companies
Sources: Capital Group, company filings. Periods above refer to the six-month fiscal periods ending June 30, 2021, and June 30, 2022, respectively.
French drugmaker Sanofi has also been a beneficiary of the strong dollar. It reported that currency effects boosted its sales by nearly 1 billion euros in the first half of 2022 and pushed its earnings per share up by 0.19 euros. 
Dollar poised to stay strong
These factors are likely to be relevant for some time. According to Capital Group currency analyst Jens Sondergaard, the dollar is rising for good reason and may not yet be at its peak. As he explains, the U.S. economy is stronger than that of other major countries, and the U.S. Federal Reserve is aggressively tightening to blunt the impact of inflationary pressures.
In most other parts of the world, it’s a very different story. Outside the U.S., there has been lackluster growth, inflation that’s mostly driven by energy prices and severe compression of real wages. As a result, central banks are being forced into what Sondergaard characterizes as “bad” rate hikes.
The dollar’s ascent appears set to continue

Hedging equities can be challenging
With regard to the currency translation effect, investors seeking to mitigate exchange-rate volatility can, of course, choose to implement a hedging strategy (which would typically use forward currency contracts). Hedging can be appropriate when investors have a view that a given currency is either under- or overvalued, or to reduce currency risk.
But many studies have shown that hedging equities may not be worth the cost. These currency strategies have tended to have a relatively small impact on a stock portfolio’s longer term volatility and return. This is different from bond portfolios, where currencies can be a more significant source of risk and return. In fixed income, currency hedging can be effective based on an investor’s views of currencies in specific markets.
At Capital Group, generally, each portfolio manager can choose to implement a hedging strategy for the equity assets they manage within an institutional strategy or mutual fund. Over the past five years, Capital Group’s international and global equity portfolios have typically had less than 5% of their assets hedged.
Bottom line 
Active management can help discern which companies could benefit from a strong dollar. This year’s massive currency moves are creating tailwinds for certain companies, and the repercussions of an appreciating dollar can vary widely. In our view, research is key to assessing the likely effects of currencies on a specific firm’s prospects and its stock’s return potential.

12,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/investing-ideas-farnborough-international-airshow.html,Investing ideas from the Farnborough International Airshow,Aerospace,"October 6, 2022","Witnessing an F-35 jet fighter take off vertically as it rapidly achieves speeds beyond the sound barrier and then swiftly returns to earth in a vertical descent is a stunning experience, according to equity portfolio manager Jason Smith.
“I have seen an F-35 take flight a few times,” says Smith, who attended a demonstration in July at the Farnborough International Airshow outside London. “It’s hard not to be awestruck every time.”
Smith, who covers European industrials, airlines, aerospace and defense companies as an analyst, didn’t attend the event simply for the spectacle. He and eight colleagues went to see the latest advancements in commercial aviation, meet with management teams and gain insights into the industry overall.
“Getting out on the road to kick the tires and meeting face-to-face with management are cornerstones of our research process,” says Lara Pellini, an equity portfolio manager based in London who accompanied Smith.
“During the pandemic we managed with virtual meetings, but Farnborough was a great opportunity to harvest and replenish relationships, and take the temperature of the commercial aircraft market,” she explains.
Here, Smith and Pellini identify six key insights from their trip to Farnborough.
1. There’s no substitute for being there
The aerospace and defense industry hosts shows all over the world, but the two most important are held in Farnborough and Paris in alternating years. At these events leading companies gather to meet with customers and investors, announce major business deals and showcase the latest technological advances. The 2022 event featured Airbus and Boeing, engine makers Safran and Rolls-Royce, and defense companies Lockheed Martin, Rheinmetall and BAE Systems — among others.
While much can be discovered by reading industry research, constructing models and learning about addressable markets, it is hard to fully understand whether a plane or helicopter lives up to the hype by watching a video on YouTube.
“There really is no substitute for being there,” says Pellini. “I may already have a point of view but traveling with our investment analysts to see the companies we might invest in, visiting their operations and interacting with management helps crystalize my thinking and provides a better frame of reference going forward.”
During the show, the portfolio managers and analysts boarded several aircraft, including an Airbus A400M military transport plane. They sat in the cockpit and toured the crew’s sleeping quarters in an A350-900 wide-body jet and had every feature of a H145 helicopter explained in detail.
Day three featured the F-35 demonstration. “When the jet took off, it blasted noise limits,” says Smith. “Before we departed, we also observed the amazing maneuverability of Boeing’s double rotor Chinook helicopter, which performed a series of twists, turns and steep climbs.”
Hands-on experiences can help investors get a better grasp of concepts like fuel efficiency, for example, and track the impact of innovation and disruption over time.
“Simply boarding the plane and witnessing how the cabin is optimized to keep it compact can give you a sense of how fuel efficient a plane might be,” Pellini says. “I also was struck by how much these companies have picked up from the gaming industry. In some new simulation machines, the pilot wears a helmet with a headset and sees only what is in the helmet, much like a virtual reality gaming system.”
2. Air travel is taking off again
In the case of this trip, the simple act of getting there offered anecdotal evidence about the health of global travel. Smith, who is based in New York, said his flight to London was full, the airport was packed and security delays were long. “Anyone who has been in a plane the last few months — and recent data suggests many have been — can appreciate that airfares have probably never been higher.”
This bodes well for the aerospace industry as well as the airlines. After two years of mostly empty skies and a COVID-related freeze on plane orders, the airlines are now scrambling to get planes delivered and replace others with newer, more fuel-efficient models. In fact, the world’s two major aircraft makers, Airbus and Boeing, have order backlogs totaling more than 10.5 years of production.
A long runway for commercial aircraft production
Sources: Capital Group, company reports. Boeing's last reported order backlog is over 4,200, while Airbus has an order backlog of 7,046 planes. As of June 30, 2022.
These numbers were supported by conversations and announcements at the air show. To be sure, the overall tone was somewhat subdued compared to pre-pandemic shows, says Pellini. At times temperatures reached 120 degrees Fahrenheit on the tarmac. Attendance was down and companies hosted fewer meetings. And while the announced orders were lighter than pre-COVID events, a few were significant.
Another key takeaway: “Many people told us they were surprised at how quickly corporate travel has rebounded,” says Smith. “With working from home more accepted or simply necessary, there were fears that we'd be down 20% or 30%. In some markets it’s returned to 2019 levels and in others it’s down only 10% to 15%. That suggests that Zoom fatigue has set in. People want to get out and travel.”
3. Certain companies may benefit from a defense “super-cycle”
One consistent insight that came out of nearly every conversation is that geopolitical tensions are growing, not just in Europe but across the globe. This, of course, has been in news headlines for some time. Indeed, Germany recently disclosed plans to spend 100 billion euros in the next four years on defense, its biggest shift in foreign policy since World War II. Japan indicated it would double its budget.
“Whether in the Pacific or Eastern Europe, a common theme is that the divide between the East and the West has resurfaced and is widening,” Pellini says. “The world is less safe. This is unfortunate, but it does present opportunity for defense contractors. With security now top of mind for politicians, voters and even some investors, I believe we may be at the start of a super-cycle for defense.”
But not all defense companies will benefit, explains Pellini. The key is to understand which specific companies have the most useful innovations, are well positioned to execute on their business plan and can overcome challenges like supply chain disruptions.
Global risks have grown

The Geopolitical Risk Index is a measure of adverse geopolitical events and associated risks based upon the tally of newspaper articles covering geopolitical tensions, using a sample of 10 newspapers going back to 1985. Index level values reflect a six-month smoothed average of monthly data. As of August 2022.
4. Face-to-face meetings sharpen the picture
Rising demand for air travel and higher defense spending are well known. What’s not as clear, though, are which companies are best positioned to take advantage of these secular trends. That’s why research trips like this one to Farnborough are so important to build a better understanding of business models, assess company operations and products, and determine whether a management team can execute.
According to Pellini CEOs and CFOs are more willing to share information and offer opinions about competitors when they are speaking directly with you. “It’s easier to ask tough questions and pick up nuances in their tone of voice, as well as non-verbal cues.”
“Once a manager is more relaxed, they often become more engaged and willing to be open about what keeps them up at night or what they’re excited about,” Smith adds.
“There were a number of candid conversations that we came away from with more certainty about the sincerity of a manager’s upbeat forecast or their reports about strengthening demand. This is something you can’t get from a Zoom encounter, and these conversations were very useful in confirming our investment theses.”
While meetings with CEOs and CFOs are important, sometimes the most compelling or useful insights can be gleaned from conversations with line managers and other executives. For example, during a Farnborough meeting, the executive vice president of an engine maker explained how key industry participants are aligning to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
“He really knew his stuff and presented it so well,” says Smith. The executive, whose background is in space and hydrogen, identified three levers his company can use to achieve new emissions standards: burn less fuel, burn better fuel and make everything lighter.
“We spent a lot of time talking about the innovation timelines required to make their target,” adds Smith. “The most fascinating part of the conversation was how this executive was able to explain the complexities of developing hydrogen into a safe, reliable and green fuel source to layman like me.”
5. The lightbulbs shine in the meeting after the meeting
The bus ride to and from Farnborough and the hotel in London took as much as 90 minutes to two hours depending on traffic. That often was when the light bulbs shined the brightest.
When nine people share a confined space for that much time, they can strategize for upcoming meetings. They might decide what key information they want to get from a particular meeting, key questions to be asked and who should do the asking.
“We used the bus ride back to the hotel as a debriefing period, where we discussed what we liked and didn't like,” says Smith. “The group shared differing perspectives on what they thought were the crucial takeaways. And between the nine of us, we came away with a broad spectrum of answers, views and concerns. So it really is a useful process — and one we've used for years.”

6. Research trips can lead to better investment decisions
Overall, the group came away from Farnborough feeling constructive about several companies in the aerospace and defense industry, even if major economies were to slip into recession in the coming year.
“The pandemic prompted the worst recession in the history of the commercial aircraft industry,” Pellini says. “Today the industry is recovering — and a number of tailwinds are supporting the recovery.”
Before COVID, passenger growth had been resilient to external shocks. In fact, over the last 50 years, the industry has been growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 5%. Airbus, for example, has at least 17 years of consistent aircraft deliveries. After delaying plane deliveries for two years, many airlines today are ordering planes five years out.
“I would argue that the pent-up demand for planes has never been stronger,” Pellini adds.
To be fair, consistent deliveries in past downturns did not prevent share prices from meaningfully falling. The industry faces other challenges, including supply chain constraints and a U.S. labor shortage that's hurting engine manufacturers, which in turn is impacting both Airbus and Boeing.
“Nevertheless, despite the muted tone at the air show, there was also a generally relaxed feeling,” Smith concludes. “Passengers are flying again, airlines are placing orders, and as long as supply chains can improve and companies can continue to meet demand, the outlook for the next three to five years appears positive.”

Stock markets around the world have entered bear territory. In the U.S., the S&P 500 Index has plummeted more than 23%, year to date, as of September 26, 2022. Today, many investors are focused on the likelihood of recession, rising rates and more pain ahead.
“No one knows when this decline will end, but I am confident it will end, so I encourage you not to get caught up in pessimism,” says equity portfolio manager Don O’Neal, who has 36 years of investment experience and has navigated several bear markets. “Declines create opportunities for investors who remain calm. If we make good decisions in times of stress, we can potentially set up the next several years for strong returns.”
The importance of experience
Source: Capital Group. As of 12/31/21.
In unnerving times like these, it’s helpful to hear from veterans like O’Neal who have survived numerous bear markets. At Capital Group, 31% of portfolio managers have more than 30 years of investment experience while 84% have 20 or more.
We asked O’Neal and four of his colleagues, each of whom has been investing for more than three decades and 171 years collectively, to share lessons learned from past bear markets and how they are applying those lessons today.
1. Avoid the winners of the last cycle
Lisa Thompson, Portfolio Manager, New World Fund®
33 years of investment experience
My experience has taught me that markets have long cycles. I believe the pandemic marked the end of the post-global financial crisis cycle — a cycle dominated by deleveraging, demand shocks and expanding globalization. These conditions led to looser monetary and fiscal policy, low cost of capital and stock price inflation.
Today we are at the beginning of a new cycle, one that I expect will be marked by deglobalization, a shrinking labor supply and decarbonization — conditions that will lead to a shift from asset price inflation to goods inflation. Profit margins and highly valued stocks will face continued pressure. Because I expect generally higher inflation during this period, I want to steer clear of many of the fast-growing primarily U.S. companies that were the winners of the previous cycle.
Market leadership often changes after a bear market
Sources: Capital Group, MSCI, Refinitiv Datastream. Returns shown are from the MSCI USA Index and are absolute total returns in U.S. dollars. For the tech bubble the dates represented are December 31, 1996, to March 31, 2000 (before bear market), and September 30, 2002, to December 30, 2005 (after bear market). For the global financial crisis the dates represented are December 31, 2003, to September 28, 2007 (before bear market), and March 31, 2009, to December 31, 2013 (after bear market).
When cycles shift, market leadership changes. So, in today’s rising rate environment, I am focused on opportunities to invest in lower priced companies that generate strong cash flow. I think of this theme as the Revenge of the Nerds. I am generally staying away from the cool kids of the last decade — glitzy tech and media companies — and looking for opportunities among the unpopular kids in those industries hurt by the low cost of capital, poor capital allocation and adverse regulations. Some examples here might include leading telecom companies in markets like Europe, Mexico and Japan.
In fact, I am focusing largely on companies outside the U.S. In my view, many U.S. companies have benefited more from globalization and the low cost of capital than similar companies in other markets.
Given recent fears of deglobalization and rising inflation, I am looking at companies in Europe and Japan, as well as emerging markets that I have covered for decades. This might include, for example, commercial banks and consumer staples in China, but also in Italy, France, Japan and Latin America.
2. Separate the wheat from the chaff
Don O’Neal, Principal Investment Officer, The Growth Fund of America®
36 years of investment experience
First, it’s important to recognize that things have changed. What used to work for stock picking won’t work in the same way, possibly for years. Holding the best companies with the best growth stories seemed to be a good approach over the past 10 years.
But I believe the last decade was too easy. Whenever retail investors get hyped up and day traders abound via Robinhood, that is a sign.
Going forward it will likely be harder to generate good returns, and the factors that drive returns most likely will change. For example, you can no longer buy and hold the fastest growers without regard to profits. I see this as a welcome return to fundamentals.
You may hear the current decline described as a correction of high multiple growth stocks. While this is generally true, it is incomplete. The stocks that have fallen the most all had fundamentals that disappointed versus expectations. Stocks with continued good fundamentals have held up better.
A lot of stocks have plummeted, but that doesn’t mean they are all bad investments. Consider this example: In the 2000 bear market, both Amazon and Pets.com declined more than 80%. Pets.com went on to become a poster child for irrational exuberance as its stock went to zero. Meanwhile Amazon went on to become …. Amazon.
Bear markets can inflict pain indiscriminately
Source: FactSet. Full chart shows monthly returns from 1/31/00–6/30/22. Smaller chart shows daily returns from 1/3/00–12/31/00.
For me, it’s time to get out a clean sheet of paper, focus on the fundamentals and concentrate your portfolio. Ruthlessly throw out the pretenders and hold only the highest conviction investments. Separate the wheat from the chaff.
For the next few years, the best strategy is not likely to be focused simply on finding growth. Instead, the balance of good fundamentals at a good price should prevail. Look for a diversified mix of companies. This could include companies in the semiconductor, cloud services or search areas, for example. But it could also lead to more value-oriented companies like defense contractors, insurers or energy companies.
3. Trade the intangible for the tangible
Carl Kawaja, Principal Investment Officer, EuroPacific Growth Fund®
35 years of investment experience
For the last 10 years the stock market placed a lot of value on companies that offer intangible things like software. But we've recently seen it demonstrate a greater embrace of companies that make tangible things. We all know and appreciate how rapidly electric vehicles are growing, but I think people may have underappreciated how much nickel and copper are needed to build their batteries.
That’s why demand for some commodities, like nickel, is benefiting from secular tailwinds, and markets are starting to recognize this. Of course, to succeed in a commodity investment, you need to identify a company that has an enduring resource or a cost-effective means of finding and producing more of it.
Consider iron ore, a key ingredient in steel. One of the reasons it has been important since the Iron Age — that’s a long time — is that we haven't really found another material that replaces it in terms of strength, cost, weight, flexibility and ability to be molded and transported. This substance underpins so much of the world’s progress. Skyscrapers are not made of brick or wood or some New Age material. They are built of steel. There's also a lot of steel in the computer I use. And most people probably drive to work in a car built with steel.
Iron ore can be found throughout the world, so in theory a lot of people could produce steel. But there really are only two places where it can be mined economically — Brazil and Australia — because it needs to be mined in pure quantities.
Brazil is home to a unique source of high-quality iron. When iron is mined it is often dropped directly into containers that are covered with blankets because it's so fine it can blow away in the wind, like baby powder. This makes Brazilian iron ore particularly good for blending with other grades because it lowers the cost of producing the ore in a blast furnace to make steel. It also increases the strength of the steel, so that high-quality iron ore generates a premium.
You can't invent that somewhere else. I’m not worried about Silicon Valley disrupting iron ore or some brilliant scientists in Switzerland discovering a different way to produce it. The market moves in cycles, so it will fall in and out of favor, but I feel reasonably confident that 50 years from now, production of iron ore will remain important.
4. Ride supertankers, limit moonshots
Jody Jonsson, Principal Investment Officer, New Perspective Fund®
33 years of investment experience
One observation over my career is that when there are regime shifts in the market, the stocks that represent the former leadership can take a long time to recover. Rotation away from the dominant companies can go on much longer than you think it can or should.
In the late 1990s-early 2000s period, some of the largest tech stocks went down 80% or more and stayed down for five to 10 years. And these were the strong companies that survived; many others went to zero. You needed a very strong stomach to hold on through this period. It took almost a decade for tech to regain market leadership again. Financial stocks behaved similarly after the financial crisis in 2008 — out of favor for another decade. In periods like these, you must consider that something has changed beyond just the valuation for these former leaders. Usually, the valuation corrects first and the fundamentals follow.
So how am I thinking about investing in today’s environment? I believe that we are experiencing “climate change” in the market, not just a passing storm. We need to avoid anchoring on past growth rates, profit margins or stock prices. Given the high level of uncertainty, I focus primarily on “supertankers” — dominant companies in their industries that generate solid cash flow, have strong competitive moats and can fund their own growth. I am investing more sparingly in what I would call “moonshots” — higher risk, higher reward companies that are more volatile — because in a rising interest rate environment, investors are less forgiving on valuations for more speculative companies.
I try to hold companies with reasonable, understandable valuations on near-term earnings and cash flows. Some examples include leading managed care providers or device makers in the health care sector, or nonbank financials such as insurers and exchanges that can benefit from rising interest rates and elevated trading volumes and are not overly sensitive to the economy.
5. Bear markets can be your friend
Steve Watson, Principal Investment Officer, International Growth and Income FundSM
34 years of investment experience
Over my career I have experienced 21 market shocks, including the collapse of the Soviet Union, the bursting of the technology bubble, the global financial crisis and now COVID-19. I mention these events only to highlight the fact that market disruptions are a fact of life. It’s just a matter of time before the train goes off the rails. My list suggests it happens every 18 months or so.
Market disturbances are a fact of life for investors
Sources: MSCI, RIMES. As of 6/30/22. Data is indexed to 100 on 1/1/87, based on the MSCI World Index from 1/1/87–12/31/87, the MSCI ACWI with gross returns from 1/1/88–12/31/00, and the MSCI ACWI with net returns thereafter. Shown on a logarithmic scale.
As long as I’ve been in this business, I’ve seen the market swing from excessive enthusiasm to extreme pessimism. An investor with a reasonable degree of objectivity can benefit from selling the former and buying the latter. It’s an approach that frequently causes pain and tends to pay off mostly during the early stages of market upturns, as pessimism gives way to optimism. Warren Buffett said it best: Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful. Put another way, bear markets are an investor’s friend, provided they remain calm, patient and focus on the long term.
I like to purchase shares when they are down and out, but I also like to hang on long enough to let the market catch up with what I think is the true value of the company in question. Despite my value bent, I remain a strong believer in the resilience of the tech sector. Entry point is important to me. Therefore, I will look to invest in some select tech companies when their shares are beaten down.
What’s more, I have long placed an emphasis on dividends as the primary way that a company transfers value to its investors. In my view, the potential for dividend payers to provide relative stability during market turbulence is more important than ever. And I continue to hold several high dividend payers, as well as dividend growers. The shares I invest in, like my own children, should pay rent to live with me.
Bottom line
Today, there are thoughtful, experienced economists and professional investors who can give you well-reasoned arguments why this bear market is different, why the economic problems are different and why this time things may get worse. But while some others might tell you, “This time is different,” our message to you is, “we’ve seen this before.”
“I don’t know if the current decline will fit into the pantheon of bear markets past,” O’Neal says. “But what I do know is that every bear period has eventually ended, and the market started back up again.”
Over time, and in time, the financial markets have demonstrated a remarkable ability to anticipate a better tomorrow even when today’s news feels so bad. While no one can predict the future and no two market declines are the same, we have been here before, and we’ve learned how to survive and prosper when markets begin to recover.

14,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/supply-chains-reglobalization.html,Supply chain shifts signal reglobalization,Trade,"August 23, 2022","The fragility of global supply chains exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic remains one of the top economic challenges facing the world. In one respect, globalization has long been characterized by developed market countries offshoring production to lower cost locations. But now, companies are recognizing the need to build redundancies into their supply lines, which will have varied impacts on countries, companies and industries.
While some have argued this could lead to a less globalized world or “deglobalization,” this could be the start of an era of “reglobalization,"" in which supply chains are reorganized and more countries are brought into global trade networks. 
“I would expect most companies with a significant percentage of their manufacturing base in Greater China (including Taiwan) to diversify to other countries,” says Noriko Chen, a Capital Group equity portfolio manager with New Perspective Fund®. “The reinvestment in some countries is likely to be positive. But it will also come at a cost to profitability for some companies. However, this should lead to new investing opportunities for those who can identify companies that will benefit from changes in global trade patterns.”
Global trade has slowed but is still growing
Sources: International Monetary Fund, Refinitiv Datastream. As of December 31, 2021.
Supply chains are shifting but not deglobalizing
Many companies are shifting their areas of manufacturing operations to multiple centers across the globe to disperse risk. That does not necessarily mean this could result in less economic integration. Consider Taiwan-based TSMC, the world’s dominant manufacturer of cutting-edge semiconductors. After having concentrated the bulk of its capacity in Taiwan — a focal point of geopolitical tensions — TSMC is building its first manufacturing hub in the United States. It’s also constructing a new semiconductor plant in Japan.
Multinationals with a significant presence in China are also looking for that next big opportunity to reach consumers outside of China. Apple, which has arguably built the most impressive supply chain of any multinational in China, moved some iPhone production to India, which is forecast to have an estimated 1 billion smartphone users by 2026.
There are also Chinese companies seeking to forge closer trade links with their customers outside of China. Chinese electric vehicle (EV) battery maker CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co.) recently received approval to build a battery cell plant in Germany, where it works with the top German automakers.
Diversification from China will take time
For those companies reducing their dependence on China, the diversification from China’s supply chain will take time. China is likely to remain significant due to a lack of viable alternatives and because more goods made in China will increasingly target Chinese consumers in the future.
“A common phrase I hear from companies is ‘China Plus,’” says Ben Lin, an investment analyst at Capital Group. “This means manufacturers will retain their existing China factory, but will gradually add production capacities outside of China and slowly build up the domestic supply chain in those countries. This could take at least several years or even a decade before they can replace Chinese suppliers.” 
China's export sector dwarfs Southeast Asian rivals
Sources: Capital Group, Refinitiv Datastream. As of December 31, 2021. Values are not adjusted for inflation.
For now, China remains one of the world’s top destinations for foreign direct investment flows, which reflect companies buying, building or reinvesting in operations abroad. In 2021, China ranked second behind the U.S., with $334 billion of flows, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Multinationals still see value in tapping into China’s large and skilled workforce. A case in point is Tesla. China has become a key production hub for the dominant EV maker. Tesla opened its Shanghai gigafactory in 2019 to help boost its annual car production and increase its global market share by selling to the world’s top consumer of EVs.
Another area is health care. Pharmaceutical giants such as AstraZeneca and Pfizer have built strong relationships with domestic Chinese biopharmaceutical companies to help develop and test new drugs. Clinical trials account for approximately 90% of the cost of developing a drug for global use, and labor costs for clinical trials are cheaper in China compared with the U.S., Germany and Switzerland, according to Capital Group analysts who cover the health care sector. 
China has moved up the manufacturing value chain

Building security and redundancy in supply chains
The global supply chain has been under unprecedented stress, from the U.S.-China trade war to the COVID-19 pandemic to the war in Ukraine. If any industry has felt the brunt of the supply chain snarls, it’s been the auto business.
General Motors, Ford, Stellantis and other global automakers have faced steep production cuts, resulting in a scarcity of vehicles on dealer lots and a sharp increase in the prices of new and used cars. This is leading to structural changes within the auto industry, which has had to entirely rethink its supply chains. 
One outcome has been a move away from receiving “just-in-time” inventory to holding “just-in-case” inventory when it comes to semiconductors.
Building redundancies in supply chains will come with opportunities and challenges. Certain industries will be beneficiaries, ranging from those supplying semiconductor equipment and industrial components to automation tools and physical metals.
“I anticipate reshoring to be a major growth driver for select industrial companies over the next five to 10 years,” says Capital Group equity investment analyst Gigi Pardasani. “Many U.S. industrials are investing at levels we have not seen since the early 2000s to better position themselves to meet this demand.”
In the near term, there will be financial costs and potential ramifications of supply chain shifts, such as:
Greater levels of corporate spending and higher operating costs. For Western companies moving production back to their home markets, or for Asian companies expanding their footprint into the West, the costs will be higher than running factories solely in China or other Asian countries. Companies are likely to either pay for more expensive automation equipment or higher wages for workers.
Higher costs for consumers. Inflation is already running at a 40-year high in the U.S. as higher prices ripple through global supply chains. Higher costs for companies to build more inventories or reshore manufacturing are likely to translate into higher prices for consumers. Companies will absorb some, but not all, of the costs, which could weigh on consumer demand for their products.
Higher working capital needs and operating margin pressure due to costs associated with building redundancy and flexibility in supply chains. These factors could weigh on future margins and valuations for companies. Lower returns on invested capital may be here to stay as a result of a change in the geopolitical landscape and central banks’ rate policies.
“Companies and businesses with pricing power or economies of scale may benefit from this environment, but those without these advantages may face profit margin and earnings pressure and potentially lower valuation multiples,” says Kent Chan, an equity investment director at Capital Group.
However, he adds, there’s the possibility that “those companies that are able to diversify sourcing and build greater security and resilience in their supply chain may be rewarded with a higher valuation longer term, in spite of the costs.” 
Opportunities from global shifts in production
Looking at modern history, this is not the first time the global supply chain has been realigned.
In the early 1990s, Hong Kong was a hub for textiles, and Taiwan was a large manufacturer of sneakers. That gradually changed when China set up special economic zones, luring manufacturers with a more affordable option.
“Not only did these shifts in the supply chain not harm the economies of Hong Kong and Taiwan, but rather created room for the evolution of their respective economies,” recalls Chan, who worked in Hong Kong in the 1990s. “Over time, Hong Kong overtook Tokyo to become Asia’s leading financial services hub, and Taiwan moved up the value curve to become the world’s dominant manufacturer of semiconductors.” 
This is a reminder that, despite worries around supply shortages, fears of deglobalization and the expected shift in global supply chains, new opportunities could emerge in the regions where production is shifting, as well as in those countries where production is leaving.

Equity portfolio manager Caroline Randall keeps a close watch over dividend payers, but she’s especially interested in dividend growers.
“I’m very focused on companies with strong underlying earnings growth that have demonstrated a commitment to raise dividends over time,” Randall says. “Increasing dividend payouts can be seen as a signal of management’s confidence in future earnings growth.”
But can past earnings growth suggest solid return potential for investors? Consider the following hypothetical illustration.

Sources: Capital Group, Refinitiv Eikon, Refinitiv Datastream. Growth rate calculations for value of shares from reinvested dividends and dividends paid use the first year’s dividends payment ($797) as a starting value. This information should not be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell a particular security and is provided for illustrative purposes only. As of December 31, 2021.
The chart breaks down the year-end results of the hypothetical investment into five-year increments. Looking at Nestlé, that initial $100,000 would have grown to $694,518 by 2021.
“Dividend growers historically have tended to generate greater returns than other dividend strategies, while also keeping up with the broader market,” Randall adds.
The key to those strong returns is in the reinvestment of dividends. In the case of Nestlé, reinvested dividends would have generated 36% of the total investment value, or $248,301, over 20 years. McDonald’s and Samsung tell a similar story.
Of course, not all dividend-paying companies have kept pace with the broader market, and past results aren’t predictive of future outcomes. But the illustration suggests that dividend growers may be a good option for long-term investors.

18,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/3-ways-prepare-down-markets.html,3 ways to prepare for down markets,Portfolio Construction,"July 20, 2022","Risk management is critical to portfolio construction, as this year’s choppy markets have highlighted.
Some investors may think the best way to offset market volatility is with significant portfolio changes. But we’ve found that aggressive short-term moves, whether “buying the dip” of beaten down investments or shifting to very conservative holdings to ride out a market storm, often lead to even more unintended risks.
Equities are typically the riskiest part of a portfolio, but not all equity funds are created equal. To find out which strategies can help you weather down markets, we’ve examined results for virtually every equity mutual fund since 1934. Our research identified common traits of resilient funds, some of which can help manage risk, enhance outcomes and more closely align funds with clients’ objectives.
Here are three ways to help prepare your portfolio for down markets:
1. Look for a history of downside resilience
Despite evidence that market timing doesn’t work, investors still want to protect their assets. “Loss aversion,” the behavioral finance concept that claims investors dislike losses twice as much as they appreciate gains, helps explain this mindset. Partly responsible for Daniel Kahneman’s 2002 Nobel Prize, it is also a fancy way of saying investors hate to lose money.
This year’s market volatility has renewed interest in finding ways to mitigate portfolio losses. But what’s the best way to achieve this?
Our study revealed that downside capture — a measure of a fund’s results relative to a benchmark in negative market periods — has been an indicator of potential success in future downturns. Notably, funds with low downside capture ratios in the previous three years outpaced their peers in future corrections and bear markets in 12 of the 13 periods since 1973. 
Funds with strong downside capture ratios typically outpaced peers in future downturns
Sources: Capital Group, Morningstar, Standard & Poor's. Funds were grouped into downside capture ratio quartiles based on three-year downside capture ratios in the month prior to the start of a market correction (S&P 500 decline of 10% or more). Returns shown in the chart are the relative returns of the best down capture quartile minus the returns for the worst down capture quartile during the next market correction. Funds include those from the Morningstar Open-End Large Growth, Large Value and Large Blend categories. All data reflect month-end dates. As of 6/30/22, the current market correction is still ongoing and is not included in the analysis.
2. Optimize your portfolio with all-weather investments
Downside protection may be some investors’ top objective, but for most it likely isn’t enough. After all, cash will offer a measure of protection in the next downturn — albeit with virtually no upside during a market recovery.
What many investors want is downside protection that also participates in market upside — an “all-weather” portfolio. A more technical term for this would be positive asymmetric risk and returns, which is an investment opportunity that’s favorably unbalanced toward the upside. This could mean the potential profit is higher than potential loss, or the probability of a gain is higher than the probability of a similar-sized loss.
We’ve identified three traits most common among funds that have exhibited strong outcomes across full cycles:
Active — By definition, a passive fund’s primary goal is to replicate a chosen index’s returns, including 100% upside and 100% downside capture. In contrast, active funds can seek to manage risk through security selection, though they may lag the index. Active management can also incorporate secondary client objectives, such as income or capital preservation, in addition to growth. We found that some of the most successful managers were those that incorporated multiple client objectives into the fund prospectus and strategy.
Flexible — Funds that incorporated some flexibility versus traditional style box metrics on size, style or geography had a larger set of stocks to choose from and could optimize based on market conditions. A flexible fund that shifts between the full universe of growth and value stocks has the potential for better outcomes than making a timing bet and aggressively buying or selling assets.
High yielding — These funds often had higher dividend yields than peers. In an analysis of monthly returns since 1993, funds with the best downside resilience (an average down capture ratio of 85%) had a higher dividend yield than their peers in all periods measured. There was a notable decrease in downside protection with lower yielding funds.
Higher dividend yields have contributed to better downside resilience

The asymmetry of gains and losses over time can be quite powerful. Managers who deliver on this trait can achieve a few potential benefits: 1) higher returns, as smaller losses allow for quicker compounding in the next leg up in the cycle; 2) lower volatility, as the highest peaks and deepest valleys are somewhat truncated; and 3) more patient clients, who are likely to stay the course through future market cycles. 
3. Consider funds with high overall capture ratios
One way to assess asymmetric risk is to examine an investment’s overall capture ratio — a measure that divides upside capture by downside capture.
There are many funds that may have slightly lagged the benchmark in extended positive periods, but their strong avoidance of loss in negative periods has offered an asymmetric advantage.
The pursuit of downside resilience is built into Capital Group’s long-term focus and investment philosophy. Over the last 30 years, every fund in our equity lineup with at least a 30-year history has had an overall capture ratio of over 100% — meaning its upside capture ratio has been higher than its downside capture ratio. Additionally, during this period, each of these funds has also achieved lower downside capture than the market. Evaluating the full spectrum of funds across this risk dimension allows investors to choose a more appropriate fund for their investment objectives.
Capital Group’s equity funds have had positive overall capture ratios
Sources: Capital Group, Morningstar. As of 12/31/21. The shaded blue area represents an overall capture ratio over 100% (which occurs when upside capture ratio is above downside capture ratio). Funds without a 30-year history were excluded from analysis. Please see disclosures below for full names of the funds and benchmarks used to calculate the capture ratios included in the chart.
For example, Washington Mutual Investors FundSM has an upside capture of 88% and a downside capture ratio of 79% over the last 30 years. For investors who use separately managed accounts in their portfolios, Capital Group U.S. Income and GrowthSM SMA is a strategy that also emphasizes downside resilience. This type of asymmetry can add value over a full market cycle and give investors more confidence to avoid bad timing decisions.
By examining the risk-return frontier, objective-based strategies such as these can help fine-tune risk and the amount of potential downside protection. Taken together, these characteristics may offer exactly what most clients are looking for: reasonable participation in market upsides combined with lower downside capture potential in inevitable market declines.

Risk
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. Small-company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The market indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.
In the overall capture ratio chart, the S&P 500 Index was used as the comparative benchmark for capture ratio calculations for the following funds: AMCAP Fund® (AMCAP), American Mutual Fund® (AMF), The Growth Fund of America® (GFA), Fundamental Investors® (FI), The Investment Company of America® (ICA), Washington Mutual Investors FundSM (WMIF). MSCI ACWI was used for the following funds: The New Economy Fund® (NEF), New Perspective Fund® (NPF). MSCI ACWI ex USA was used for EuroPacific Growth Fund® (EUPAC). MSCI ACWI Small Cap was used for SMALLCAP World Fund® (SCWF). 70% MSCI ACWI/30% Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index blend was used for Capital Income Builder® (CIB). 65% S&P 500/35% Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index blend was used for The Income Fund of America® (IFA). 60% S&P 500/40% Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index blend was used for American Balanced Fund® (AMBAL).
Up (down) capture ratio is the ratio of a fund’s return during periods when the index was up (down), divided by the return of the index during those periods. For example, an up-capture ratio greater than 100 indicates the fund produced a higher return than the index during periods when the index was up. Conversely, during periods when the index was down, a down-capture ratio greater than 100 indicates the fund produced a lower return than the index.

19,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/investing-in-china-today.html,How to think about investing in China today,China,"May 17, 2022","It’s important to state up front that we don’t believe China is “un-investible” as some have posited following the government’s recent intervention into several areas of the private-sector economy. It’s also not a geopolitical pariah like Russia, which is a tiny constituent of the global indexes and economy.
China’s key attraction is its enormous domestic market. But as the world’s second-largest economy, China is deeply interconnected with the global economy in manufacturing supply chains and is increasingly a large portion of multinational corporate revenues. Understanding and navigating the complexities of China has important implications for both domestic and international investing in understanding the development of its capital markets longer term.
The framework for investing in China has changed significantly over the past year due to micro, macro, regulatory and geopolitical factors. China is still investible, but at the right price in the right sectors. And the kinds of companies that might be future potential sources of solid returns could be quite different than in the past decade.
With that backdrop in mind, here is how we are thinking about investing in China today.
The risk premium is higher
We’ve been significantly reassessing the risk premium applied to China, given slower economic growth, the rising demographic headwinds and the potential for further regulatory measures. The country is going through a structural change during a cyclical downturn, and it could take some time to fully understand the impact of the government’s common prosperity agenda for the economy and President Xi Jinping’s priorities if he secures a third term.
So, what do we know? From our perspective, China’s problems are fairly apparent: among them, an aging population, significant debt at state-owned enterprises and local governments, pollution, wealth disparity and inefficient allocation of capital. The property sector and its current downturn are of particular concern.
Xi is trying to fix many of these critical problems with reforms and regulations. And since China’s two-term limit on the presidency was removed in 2018, Xi is widely expected to be elected for a third term at the 20th Party Congress in late 2022, giving him more time to implement his agenda and shape China for decades to come.
Explosive growth has transformed China over 40 years

For now, it means companies with excessively high profit margins may come under scrutiny, similar to what happened in the for-profit education and technology-related sectors. It also means incorporating a much more layered and complex analysis of each security from a fundamental perspective and through a policy lens to see where it fits in Beijing’s development agenda. An example would be companies that are beneficiaries aligned with Xi’s mandate to source locally and develop internal domestic supply chains.
It further means applying a higher risk premium to Chinese equities with comparable businesses to listed stocks in other countries that don’t have the same political risks. Emerging internet platform companies in Southeast Asia and Latin America are an example.
Over the past 18 months, we’ve become more selective and have narrowed exposure in China. Holdings have become increasingly concentrated in fewer larger positions and in companies run by private entrepreneurs, where there remains potential for secular growth with some political tailwinds.
And we’ve become more valuation sensitive and focused on capital allocation. This has meant a reduction in technology holdings and China exposure overall. As the chart shows, China’s technology companies have tumbled since early 2021, not long after China’s regulators abruptly postponed the initial public offering of Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial.
Value of China’s technology giants has diminished on regulatory uncertainties
Sources: Capital Group, MSCI, RIMES. The five companies included represent the five largest Chinese technology companies (Tencent, Alibaba, JD.com, Baidu and NetEase) by market value as of February 28, 2022, that were also publicly listed in 2015. All stocks, except Tencent, reflect their American Depository Receipts.
A focus on domestic companies with less political risk
Finding areas to invest alongside the priorities of China’s government has taken on even greater importance. The government seems determined to not let private companies have a disproportionate influence on any single area of the economy or to reap high profits at the expense of consumers, although they want them to remain innovative and source materials domestically.
It seems the playbooks for the large internet platform companies has changed and their days of exponential growth will be more measured. To some degree, this is now reflected in their stock prices. It’s become clear the government wants to prevent the large technology companies from aggressively expanding horizontally into multiple lines of business. It also seems clear the government wants to protect their smaller competitors and to force a more equitable distribution of wealth.
On top of this, several key areas, like e-commerce, may be maturing in terms of penetration and have become increasingly competitive. Based on reports of layoffs and bonus cuts in China’s internet sector, it appears these companies are preparing for a different future.
In our view, political investment risk may be reduced by focusing on domestic-oriented companies in China that are aligned with Xi’s policy priorities (i.e., automation, local technology and content, environment, electric vehicles (EVs), health care) and serve to improve people’s lives at reasonable prices and margins.
Over the years, we’ve met many smart entrepreneurs in China who have scaled up their businesses very quickly and believe such investment opportunities remain in the country’s large addressable markets, in areas like consumer products, health care, IT services, semiconductors and clean energy. So, from our perspective, it is possible to enjoy a long tailwind of growth if you pick the right place to invest.
China seeks to become self-sufficient in key industries
Sources: U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Center for Security and Emerging Technology, based on estimated data as of 2017.
Potential areas of growth alongside Beijing's agenda
One area of interest is auto dealerships, which are building their brands within China. It’s a basic business but still largely fragmented across China with room to grow, especially in after-sales service. EVs and urban natural gas networks that replace coal are attractive areas that are aligned with the government’s agenda. And, given the aging population, automation and health care remain areas with long-term tailwinds. Other areas of potential growth are national consumer brands in the alcohol and dairy space, which are gaining share and have pricing power.
Given the sheer size of the population, domestic consumer brands don’t necessarily have to target consumers outside China to become successful. Many Chinese consumers are buying their first homes, refrigerators and other household appliances to improve their living standards, and the middle class continues to grow and remains aspirational. This approach also helps shield some investments from getting swept up in U.S.–China trade frictions.

Expect a slower rate of growth in China’s economy
There is a risk of a prolonged slump in China’s economy. China is dealing with another round of rolling COVID-19 lockdowns (which are more stringent than those in 2020), and this could further constrain already weak consumer spending and a broader reopening of China’s economy. This also may continue to impact global supply chains and increase global inflationary pressures.
The property market, which is a significant contributor to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), is in a significant downturn with many heavily indebted real estate developers. Land and home sales have been weak, and there does not seem to be much incentive for buyers to fork over down payments on projects that might not get finished.
Our economist colleague Stephen Green is concerned about the prospects for China’s economy over the next 12 months. He anticipates marginal growth and does not expect any significant loosening of policy that would forestall the current slowdown. He believes Beijing, which has guided to 5.5% GDP growth in 2022, has not moved fast enough to turn around the economy.
There are likely to be a few interest rate cuts and tax cuts for small businesses, but no big bang measures like those that pulled China out of its 2015–16 slump. At best, in Green’s estimation, Beijing will slowly turn up the stimulus dial each month.
Valuations for leading domestic consumer companies have been less affected
Source: Refinitiv Datastream. Data as of February 28, 2022. Forward price-to-earnings is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its projected per share earnings over the next 12 months.
Historically, volatility in China has been a buying opportunity: The problem appears, growth slows, the government comes up with clever tweaks to regulation and policy with more stimulus, the economy stabilizes and the market rebounds. But it seems the playbook has changed, and many of us are waiting to see if more significant stimulus measures happen after the 20th Party Congress.
The energy shortages that rippled through China in the fall of 2021 and temporarily shut down manufacturing facilities were telling about Xi’s resolve to restructure the economy. Why would Xi allow this when the economy was weak, the property market was rapidly decelerating, there was a trade war with the United States and COVID was impacting global export markets?
The message is clear, in our view: GDP growth is no longer a top priority for China’s Communist Party. We are bracing for more volatility and plan to be more selective about gauging the risk premium for industries and companies. But we continue to look for longer term opportunities amid this market selloff.

20,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/air-travel-taking-off.html,Air travel is taking off again,Aerospace,"May 11, 2022","After two years of relatively empty skies, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary is an eyewitness to the incredible resurgence of demand for air travel. Faced with long security delays at Dublin Airport, he implored the Irish government to call up the army last month to help process eager travelers flooding the terminals.
As the global economy gradually emerges from the pandemic, airports around the world are dealing with a crush of passengers looking to make up for lost time. Fueled by pent-up demand, many are flying for the first time since the COVID-19 virus crippled the travel industry. For the airlines, the turnaround in demand has been fast and furious, surpassing even the most optimistic expectations.
“Demand is turning back on almost as quickly as it turned off,” says Capital Group equity analyst Todd Saligman, who covers the aerospace industry in the U.S. and Europe. “Many U.S. airlines have reported that March was the strongest booking month in history, and we are seeing similar strength in Europe.”
U.S. air travel is rebounding from a sharp pandemic-era downturn
Sources: Capital Group, U.S. Transportation Security Administration. Data reflects number of travelers going through TSA airport checkpoints. As of 4/30/22.
Heading into the summer vacation season, air travel is likely to exceed pre-COVID levels in much of the Western world. That’s despite several headwinds facing the airlines today, including sharply higher fuel costs, a pilot shortage and fewer available flights as the industry ramps up to full strength. A resurgence of the virus is holding back China’s reopening, leaving Asian air travel lagging the U.S. and Europe at the moment.
“We’re not back to pre-COVID levels yet, but it’s just a matter of time,” Saligman notes. “Travel is a secular growth industry in a lot of countries. Only about 20% of the world’s population has ever been on an airplane. So there is huge room for growth, especially in emerging markets such as China and India, where the middle class is growing and air travel is still in its infancy.”

Volatility is in the air
Make no mistake, airline stocks are volatile. As a group, U.S. airline stocks fell 31% in 2020 as government-imposed lockdowns and bans on international travel brought air traffic to a virtual standstill. They fell another 2% in 2021, even as a reawakening economy lifted other sectors. It’s been a mixed bag so far this year, with the sector up nearly 10%, despite a pullback after Russia’s February 24 invasion of Ukraine.
The war has contributed to a meteoric rise in the price of jet fuel, which has increased 110% this year, surpassing the rise in oil prices by a wide margin. Fuel is generally the second largest expense for airlines, after labor.
Jet fuel costs are rising even faster than oil prices
Sources: Capital Group, Refinitiv Datastream. Jet fuel prices represented by the U.S. Gulf Coast Kerosene-Type Jet Spot Price; Brent crude prices represented by the Europe Brent Spot Price. As of 4/30/2022.
In normal times, such a dramatic increase in jet fuel prices would hurt the highly competitive aviation industry. But these aren’t normal times.
“Airlines have largely been able to pass these costs along in the form of higher airfares,” Saligman explains. “These stocks will likely continue to be volatile, but I think the next six to 12 months could be a very strong period for the airlines, as well as cruise lines and other travel-related companies.”
Indeed, two of the largest U.S. carriers — American Airlines and Delta Airlines — are both forecasting record-high revenues in the current quarter ending June 30. In recent earnings calls, airline executives said they expect sales to soar during the summer travel season. “Demand is stronger than I’ve ever seen in my career,” said United CEO Scott Kirby, “and that’s even before business travel fully recovers.”
Airline industry poised for rapid growth in a post-pandemic world
Sources: Capital Group, MSCI, Refinitiv Datastream, RIMES. As of 4/30/22.
Come fly with me
Optimism for the airline industry comes with a few caveats. The recovery should proceed if energy prices don’t continue to skyrocket, the Russia-Ukraine conflict doesn’t spread and severe COVID restrictions aren’t once again imposed. Those are some big assumptions that may or may not play out according to plan. But over the long term, the outlook is favorable, says Steve Watson, a portfolio manager with New Perspective Fund®. 
“I think COVID will go away, and people will want to fly again — it’s that simple,” says Watson, who holds airlines, cruise lines and booking companies in his portfolios. “Investors should focus less on the timing and more on what cash flows and earnings will look like in the months and years ahead.”
What about the fear that Zoom or Webex video calls will replace the need for in-person business meetings? That’s nonsense, Watson says.
“Years ago, conference calls were supposed to kill business travel and that never really happened either,” he notes. “People who generate revenue face-to-face will be traveling.”
Long runway for “reopening” theme
As one of the few industries that has not fully participated in the COVID recovery period, many airlines are attractive from a valuation perspective, says Chris Thomsen, a portfolio manager with the EuroPacific Growth Fund®.
Airlines have experienced a delayed recovery, largely due to the emergence of the COVID-19 omicron variant last December. With omicron fading in many parts of the world, airlines and other travel-related companies are well positioned to participate in the comeback that has lifted other sectors hard hit by the 2020 downturn.
Thomsen saw evidence of that on a recent trip from London to Los Angeles.
“The airports were crowded, restaurants were bustling and flights were full,” he says. “I think we are in a post-COVID world now. People want to get out and do all the things they couldn’t over the past two years. That’s going to benefit the travel industry for the next few years at least.”

Railroads are riding a commodities boom
You can’t build the new economy without old industries.
Long-term shifts toward a digital future, the rollout of electric vehicles and the transition to clean energy will likely continue to drive opportunity for innovators in those areas. But these trends are also providing tailwinds for old industries like mining and railroads.
Nickel, for example, is a key component in electric vehicle batteries. So is copper, which is necessary for updating the electric grid. And while software is becoming an increasingly essential player in the production of modern cars, steel remains a required component. Indeed, prices for select commodities have skyrocketed in recent months, a trend amplified by the war between Russia and Ukraine — major producers of nickel, copper and grains.
“People have underappreciated how much copper is needed to rewire and modernize the electric grid as demand rises,” says equity portfolio manager Andrew Suzman. “Businesses like Canadian metals and mining company First Quantum Minerals, which focuses on copper, and Brazil’s Vale, a producer of iron ore, could benefit.”
Rising demand for commodities and energy could also boost demand for North America’s railroads, which are the most cost-effective way to transport heavy materials. Railroads have pricing power potential as well, which is important in today’s inflationary environment. They typically base their pricing on the cost of the underlying commodities they are hauling, so revenues rise with commodity prices.
Rising fuel costs also prove beneficial, as the difference between the cost of trucking and rails is at its widest gap in years. “A railroad like Canadian Pacific, which has the only tri-coastal Canada-U.S.-Mexico network, could do well under a variety of economic circumstances,” Suzman adds.
Railroads have room to increase pricing amid a commodities boom
Sources: Capital Group, Association of American Railroads, U.S. Bureau of Transportation. Data shown from January 1990 through December 2018. The rail category refers to Class 1 rail, or carriers earning more than $505 million in annual revenue. Pricing per ton-mile refers to the pricing charged for transporting one ton of freight across one mile.
Industrials help power an energy-efficient future
The global push to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency is often associated with electric vehicles or utilities harnessing solar and wind power. At first blush, traditional industrial companies making machinery, chemicals and other construction materials might be construed as part of the problem, not the solution.
But HVAC companies like Carrier and Daikin are developing air conditioning and heating systems that could help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Regulations in Europe and elsewhere that require the replacement of older systems with more energy-efficient products could drive long-term opportunity for both companies.
Tighter carbon emissions regulations and infrastructure spending across major economies could also provide tailwinds for Swiss specialty chemical maker Sika, Knowles says. “The company makes cement additives that can reduce carbon emissions and increase durability,” Knowles says. “This may sound like a boring business, but its growth potential is pretty compelling as global emissions standards tighten.”
Tightening emissions regulations are generating opportunity for select industrials

Bargain hunters find “treasure” at dollar stores
When economic conditions become challenging, consumers may naturally become more careful about spending. Many shoppers shift their spending to discount merchants known as treasure hunt retailers. These stores offer clothing, personal care items and household products at relatively low prices, as well as some higher quality products at bargain prices.
“In a slowing economic environment, many people will be trading down to dollar stores,” says portfolio manager Diana Wagner. “Such stores have held up well in past recessions.”
Treasure hunt retailers have outpaced the market in recessions
Sources: Capital Group, National Bureau of Economic Research, Refinitiv Datastream, Standard & Poor’s. Reference periods for recessions are March 2001 to October 2001, December 2007 to May 2009, and February 2020 to March 2020. Consumer discretionary category refers to the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index.
What might be less intuitive is that well-run treasure hunt retailers often have pricing power potential when inflation is rising.
For example, Dollar Tree, which offers a wide variety of items for $1, recently launched their “breaking the buck” strategy. The company initially offered a $5 category of goods, followed by a category for $1.25. “This same approach has helped other treasure hunt retailers generate multiple years of strong same-store sales growth and margin expansion,” Wagner says.
A change in senior management at the company could prove to be another tailwind. “Dollar Tree has been undermanaged relative to its competitor Dollar General,” Wagner observes. “But recently Rick Dreiling, the former CEO of Dollar General, was named chairman of Dollar Tree. I think this could be an important turning point for the company.
“In today’s environment, I look for companies that can improve their businesses and make their own growth happen regardless of what the economy does,” Wagner explains. “Dollar Tree could be one of those self-help stories.”
The bottom line
Investors may be wondering if the digital transformation has run its course. “Not at all,” Knowles says. “Leading digital platform companies, cloud software and autonomous vehicle technology continue to reshape the way we work, live and shop. But many of these companies may have gotten ahead of themselves.”
With inflation rising and the earnings potential for many of these companies still years away, valuations may be extended. “Leading technology companies continue to look promising over the long term,” Knowles says. “But in this environment, I am shifting my focus a bit toward companies that actually make stuff and tend to hold their ground during all types of market weather.”

23,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/dividend-rotation-inflation.html,Rotating into dividends in an inflationary world,Dividends,"April 13, 2022","The recent volatility in growth stocks has brought dividend equities back into focus. Dividend-paying stocks have outpaced their growth counterparts by a substantial margin year-to-date, as fears of rising interest rates and worries about the pace of economic growth in the United States and China have raised concerns over the elevated valuations of many previously high-flying growth stocks.
We saw a similar market rotation in the first quarter of 2021, which fizzled out as growth stocks made a strong comeback. But this year the macro-economic backdrop is different. Inflation is at a multi-decade high, and the Federal Reserve plans to raise interest rates and wind down its quantitative easing program. Earnings reports from some of the larger growth companies, like Netflix and Meta, have disappointed versus expectations. And the value of the more distant cash flows of growth companies makes them more vulnerable to a rise in interest rates.
Dividend stocks have rebounded
Source: Bloomberg. Data as of February 15, 2022, and based on style factor strategies created by Bloomberg. Factor investing is an investment approach that involves targeting specific drivers of return across asset classes (including macroeconomic, fundamental and other statistical measures for building a strategy).
Amid rising bond yields and higher inflation, the market rotation into dividend stocks may still be in the early stages. Along those lines, dividend-income investment could well play a more important role in the total return of a portfolio. Against this backdrop, we explore four emerging trends in the dividend universe.
1. Positive correlation between dividend yields and bond yields
For most of the past 30 years, the relative returns of high dividend-yielding stocks and changes in U.S. Treasury yields had a negative relationship. That relationship reversed in the past two years and high-yielding stocks have exhibited a positive correlation to bond yields. If this trend continues, a rise in interest rates may not dampen prospects of dividend stocks as they have in the past.
Partly, it’s because interest rates are rising, but from a very low base. Even as the Fed begins to raise policy rates, our fixed income rates team expects the 10-year Treasury yield to remain within a range of 2% to 3% with a further flattening of the yield curve led by a rise in short-term rates. Against this backdrop, dividend-paying stocks provide a combination of income and potential for capital appreciation, especially since the valuations of many of these companies appear reasonable following a long bull market for growth stocks. That said, it’s important to identify companies with heavy debt loads or excessive leverage on their balance sheets in a rising rate environment.
Historical relationship between bond and dividend yields has turned positive
Sources: Capital Group, MSCI, Datastream. Data as of December 31, 2021. Yield factors are constructed by ranking dividend yields within a region and then breaking them into terciles, rebalanced monthly. The return reflects the average return of the high-yielding cohort minus the average return of the low-yielding cohort. Returns are market cap weighted. The change in the 10-year Treasury is measured as the monthly basis points change in the 10-year Treasury yield. The correlation is calculated over 24 months and rolled forward on a monthly basis.
2. Dividends are making a comeback, but at a measured pace
We expect a steady increase in global dividends, but at a measured pace. Many companies are taking a more deliberate approach after their experience in the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, when they were forced to substantially cut or eliminate their payouts. Now, amid a deceleration in global economic growth, some companies want to preserve cash in case of a greater-than-expected downturn.
Some industries, such as travel, continue to face a high level of uncertainty. Boeing, one of the world’s largest makers of airplanes, and cruise line operator Carnival are still struggling with depressed travel and have not resumed dividend payouts. Overall, however, dividends continue to recover. Of the 242 companies that either suspended or cut their dividend in 2020, 98 have reinstated payments and only three companies cut their dividend in 2021, according to Wolfe Research data as of February 15.
Companies with pricing power are likely to be better positioned to increase dividends. Household products giant Procter & Gamble, for example, has already raised prices across some of its product lines to help hedge itself against inflation. Consumer staples makers are often hurt when inflation begins to move higher and input costs go up. However, after a period of three to six months, these companies often seek to reprice contracts with retailers and grocers. This ultimately puts them in a better position to recoup those raw material costs, grow their earnings and potentially increase their dividend at a commensurate rate.
Dividend acceleration is also anticipated in Europe, where governments have eased pressures on dividend payments. During the pandemic, governments and regulators had pressed some companies to refrain from making payments as part of a social solidarity movement.

3. Highly cyclical firms take innovative approach with variable dividends
Some companies, especially those in cyclical industries, are adopting innovative approaches to balance their business needs and a commitment to dividend payouts. Take the mining sector, which in 2021 witnessed a boom in dividend payouts. Over the past few years, many large mining companies, such as Rio Tinto and Vale, have switched from progressive dividend policies to a payout ratio. In these arrangements, dividend payouts are determined by a formula tied to certain operating metrics. This shift results in a variable dividend yield over time. But it also gives these companies an enhanced ability to manage their balance sheet and cash flows in a sustainable manner through multiple commodities cycles.
In the past, miners often struggled to maintain a regular dividend during market downturns and would either cut the dividend or be forced to raise debt to cover the payout.
Exploration and production (E&P) companies are also pivoting their dividend strategies. Historically, E&P companies have not been dividend payers, choosing instead to reinvest in the business to pursue more growth in production. But growth backfired at times when fluctuating energy prices hurt investment returns on projects and led to financial troubles.
This is starting to change as firms have become more disciplined. Companies have begun to initiate a regular dividend at a low base, supplementing them with variable or special dividends depending on commodities prices and the strength of cash flows.
For instance, Pioneer Natural Resources last November declared a quarterly cash variable dividend of $3.02 per share, representing approximately $740 million of capital returned to shareholders. EOG Resources has increased its dividend over the past five years and announced a special dividend last July.
Companies hope this newer approach can lead investors to adopt a more benign valuation framework in which to view them and thus avoid excessive stock price volatility. 
4. Financials, energy and health care are areas of dividend opportunity
Financials, energy and health care represent a substantial chunk of the dividend-paying universe, and a confluence of factors appear to support the case of rising dividends from each of these areas.
Financials: Rising rates should help the more rate-sensitive banks in the U.S. and Europe expand their net interest margins, which have been suppressed for many years by persistently low interest rates. This could result in stronger earnings, improved dividend streams and higher valuation multiples.
Banks have been building up excess capital on their balance sheets since the Great Financial Crisis and most are now well-capitalized, having undergone a number of regulatory stress tests. And some banks in the U.S. and Europe are poised to redeploy surplus capital in the form of regular and catch-up dividends after facing regulatory limitations during the pandemic.
For example, Dutch banking giant ING has committed to a minimum 50% dividend payout ratio (the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders, typically expressed as a percentage) of earnings. CaixaBank, one of Spain’s largest banks, stated it would boost its payout ratio to as much as 60% from 50% previously. It’s possible that other European banks could follow a similar course of action as regulatory pressures ease, making this sector a potential source of more consistent dividend income. 
Energy: Large integrated oil companies have long been good sources of consistent dividends for income-oriented investors. They’ve also become more disciplined on supply, having curtailed investment in existing reserves and pursuing new sources of oil.
U.S. oil giants Chevron and Exxon Mobil have demonstrated a steadfast commitment to paying dividends despite some dramatic swings in the price of oil over the past decade. Chevron recently increased its dividend for a 35th consecutive year.
But dividend policies have diverged in the oil sector and calibrating the dividend streams of oil companies has become more challenging. Over the past couple of years, European oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell have cut their dividends amid their transition to investing in renewable energies that are capital intensive and where the return on invested capital is still uncertain. Having reset their dividends to lower payout ratios, the European oil majors have left sufficient room to increase dividends over time.
Health care: Health care companies could be a source of both earnings and dividend growth in the current inflationary environment. Pharmaceutical companies historically have exhibited relatively strong pricing power. While the industry has faced political pressures on drug prices, the more innovative pharmaceutical companies will likely be positioned to raise prices at modest levels.
Like the energy companies, the major pharmaceutical companies recognize that a sizeable portion of their value proposition with the investor base is the dividend payout. That, combined with the potentially robust pipeline over the next several years at several major pharmaceutical companies across all geographies, gives us confidence that this will be another area that can be a well-diversified source of equity income.

Bottom line
Over the past decade, many growth companies have been rewarded in an environment of modest global economic growth, very little inflation and ultra-low interest rates. We appear to be in the beginning stages of an equity market that is starting to show some breadth after a heavy focus placed on the technology-related growth stocks, especially those in the United States.
As market volatility increases due to monetary tightening and elevated levels of inflation, dividend-income investment could play a more important role in the total return of a portfolio. Investors are likely to pay greater attention to dividend payers as companies reinstate or continue to raise their dividends, albeit at a gradual pace. Furthermore, long-term investors have an opportunity to get in at the ground level amid this changing landscape; many companies currently trade at attractive valuations that may not be fully reflecting their upside potential as economies continue to normalize.

24,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/investment-lessons-40-years-china.html,My investment lessons from 40 years in China,China,"April 7, 2022","Steve Watson was a young student when he and his wife, Barbara, first arrived in Wuhan, China, to spend the summer of 1981 studying Chinese.
“The China we encountered on that first visit would be unrecognizable to a traveler today,” recalls Watson, a principal investment officer for International Growth and Income FundSM and portfolio manager for New Perspective Fund®. “We traveled on unairconditioned trains powered by coal-fired locomotives belching smoke that burned your eyes and blackened your clothes.”
There were no private automobiles; bicycles and buses were the primary means of transportation. The city had no subway system. Telephones and air conditioners were out of reach for most people — Wuhan University had only one air-conditioned room at the time — and refrigeration was scarce. The city, a central trading hub in China, had a single bridge spanning the Yangtze River.
Steve Watson and his wife Barbara visiting the Great Wall of China in 1981
Today the city of more than 12 million boasts 11 bridges crossing the Yangtze and a subway with nine lines and 228 stations. Air conditioners, TVs and cars are in abundance.
“Even after decades of closely following China, I am often surprised by its capacity for change and willingness to adapt,” says Watson, who has lived and worked in Hong Kong since 2000.
Watson recently marked the 40th anniversary of that first trip to China. Here he shares how his perceptions of the country changed over the years, lessons learned as a professional investor there and how he is thinking about the investment environment today.

China produces great entrepreneurs
At Capital Group, we have always believed that the quality of a company’s management is critical to the success or failure of the business. So we place a great deal of emphasis on investing with great business leaders, and China has produced some great entrepreneurs.
One example is Wu Yajun, co-founder of Longfor Properties, whom I met on one of my first trips as the new Hong Kong property analyst in 2000 when the company was still nine years from its Hong Kong IPO. I was struck by Madame Wu’s integrity, determination and dedication to her customers and employees. That assessment proved to be accurate in my view, and Wu is among the property developers who transformed the face of China over decades of explosive growth.

I also had the privilege of meeting the founders of what are now some of the country’s digital giants, though I didn’t always immediately recognize the extent to which some would become change agents.
More than 21 years ago I met Pony Ma, founder of a startup Shenzhen-based tech firm called Tencent. The company primarily offered an instant messaging service. Its name was derived from the price of an individual message at the time: ten (yuan) cents.
At the time Tencent consisted of Ma and a dozen or so young employees busily tapping away on keyboards in a dim basement. I was intrigued but didn’t have an adequate sense of what it might become.
China’s manufacturing engine climbs the value chain

Identifying a great CEO is more art than science, and not every business has a strong leader. Years ago I invested in Sino-Forest, a Toronto-listed Chinese company that purported to acquire and manage forest lands and sell them to other investors. In reality, management mislead investors by inventing phony transactions, among other things. In 2017 a Canadian regulator ruled that CEO Allen Chan and several other directors had committed fraud.
While this situation was not unique, there are nevertheless many Chinese companies that recognize the importance of transparency and are taking steps to align with the standards of other countries.
I'm on the council of the Asian Corporate Governance Association, a Hong Kong-based organization which meets with many Chinese companies interested in becoming members and learning about corporate best practices in very practical areas.
In any country we must be sure that what we are hearing is the truth. We need to keep the lines of communication open with company management. We also need to be skeptical and thorough in our research.
China is vast, with many risks and opportunities
For years pundits have predicted China’s imminent economic demise. As early as 2001 in his book, The Coming Collapse of China, author Gordon Chang described how the grip of the Communist Party, bad debt in the banking system, capital misallocation, corruption and property bubbles would conspire to end the Chinese economic miracle.
Contrary to the expectations of Chang and many others, the country resisted collapse. While many of these problems are real, in my experience its leaders were — and remain — focused on avoiding decline. We can watch with concern the danger zones, especially debt buildup and the misallocation of capital, but we should remember that China’s policymakers focus on those same issues.
Indeed, China’s stratospheric growth has often confounded close observers expecting collapse or stagnation. Consider China’s property market, which early in my career I covered as an analyst. The fear of an imminent property collapse has been with us at least since the early 2000s. In 2003, a colleague of mine, reflecting on a trip to Shanghai wrote that he had witnessed mile after mile of new apartments, offices and factories, many of which appeared unoccupied. “I think I am witnessing a bubble of major proportions,” he wrote at the time.
Chinese property prices instead rose dramatically over the years, stubbornly refusing to collapse. It was difficult for many to comprehend the transformative effect of urbanization, alongside a general need for upgrades to the national property stock. Arguably, the country remains under-urbanized today.
Urbanization is on the rise in China’s workforce and markets
Sources: Capital Group, The World Bank. Most recent population employment data is as of 2019.
The vast size of China’s market presents significant opportunity, but it is important to remember that China is no monolith that thinks and acts with a single voice. In fact, with a population of 1.4 billion (as of 2020) spread across 23 provinces, five autonomous regions, four municipalities under direct control of the central government and two special administrative regions, China is a complex and often opaque entity that doesn’t necessarily head in one direction without internal conflict along the way. And the result of that heterogeneity can be outcomes that confound expectations.
Investing in China requires firsthand knowledge
Living in Hong Kong for more than 22 years helps me appreciate China’s many complexities. Our office there opened in 1983 and was located in the apartment of the company’s first employee, Sin-Ming Shaw. That same year, former chairman Jon B. Lovelace spoke before the State Council of the People’s Republic of China in Beijing. Capital made its first equity investments in China in 1994 and formed our China Group in 2001.
Watson with members of Capital’s China group on a visit to Shanghai in 2015
Today we have eight China industry specialists. I consider them essential to our understanding of the investment risks and opportunities the country provides. For example, recent research into the electric vehicle battery supply chain, in which China is a leader, helped some of my colleagues make informed decisions on the manufacturers there.
Our Shanghai industry specialists, working with colleagues in other offices, are currently interviewing hundreds of individuals who live in the largest, most-developed cities as well as the smaller cities to gain deeper insight into China’s property market. Respondent’s reply to questions about their financial situation, buying attitudes, real estate portfolios, property concerns and financing ability, among others.

China’s government wields significant power in markets
When investing in China it’s wise to remember that the government is a powerful actor whose influence cannot be underestimated. Recently, Chinese authorities imposed tight regulations on internet platform companies they felt were out of line with the government’s common prosperity agenda. In some cases these businesses were deemed too profitable or were conducting business at odds with the public interest.
The shifts in government policy surprised many, including me, and shares of the platform companies tumbled. The government also intervenes in other areas of the private sector like education and gaming.
As investors, we must pay close attention to these changes and fully understand the implications of China’s common prosperity agenda. Without a doubt, political risk is higher than in other markets, but China wants a growing and dynamic economy, characterized by a significant degree of innovation. I believe its leaders know this cannot be accomplished solely by state-owned enterprises.
Today many companies are nervous about appearing too profitable — and showing too much growth. But I think they will reach an equilibrium in which business leaders figure out how they can thrive and be appreciated by the government and the government can determine how best to use private enterprise to achieve its long-term economic goals.

Contrarian investing in China today
I am a contrarian investor by nature and today, when shares of many Chinese companies have dropped significantly and investors are increasingly worried, I think it’s good to remain open-minded to investing in China. Lately I have been looking at a variety of industries, including consumer goods, corporate services and even internet platforms. But I caution: It is not an easy market to understand. Deep fundamental research by experienced industry specialists locally is essential.
Investors in China can look for the same things they seek in other markets, such as companies with strong management teams willing to reward shareholders, good products, attention to quality, a focus on profitability, an understanding of balance-sheet efficiency and, of course, skill in navigating government relations.

Microsoft announced its intention to buy video game publisher Activision Blizzard for $75 billion — a transaction that aims to bring the iconic Call of Duty and World of Warcraft franchises under the tech giant’s umbrella. Take-Two Interactive unveiled its plan to shell out $12.7 billion for mobile game maker Zynga, best known for the FarmVille franchise. And Sony agreed to purchase Bungie, creator of the popular Halo and Destiny games, for $3.6 billion.
If all three deals close, that’s more than $90 billion of M&A activity centered on video games, the fastest growing segment of the media sector. The Activision deal is Microsoft’s largest acquisition ever and could vault it to the top of the $200 billion gaming industry, just behind China’s Tencent.

Driven in part by a pandemic-era gaming boom, the fast-changing media landscape is fundamentally transforming the way people interact and entertain themselves in a world where traditional TV viewing and movie attendance are in serious decline. That dynamic makes interactive games even more valuable to the likes of Microsoft, Sony and others.
“I think it’s a testament to how powerful and alluring video games have become,” says Martin Romo, a portfolio manager with The Growth Fund of America®.  “The global gaming industry provides compelling entertainment at a reasonable cost, and it’s already surpassed the movie industry in terms of annual gross revenue. Fundamentally, I think that growth is likely to continue and even accelerate in the years ahead.”

Streaming and social media competition heat up
The disruption extends to other areas of the media world, as well.
“Another big theme playing out here is that you have a lot of companies trying to get into each other’s business,” says Jody Jonsson, a portfolio manager with New Perspective Fund®. “There was a time when they had these sandboxes all to themselves, but that’s changing. Everyone is looking at everyone else’s sandbox and trying to jump in.”
For example, Netflix — the clear leader in streaming video — is encountering fierce competition from Amazon and Apple, as well as old guard media companies such as Disney. In less than three years, Disney’s streaming service, Disney+, has grown to 130 million subscribers.
In the social media space, TikTok is challenging Facebook parent Meta Platforms, attracting hordes of young viewers thanks to the power of its short-form videos. Facebook has responded by launching its own short video offering, dubbed “Reels,” which is growing in popularity — just not as fast as TikTok, which was the most downloaded app of 2021.
Other battles in the media business were lost years ago. For instance, a precipitous decline in traditional TV viewership — especially among young people — raises the possibility that once ubiquitous cable TV packages may no longer exist in a few years. If live sports and news programs ever move en masse to streaming services, that could spell the end of cable TV as we know it.
Young people are increasingly shunning pay TV

There’s no business like show business
This type of momentous change and disruption may appear surprising to some, but it’s par for the course in the media and entertainment biz, explains Capital Group equity analyst Brad Barrett, who has covered the industry for two decades.
“Media is always being roiled by technological change,” Barrett says. “It felt like a huge amount of change when the internet started disrupting traditional media outlets in the early 2000s. It felt huge when YouTube burst onto the scene. And then came social networking, smartphones and video streaming. They all caused a great deal of disruption and continue to do so.

“Don’t get me wrong, there’s certainly a lot going on right now,” Barrett adds, “but change and disruption are staples of the media business.”
One interesting new trend, Barrett notes, is the globalization of content production and consumption. Case in point: Three of Netflix’s most popular series — Squid Game, Lupin and Money Heist — film in South Korea, France and Spain, respectively. And they come with English subtitles, which had previously been a deterrent for many U.S. viewers. Not so anymore.
“Consumers around the world are watching content from all over the world in ways we’ve never seen before,” Barrett says. “It’s great to see English speakers embrace these non-English shows with such enthusiasm. I think it’s a very positive trend, and it’s a real breakthrough for global creativity.”
Metaverse now?
Looking ahead, what will be the next source of media disruption?
Based on the rising number of sensationalist headlines, the metaverse is certainly one candidate. Depending on who you ask, the much-touted metaverse is either the future of the internet or a virtual reality pipe dream.
As technologists have described it, the metaverse is an incredibly immersive and expansive digital world in which people can interact, transact, play games, attend concerts, watch movies, meet coworkers in a virtual office and engage in myriad other activities through user-created avatars.
The idea is so powerful it prompted Facebook to change its name four months ago to Meta Platforms, promising to transform the social media giant into a “metaverse company.” Meta will have plenty of competition, however. Microsoft declared the Activision deal is, in part, driven by a desire to develop compelling content for the metaverse — a world where virtual reality headsets may become as common as smartphones.
There are also many independent websites with a metaverse focus, including Sandbox, founded in 2012, and Decentraland, launched three years later. Users of these sites are already buying virtual land, virtual houses and virtual artwork, often with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano and Solana.
Bandwidth needs are expected to soar amid the growth of the metaverse
Sources: Capital Group, TeleGeography. Actual data through 2020. 2021 to 2023 are estimates.
Neal Stephenson originally coined the term metaverse in his 1992 novel Snow Crash. Ernest Cline further popularized the concept in his 2011 sci-fi novel Ready Player One, which subsequently became a movie. One oft-cited answer when people ask, “What is the metaverse?” is to read Ready Player One or at least watch the movie.
Clearly, the concept has been around a while and it’s not all hype, says Peter Eliot, a portfolio manager with SMALLCAP World Fund®.
“When I ask friends what they think of virtual reality, very few of them have tried it,” Eliot says. “That’s an excellent opportunity for us to leverage our long-term perspective and global research capability to try and understand and appreciate the metaverse now — in advance of what could be a substantial product cycle.
""Though nascent, the metaverse is further along than some might think,"" he adds. ""For example, we’ve already experimented with meetings in VR — and we are thinking through scenarios for mass adoption and its broad investment implications.”

The announcement sparked an uproar that forced the company to issue an apology and hammered the stock price.
Today the world is in a very different place — and so is Netflix: The company is now a dominant streaming service and a megahit-making machine with more than 213 million subscribers worldwide. Its latest breakout, “Squid Game” — a Korean drama about children’s games played with deadly consequences — captivated some 142 million households, making it the most viewed show in Netflix history.
This rising popularity has empowered the company to boost its prices. It has increased subscription rates in the U.S. four times since 2014, a period of robust subscriber growth globally. This is an example of pricing power, the ability to increase prices without losing customers.
Pricing power can be an antidote for inflation
Pricing power, always a positive for companies that can sustain it, may be a crucial competitive advantage in the year ahead. Inflation has surfaced in the economy, and there are signs that it could linger in the coming months. The annual inflation rate in the U.S., as measured by the consumer price index, rose to 5.4% in September, its highest level in 13 years. Rising costs can erode a company’s profit margins and, ultimately, investor returns. But companies with clear, sustainable pricing power can protect their profit margins by passing those costs along to customers.
In some industries, there is greater potential for pricing power
Sources: Capital Group, FactSet, MSCI. Reflects industries within MSCI World Index. Average and standard deviation of gross margins are calculated for the five-year period ended 9/30/21.
With growth slowing and inflation pressures building, as an equity portfolio manager for Washington Mutual Investors FundSM, I think it is essential to understand how companies with pricing power can offset inflation. Here is my perspective on pricing power.
Health care services: A prescription for inflation’s ills
High medical costs are a perennial hot button issue in Washington, and for good reason. Over the last 20 years, health care costs have risen at about 2.5 times the rate of broad inflation, as measured by the PCE inflation rate followed by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Historically, health insurance companies have had pricing power and passed on rising health care costs to their customers through higher premiums. Today, companies like UnitedHealth Group are no longer mere toll collectors on the freeway of rising health care costs. They actually manage care.
Consider UnitedHealth Group, which is focused on helping governments and health care providers reduce spending and improve outcomes for patients. The company has been investing in predictive analytics and care delivery to reduce inefficiencies in the U.S. health care system.
They determined that the most powerful person in the care delivery ecosystem is the primary care doctor, who represents 3 cents of every dollar we spend on health care but determines where another 85 cents is spent. By getting primary care doctors involved earlier in decisions about care, UnitedHealth is seeking to keep members healthy and get more value for every dollar spent. By delivering more value, UnitedHealth can maintain its pricing power while helping to tackle a long-term problem in this country.

Semiconductors: Everywhere, in everything
The story of pricing power in the semiconductor industry is simple: Soaring demand meets limited supply. Today semiconductors can be found not only in mobile phones and laptops but also in everyday household products like refrigerators and ovens. New cars can require as many as 100 chips. Indeed, the auto industry has felt the brunt of the global shortage in semiconductor supply.
The rollout of new technologies, like 5G, artificial intelligence and cloud computing have further fueled the world’s appetite for chips. In August, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing disclosed that it would raise chip prices by as much as 20%.
Consolidation in the semiconductor industry has transformed the competitive landscape, leaving a few dominant players with potential pricing power in specialized areas of the market. For example, companies with proprietary chip designs, like Broadcom, or Dutch chip-component manufacturer ASML, could raise their prices in an inflationary environment.

Beverages: Thirsty for leading brands
The ability to raise prices without serious backlash not only varies across industries but also within them. In the food and beverage industry, drink companies tend to pass along higher costs to consumers better than many food companies. That’s because the beverage industry is dominated by a few players with strong brand recognition.

One example is Keurig Dr Pepper, the producer of sodas and single serving coffee pods. The company has a history of pricing power, particularly for its most popular soft drinks, which include Canada Dry, Snapple and, of course, Dr Pepper.
Video games: Not just child’s play
Once considered a minor niche in the entertainment industry, video games have soared in popularity and now represent the fastest growing segment of the world’s media entertainment industry. The global gaming industry is expected to grow to $225 billion in annual revenue by 2025.
Manufacturers have recently been flexing their power to raise prices. With Microsoft and Sony introducing updates to their Xbox and PlayStation consoles, respectively, game makers have disclosed plans to raise prices on console games to help account for the cost of creating more sophisticated games.
A prime example of pricing power potential in the industry is the annual revenue from free-to-play games like Apex Legends from Electronic Arts and Fortnite, published by Epic Games. Tencent has a 40% ownership stake in Epic. Activision owns King, the publisher of popular mobile game Candy Crush. Free-to-play games generate revenue through advertising, whose rates can be increased as costs go up and through in-game purchases.
Believe it or not, players spend real money on virtual clothing, weapons and other supplies for their gaming characters. Essentially, industry leaders can set the price for such items as they please.

The bottom line for investors: Focus on pricing power
I’m not ready to believe we are headed into a period of sustained inflation. But I do believe rising costs are likely to linger in the coming months, making it the biggest risk investors will face in 2022.
That’s why I am so focused on uncovering companies with pricing power.
I recently asked the investment analyst team that supports Washington Mutual Investors Fund to find examples of pricing power in the industries they cover. They came up with dozens of ideas, ranging from companies in the defense industry to technology and the consumer staples sector.
With slowing growth, rising inflation and other uncertainties on the horizon, 2022 may seem a daunting environment for investors. But I’m optimistic that an active portfolio of select companies with strong pricing power can help investors thrive in the years ahead.

31,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/clean-energy-tailwinds.html,Green revolution will re-energize utility stocks,Energy,"October 6, 2021","After three straight years of stellar performance, European renewable energy stocks have fallen back to earth in 2021. But the future is still bright for green power as the world’s transition to a low-carbon economy gathers steam.
In the short term, investor concerns about rising bond yields and inflation have dragged down the utilities sector. And a flood of cash into environmentally friendly investments in recent years has spurred fears of a green bubble. However, in my view, the fundamentals of Europe’s largest clean energy companies remain strong.
Clean energy is benefiting from three important secular tailwinds: falling renewable costs, new energy policies and economic stimulus. I call these factors the “Green Trifecta.” Moreover, the dominant companies, most of them based in Europe, have many advantages: a long runway of growth opportunities, strong development pipelines and development teams, significant scale benefits, robust balance sheets to fund investments and the benefit of vertical integration that many new entrants typically struggle to match. Although many investors continue to view these companies as bond proxies, there is potential for secular growth for many years.
Falling renewable costs
The biggest reason I expect clean energy companies to do well is that renewable technology just keeps getting cheaper.
Renewables are already economically competitive as it is. And the cost of building a megawatt of clean power generation — whether that's onshore wind, offshore wind or solar photovoltaic — is falling and should continue to do so.
Every year, the average cost of production probably falls by between 10% and 15%. The same is true for the costs of battery storage or green hydrogen. I have yet to see any meaningful slowdown in the rate of cost reduction.
Change in lifetime cost of energy from 2010 to 2018
Sources: UN Environment Program; International Renewable Energy Agency.
As new technology is developed and renewable companies scale up, costs should fall even further. Take offshore wind, for example. Machines are getting bigger. Technologies to install and to build turbines are changing rapidly and the supply chain is evolving.
Denmark’s Ørsted has established itself as a leader in this market by developing its own engineering, operation and maintenance skills. And there is scope to further industrialize the manufacturing process materially. Costs should continue to decline at pace.
So-called “learning effects” are playing a substantial role here. This is still an immature industry, and companies are consistently learning how to operate more efficiently.
Green hydrogen will be an important area to watch. It is seen by many experts as the key to decarbonizing industries like steel and shipping. Hydrogen gas is still expensive to produce without using fossil fuels, but this appears to be the next big energy transition technology.
If I map the improvements that are coming on the cost of the technology used to create green hydrogen, plus where the cost of clean energy is headed, I can see a really significant reduction in costs. They could fall by as much as three quarters over the next five to 10 years, which is very similar to what happened in solar and onshore wind over the last decade or so.
There is a risk that Big Oil could muscle into the clean energy sector and threaten the dominance of today’s renewable majors, which include EDP, Enel, Engie, Iberdrola and Ørsted. However, I believe the market is growing fast enough that there will be room for all. And while oil companies like BP and Shell have started to dip their toes into renewables as part of their net-zero plans, it will be hard to match the existing skills, scale and pipelines of the renewable majors.
Investing in green energy has been fraught with misperceptions based on traditional views of the energy and utilities sectors. Below is my take on the most common of these views and how to consider green stocks through a more appropriate lens.
New energy policies
The second part of the Green Trifecta is the host of new policies being crafted by countries trying to curb their greenhouse gas emissions. Up to this point, little progress has been made on decarbonizing the global economy since the UN’s Paris Agreement went into effect in 2015. However, in recent months it has started looking like the world is kicking into gear.
The U.S. and China, which have long been climate laggards, have made major commitments to cut emissions and embrace clean energy. Of course, it remains to be seen how they back up those commitments, but the direction of travel is clear.
In August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a landmark paper warning that global warming will reach 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2040, even in a best case scenario where the world acts swiftly to cut greenhouse gas emissions. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called this report a “code red for humanity.” The findings raise the stakes for November’s UN climate summit in Glasgow, known as COP26, where governments are expected to announce more ambitious plans to boost clean energy.
Even the International Energy Agency (IEA), an organization that has historically significantly underestimated renewables growth, now appears to realize the scale of what is required to avert a climate disaster. The IEA put out a report earlier this year that flags the need for investment in renewables to increase by three times by 2030.
Trillions in global investments expected for clean energy

The European Union, which is already a global leader in clean energy with roughly 20% renewables penetration, is primed for big growth. The EU plans to source half of its energy from renewables by 2030, and its long-awaited “Green Deal” framework is expected to push that even further, as the bloc seeks to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.
The EU Green Deal will require a huge amount of investment ― as much as €7 trillion by 2050 ― which will come from a mix of private investment, public grants and subsidized lending.
Almost half of the investment is expected to go to renewables, electricity grids, battery storage and similar businesses, all of which are areas in which utilities are expected to invest heavily. For utility companies, this means growth. And that makes the sector more attractive than has historically been the case.
Green infrastructure investment set for big growth

Post-pandemic economic stimulus
Governments around the world are also boosting clean energy as part of their plans to stimulate economies after the pandemic. In many countries, especially in Europe, much of the funding being made available for pandemic relief has strings attached that require it to be used in ways that will cut carbon.
The European Commission intends to provide expanded financing from the European Investment Bank (EIB) to increase support for renewables projects that are close to financial completion. The EIB has also pledged to stop providing money to fund fossil fuel projects, including natural gas.
I expect that European utilities that already have a large renewables footprint will continue to expand. Companies like Enel, Endesa, Iberdrola, EDP, Ørsted and Engie have the biggest clean energy development teams, the ability to upsize their projects in construction and the deepest pipelines of new development projects.
There is global potential beyond Europe, as well. 
The IEA estimates that clean energy investments (in renewables, networks and other areas) could reach $5 trillion per year by 2030, vs. $2 trillion currently. The IEA and International Monetary Fund jointly calculate that this investment could add nearly 0.5 percentage points per year to annual global gross domestic product growth. The IEA also noted that this could create around 10 million net new jobs per decade ― plus additional jobs in construction.
The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has identified green infrastructure as a top theme for Asia’s post-pandemic recovery.
In the U.S., President Joe Biden has embraced an energy plan that is ambitious and detailed. It falls far short of the so-called Green New Deal plan proposed by the Democratic Party’s progressive wing, but represents a sea change from the policies enacted by former President Donald Trump. In August, Biden signed an executive order aimed at boosting electric vehicle sales. He has also promised to back legislation that could spur significant government investment as he tries to fulfill his commitment to transition the U.S. to net-zero emissions by 2050.
At the end of the day, even without government funding, I see very little that could derail the clean energy revolution. The sweet spot in renewables is centered around economics, driven by cost reductions that are set to continue. This industry doesn’t need subsidies, even at low energy prices.
The momentum to decarbonize the world economy is powerful and enduring enough to change the historic playbook. That means it is time to stop thinking of utilities as staid, stodgy value investments that do not produce double-digit growth. These companies are not zero-growth bond proxies any longer, and in my view are poised to deliver strong investment results.

Nowhere is that truer than the media and entertainment sectors where technological advances and work-from-home trends are rapidly changing the landscape.
Structural shifts in media consumption are disrupting the business models of traditional media giants as momentum builds for cord cutting, streaming video services and more interactive forms of entertainment. The resulting shift in viewership habits, especially among young people, could profoundly alter the outlook for media companies in the years ahead.
With that in mind, here are five powerful themes that I believe will play a major role in the evolution of media and entertainment over the next decade.
1. Video games will surpass pay TV as the largest in-home entertainment market.
Video games should enjoy at least another decade of demographic tailwinds generated by young people playing and spending more, and older people continuing to stay in the game, so to speak. Dramatic advancements in graphics quality, increased access to cloud-based gaming platforms, and the further adoption of in-game monetization efforts should allow video games to continue taking time and wallet share from traditional pay TV companies.
Game on: Video game revenues have soared during the pandemic
Sources: Capital Group, Newzoo. 2021 revenues are estimates as of April 2021.
Pandemic-related lockdowns over the past year allowed the gaming industry to shine like never before. Console makers Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (PlayStation) and Nintendo (Switch), as well as game developers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive, experienced huge increases in engagement and revenue as homebound consumers turned to video games for interactive fun and perhaps some degree of escapism.
In my estimation, the $130 billion video game industry should be able to sustain a 5% annual growth rate over the next decade. On that path, video games will eventually surpass the $200 billion pay TV market that is growing at just 1% to 2% per year.

2. The number of U.S. pay TV bundle subscribers will fall dramatically.
In a related theme, I expect almost all general entertainment television viewing to shift away from legacy pay TV bundles and toward on-demand streaming over the next decade. Live sports and news, which account for about 25% of viewing, will be the only viable reasons that some consumers pay $100 or more per month for a bundle of channels.
Only about half of the 125 million American households are avid sports fans, leaving a potential residual base of 60 to 70 million consumers in the bundle. However, it would only take one company buying a few key sports rights and making them available outside the bundle for the declines to accelerate even faster. NBCU is already making the Premier League and Olympics available on the Peacock streaming service. Meanwhile, the renewal of NFL Sunday Ticket in 2022 could spell the end of bundling as we know it. If it is made available on ESPN+, Amazon Prime Video or YouTube TV, that will be another reason for consumers to ditch the legacy bundle.
Young people are increasingly shunning pay TV
Sources: Capital Group, Nielsen. Traditional TV includes live TV and recordings of live TV (for example, using a DVR).
In another blow to the future of pay TV, young people in particular are turning away from conventional viewing in huge numbers. Since 2010, the time spent watching traditional TV by those ages 18 to 34 has declined by about 70%, according to ratings firm Nielsen. Traditional TV has also lost significant ground among people ages 35 to 49. Only the 65+ crowd has remained loyal over the past 10 years.
3. Video streaming will grow to become the primary form of movie and TV consumption.
It is becoming increasingly clear that streaming services are the primary replacement for traditional pay TV bundles. As consumers become comfortable cutting the cord, streaming giants such as Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Video are the primary beneficiaries.
Similar to the video game industry, streaming services got a huge shot in the arm during the COVID-19 lockdowns as millions of new subscribers flocked to them in a binge-watching flurry. Once the domain of old TV shows and movies, new and original content is now driving growth at the major streaming services. Think “Stranger Things” on Netflix, “The Mandalorian” on Disney+ or “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” on Amazon Video.
Netflix, for example, is expected to have a content budget of $25 billion to $30 billion by 2030, allowing it to potentially drop four $100 million series or movies each week. Given that enormous budget, there is a good chance Netflix will make something that most U.S. households will want to watch, enabling it to eventually reach about 90 million U.S. subscribers.

4. Professional football viewership could be in structural decline.
Today, the value of live sports to advertisers and legacy media companies is unquestioned — and the NFL is the gold standard. However, a growing number of NFL players are retiring after only a few years in the league due to fears of permanent injury. Additionally, most of the stabilization in viewership over the last two years has been attributed to the return of the older demographic after the NFL began focusing less on politics and more on the game. Viewing declines continue among younger people who are interested in a broader array of sports and less likely to play high school football.
Anecdotally, I grew up in a Midwest “Friday Night Lights” kind of town where even the freshman team had no trouble finding players and half the population would show up for varsity football games. A little more than a decade later, the freshman team can barely scrape together 25 kids, and attendance is down significantly as parents worry about health issues. As a sports fan, it pains me to say this, but a decade from now, I think pro football viewership could suffer a significant hit.
5. Autonomous vehicles may provide an extra hour a day for media consumption.
With smartphone adoption maturing in the developed world, we are approaching daily media consumption of 10 to 11 hours per person. Driverless cars could provide a major growth boost in the years ahead. Given that the average commute in the U.S. is about 30 minutes each way, that potentially frees up another hour per day of media consumption.
Driverless cars could allow for greater media consumption
Source: Statista. Forecasts for 2020–2030 are as of April 2021.
With an estimated 2 million units sold in 2020, driverless cars currently are not a large part of the market, but are expected to grow exponentially. Boosted by lower prices and government mandates for electric vehicles, the number of driverless cars could reach 58 million by 2030, based on various industry estimates. That could free up even more time to enjoy streaming movies, podcasts and music services over the next decade.

35,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/china-regulatory-risk.html,What does heightened China risk mean for investors?,China,"August 9, 2021","In July, China’s equity market suffered one of its worst monthly declines in a decade amid escalating regulatory pressures. The steep fall has raised concerns about the risks and outlook for investing in Chinese equities.
The latest trigger event was a policy update setting out new restrictions on China’s private tutoring industry. In recent months, China’s regulators have also been issuing antitrust fines, disallowing M&A activities of technology firms and focusing on cybersecurity. A recently passed data security law will also take effect in September.
We asked Noriko Chen, a portfolio manager and member of the Capital Group Management Committee, and portfolio manager Victor Kohn to share their perspectives on recent developments and potential investment implications. Noriko and Victor each has more than 25 years of experience investing in China and are portfolio managers on emerging markets-focused strategies.
What should we make of the recent spate of regulations, particularly those aimed at the education and technology sectors?
Looking at it in a broader socioeconomic context, China’s government wants social and economic stability. Everything related to people’s lives needs to be affordable ― education, health care and property. Anything working against those efforts is likely to be tightly regulated. China’s other major goal is national security, which means control of data and great self-reliance in technology.
China wants to do more to build up and strengthen the capabilities of its domestic economy. This has been previously articulated in its dual-circulation strategy; it took on greater urgency after the U.S. banned telecommunications giant Huawei and pressed other countries to do the same. We still think Communist Party officials want to help support domestic companies that can develop superior capabilities that rival global competitors in a number of areas such as technology and health care. At the same time, they want to make sure that when there are sensitive issues such as data privacy that companies follow government guidelines.
Beijing is saying it wants greater control, but that does not necessarily mean the government wants to punish any company that makes too much money, or to sharply curtail the profitability of some of the country’s most successful companies.

Let’s talk about a few areas that have been the focus of regulation. What about the internet platforms?
For the internet platform operators, the likely aim is to curb monopolistic and oligopolistic power and behavior, such as forcing merchants to sign exclusive contracts, and to limit predatory marketing practices. We believe the objective of this regulation is to foster greater competition and create an environment in which smaller businesses can thrive and consumers of those particular products pay lower prices, whether it be business to consumer or business to business.
This may mean the dominant internet companies have to open their mobile-based internet platforms to competitors. We could also see greater scrutiny of potential acquisitions. In the long run, increased competition might be a healthy development, but in the near term, we could see greater earnings volatility.
Some sectors of China’s equity market have seen rapid growth in market value
Sources: RIMES, MSCI. Data reflects market capitalization of sectors in MSCI China IMI as of July 31, 2021.
On the data front, the government has been more focused on cybersecurity and data privacy requirements since 2017, when the Cybersecurity Law went into effect. Since then, China has implemented and drafted additional laws that are increasingly strict in multiple areas, from national standards requiring localization of cloud infrastructure in China to expanding personal information security and protection where information needs to be stored onshore in China.
Potential implications for companies may include changes similar to those recently enacted in the European Union regarding obtaining and using personal data and where data may be housed. This could result in more companies localizing infrastructure, ring-fencing data domestically (i.e., putting limits on data so it can only be used by particular persons or for a particular purpose), and even a preference for Chinese companies to list on the country’s domestic stock exchanges.

What about online education? The after-school tutoring business has been largely shuttered. What other areas are vulnerable?
China’s top administrative body, the State Council, ordered companies teaching school curricula in the $100 billion after-school tutoring sector to become nonprofit entities and banned them from pursuing initial public offerings or taking in foreign capital.
These for-profit education companies were viewed as widening the economic gap as public schools were losing quality teachers to after-school private tutoring, where salaries were higher, and thus were perceived as hurting lower- and middle-income families. The after-school tutoring also led to very long school days.
No doubt, what happened in online education may extend to other industries, such as video gaming and streaming services, where there reportedly is pressure to enact more rules. Restrictions already exist to reduce the time students and young adults spend on online gaming and streaming. For private sector companies, this may hurt average revenue per user, reduce profitability and increase compliance costs.
The housing market is another area of regulatory focus. What impact do you see?
Property developers continue to face increased regulation as the government seeks to curb excessive risk and debt in the country’s financial system. The government is focused on future economic growth, and excessively high property prices hurt housing affordability. This might lead some families to have fewer, not more, children, at a time when the government has removed its one-child policy due to the country’s aging population.
Looking ahead, there could be tighter pricing restrictions in certain areas or cities. Developers may also become subject to certain financial requirements in terms of acquiring more land sites or developing projects. If this occurs, it could potentially lower a company’s long-term return on invested capital and impact its valuations. This would have the effect of transforming Chinese property developers into quasi-utilities with controls and regulations on their profitability.
Do you expect to see further regulation?
We anticipate more regulatory actions, and there could be further guidelines in areas such as consumer finance, online gaming and mobile apps.
In some areas, such as cybersecurity and digital commerce, current rule-making and stricter enforcement parallel to a degree the efforts by policymakers in the U.S. and Europe to regulate the digital economy and protect consumers.
China’s key economic priorities (2021-2025)
Sources: Capital Group, U.S.-China Business Council, Congressional Research Service and media reports.
As a result, we may continue to see increased volatility in China’s equity markets in the near term, and this may suppress valuations and elevate risk premiums. This current predicament reinforces the need for deep company-by-company research when it comes to investing in China.
And amid this sharp selloff in Chinese equities, we are weighing potential opportunities to invest in unique companies with dominant market share positions whose absolute valuations are much more palatable at current levels.
Which sectors could benefit from these recent policy pivots and regulatory actions?
While certain companies and industries face heightened uncertainty, other business areas that are more aligned with the government’s priorities may present investment opportunities. Some examples are:
Green energy is a priority, and companies helping to facilitate the transition toward cleaner energy in China could benefit from increased investment. Reducing carbon dioxide emissions is a global priority and China has been taking steps in this direction, including enacting policies aimed at curbing coal and increasing natural gas usage. The country has an aging population and pollution has led to falling fertility over the past decade, making clean air a higher priority.
The electric vehicles (EVs) market has been receiving forms of government support. China is already the world’s largest producer of batteries for EVs, which require a fraction of the parts used in ICEs. China has an advantage due to its low cost of capital, and may be able to play a far larger role in the global EV market as some Chinese EV manufacturers already make globally competitive models.
Electric vehicles (EVs) are also linked to the desire for reduced emissions and pollution. EVs require far fewer parts than internal combustion engine vehicles, and their economics are more leveraged to battery costs in addition to manufacturing scale. Chinese EV makers have an advantage due to subsidies, their low cost of capital, the development of batteries and separators domestically, and their ability to manufacture at scale. As a result, China is the largest producer of EVs globally and is poised to play a much larger role in the global EV market.
Pharmaceuticals and medical innovation have been areas of focus since 2015, based on improving access to quality medical care in China and reducing reliance on foreign imports. Regulatory reforms have drastically improved the landscape for both foreign and domestic companies and have helped bring China closer to global standards. A large number of Chinese scientists who were educated and/or employed in the U.S. and Europe have been returning from overseas to help create world-class companies involved in drug development, testing and manufacturing. This has also attracted large sums of venture capital.
Import substitutions are key to China’s effort to reduce its reliance on foreign suppliers and reflect the government’s dual-circulation strategy. While import substitution spans a range of industries, the semiconductor industry is of strategic importance. China’s government is keen to bolster capabilities in semiconductor design and manufacturing, especially after the U.S. banned Huawei and pressed other countries to do the same.
Software and information technology services are also areas of strategic investment for the government. These are underdeveloped industries, and enterprise-focused companies could benefit from increased investment while avoiding regulatory pressure aimed at consumer-facing tech companies.
Does China care about its equity markets and corporate profitability?
From our experience investing in China, we think the government is sensitive to market concerns even though the objectives of party officials can be opaque. In this latest selloff, Vice Premier Liu He and representatives of China’s Securities Regulatory Commission actively reached out to global investment banks and other market participants in an attempt to calm market concerns. They reiterated their continued support for the stock market and private enterprise, including overseas listings. They also emphasized their commitment to further opening China’s financial markets to foreign investors.
This latest bout of market turbulence underscores that investing in China involves greater risks. Since Capital Group began investing in China nearly three decades ago, we’ve learned that it is possible to identify good investment opportunities through the ebb and flow of regulation and economic downturns. It remains a classic stock picker’s market, with a growing number of high-quality companies and ongoing innovation, so we believe it’s important to invest on a company-by-company basis to gain an appropriate comfort level.

36,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/dividend-growth-special-sauce-long-term-investing.html,Dividend growth: The special sauce of long-term investing,Dividends,"July 28, 2021","Ever heard of the Yield Dogs? Neither had Joyce Gordon when, as a young investment analyst in 1990, she was asked by a mentor, portfolio manager George Miller, to help him solve a problem.
“At the time, the analysts covering industries that paid good dividends each made their recommendations in a silo,” recalls Gordon, who was covering savings and loans companies. “He’d hear my idea to invest in a bank, then the utilities analyst’s ideas, then he’d listen to the phone analyst make another recommendation.”
But Miller wanted to compare dividend paying companies across industries so he could identify the best opportunities for the retirees and other income seekers who invested in his fund.
So the analysts compiled key metrics for each company and put them all on one page. They gathered in a conference room to debate the merits of each. Soon the group began meeting every two weeks and taking research trips together.
Thus were born the Yield Dogs, a group of dividend-focused portfolio managers and analysts whose name stands for “Dividends Ought to Grow.” Through the decades, as dividends have come in and out of favor with investors, the Dogs have continued to meet regularly. Today the group has expanded to more than 25, covering companies across all sectors as well as markets outside the U.S.
“Our mission has become more challenging,” Gordon says. “A great many of our investors need income from their investments, and we need many ideas to meet this challenge.”

Dividends are making a comeback
In fact, the past 18 months have been extremely challenging for the Yield Dogs and any other income-focused investors. The pandemic and global shutdown walloped many areas of the market that pay dividends in 2020, including airlines, hotels, energy and financials. In a spirit of caution — or, in some cases, facing questions of survival — companies suspended or reduced their dividends at historic levels.
In the U.S. alone, 242 companies cut or suspended dividends, nearly matching the total for the previous 11 years combined. In non-U.S. markets, particularly in Europe, government officials pressured or required some industries to suspend dividend payments during the crisis.
But the picture is brightening. With the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and the reopening of economies, companies have begun to resume payments. As of May 31, 2021, 76 American companies had reinstated dividends.

“I am pleased to see that many dividends have been restored, and in many other cases, particularly in Europe, are at least under discussion,” says Gordon, who today is a portfolio manager for Capital Income Builder® and American Mutual Fund®, which both focus on dividends. “I expect many more companies will bring them back in the coming months.”
Dividend growth: The special sauce
For many investors, the search for dividend income might naturally start with companies that pay the highest yields. These companies can be sound investments, but the high yield can also be a warning sign. “Companies that have very high dividends to start may not be able to sustain them,” Gordon notes. “The high yield may indicate a company is a melting ice cube, and their business is in decline and they're not reinvesting.”

Instead, Gordon prefers to seek out dividend growers — strong companies that she believes are likely to be even stronger in five or 10 years. “I look for a company that can demonstrate the capacity and commitment to raise its dividends over time,” Gordon says. “I look for dividend growth that matches the underlying earnings growth of the company.”
Dividend growers historically have tended to generate greater returns than other dividend strategies, while also keeping up relatively well with the broader market. People assume that growth companies far outpaced dividend paying stocks over the past decade, and that’s true when you look at the highest yielding stocks. But dividend growers did nearly as well as the overall market.
Dividend growers have outpaced other income strategies
Sources: Jefferies, FactSet Alpha Tester. Results are cumulative total returns in USD (with gross dividends reinvested) of companies represented in the MSCI ACWI (All Country World Index) segmented by dividend policy for the period December 31, 2010, through June 30, 2021. Highest quintile dividend yield are the top 20% of companies by 12-month forward dividend yield. Bond proxies are those stocks that tend to have higher yields but lower growth. They include stocks in the telecom, utilities and consumer staples sectors as well as REITs, railroads and transportation infrastructure stocks. Dividend growers include stocks with consistent dividend growth over the previous five years. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
In addition to providing a growing stream of income, dividend growth can be a sign of management’s more rigorous capital allocation process. “Because they are committed to setting aside some proportion of their earnings for investors, they tend to have better discipline and may be less likely to make some ill-advised acquisition,” Gordon says.
Because it is reflective of growing earnings, dividend growth can also offer a measure of resilience against interest rate hikes, Gordon adds.
Supersize me: The power of reinvested dividends
One company that has consistently grown its dividends is McDonald’s. To get a sense of how regularly reinvesting dividend payments can compound over time, consider a hypothetical $100,000 investment in the company for the 20 years from December 31, 2000, through December 31, 2020, with all dividends reinvested.
Big Macs were probably not what Albert Einstein imagined when he called compound interest the “Eighth Wonder of the World.” But the power of compounding can be a wonder to behold.
In this hypothetical example, the total return of the investment would have been impressive — from $100,000 to $1,057,057, a 957% gain.
Reinvested dividends: Better than breakfast all day
Sources: Capital Group, FactSet. Growth rate calculations for value of shares from reinvested dividends and dividends paid use the first year's dividends payment ($676) as a starting value. This information should not be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell a particular security and is provided for illustrative purposes only.
Take a look at what happened with the dividends. The value of shares from reinvested dividends would have grown from $676 in 2001 to $425,940 in 2020, or enough to purchase more than 106,000 Big Macs last year.
The special sauce of compounding in this example lies in the growth in share count from reinvested dividends. The number of shares purchased with the original investment would have been 2,941. By the end of the 20 years, the share count would have increased to 4,926, a 67% increase. For the length of the investment, dividend payments would have represented 40% of the total return.
Yield Dogs remain vigilant in the hunt for income
Although the search for dividend paying stocks has expanded and become more challenging since the Yield Dogs took their first investment research trip to Cleveland some three decades ago, Gordon remains energized by the work.
“We had virtual meetings recently with 15 companies,” Gordon says. “We spoke with the CEOs and CFOs to try to get a good sense of management's willingness to recommend raising the dividend to the company’s board of directors.”
And as economies increasingly normalize, Gordon says she is finding a broader set of opportunities that she believes represent compelling value for investors. “I look for companies that are yielding around 2.5% to 3.0%, and that are growing their dividends and earnings around 10% or 12% a year. Today I am finding a number of companies that meet that criteria across a wide range of sectors and global markets.”
That’s how the Yield Dogs continue to make a meal out of dividend investing.

38,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/5-investment-lessons-pandemic.html,5 investment lessons from the pandemic,Global Equities,"July 14, 2021","As an investor with more than three decades of experience, the past 16 months stand out in my career as both intensely painful and incredibly instructive. On or about March 23, 2020, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index and MSCI All Country World Index hit bottom, establishing the fastest bear market in history as the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the globe.
Last week, in stark contrast, equity markets hit new record highs, bringing us full circle from the depths of 2020 to the heights of 2021. Given these remarkable milestones, I thought this would be an opportune moment to share some of my learnings from this most unusual time in history.
I’ll start with a brief summary of my mindset as we entered the plague year. In late 2019, I felt confident that the markets were well positioned for a period of strong returns. Inflation and interest rates were low and looked likely to remain so. Banks were eager to lend, and companies seemed willing to invest in productive capacity again — as opposed to share buybacks and questionable acquisitions.
True to my beliefs, I entered 2020 invested as suggested above, with little cash and plenty of cyclicality reflected in my largest holdings. In less than three months, as the global economy came to a virtual standstill and fear gripped the markets, my pro-cyclical positioning looked problematic to say the least. But context is important. And to understand that, it helps to understand my investment style.
Investors move from courage to fear

The Fear Portfolio averages returns for the U.S. Dollar Index, gold prices, S&P 500 Low Volatility Index and 10-year Treasury.
Friends and colleagues sometimes say, “Steve is the kind of guy who runs into burning buildings.” I find that a bit extreme, but it’s true that I am a contrarian investor at heart. As long as I’ve been in this business, I have believed that the market swings from excessive enthusiasm to extreme pessimism. An investor with a reasonable degree of objectivity can benefit from selling the former and buying the latter.
It’s an approach that has served me well for the past 30-plus years, but it also frequently causes pain and tends to pay off mostly during the early stages of market upturns, as pessimism gives way to optimism. Warren Buffett said it best: Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.
That’s me in a nutshell. Now, here are five lessons I learned or relearned in the pandemic that I’m using in my portfolios today:
1. Market crises are inevitable
The advent of the pandemic-driven stock market crisis led me to think of past market traumas I have experienced. I counted 21, including the collapse of the Soviet Union, the bursting of the technology bubble, the global financial crisis and now COVID-19.
I offer this list of events only to highlight the fact that market disruptions are a fact of life for investors. It’s just a matter of time before the train runs off the rails. My list suggests we get one of these events every 18 months or so.
Market disturbances are a fact of life for investors
Sources: MSCI, RIMES. As of 6/30/21. Data is indexed to 100 on 1/1/87, based on MSCI World Index from 1/1/87-12/31/87, MSCI ACWI gross returns from 1/1/88-12/31/00, and MSCI ACWI net returns thereafter. Shown on a logarithmic scale.
No one could have predicted the pandemic but, in hindsight, it would have been wise to consider the chance that something would come along and disrupt the incredible bull market of the previous decade. If history is any indication, it would also be wise to believe that we’d get through it and emerge stronger on the other side. And, indeed, we have so far.
2. Interpreting history isn’t an exact science
This relatively short list of events offers other important lessons, as well, including the fact that history does not necessarily repeat itself in ways you might expect. It’s easy to draw false parallels, and I did exactly that during the early months of the COVID crisis.

For instance, I lived in Hong Kong through the dark days of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic in 2003. I was quick to make overly simplistic comparisons between SARS and COVID. But while SARS was terribly frightening to live through, relatively speaking, it was a fairly minor event. Drawing conclusions about COVID from the SARS experience proved to be a mistake, leaving investors unprepared for the extent and duration of this pandemic.
I will add that I was also similarly surprised by the swiftness and power of the governmental response — both fiscal and monetary — to the COVID crisis. That response arguably helped minimize some of the damage to my pro-cyclical positions during the early months of 2020.
3. Growth or value? Both, at the right entry point
While I acknowledge some discomfort with the overly broad and vague labels “growth” and “value,” I’m going to use them here even as I agree that they lack nuance. The fact is, my fairly limited selection of growth-oriented stocks saved my skin during the worst days of 2020. These included some technology shares, particularly in the semiconductor industry, as well as some consumer-oriented internet and e-commerce companies.
Despite my value bent, I remain a strong believer in the resilience of the tech sector. Entry point is important to me; therefore, many of my tech-related investments are long-term holdings initially added before the market recognized their potential. I like to purchase shares when they are down and out, but I also like to hang on long enough to let the market catch up with what I think is the true value of the company in question. As a result, some of my holdings today don’t look contrarian, but they likely did at one time.
As these stocks rallied amid the pandemic, I gradually trimmed some of them to make room for more unloved areas of the market, including energy, financials and travel.
4. Dividends help pay the rent
Speaking of unloved areas, I have long placed an emphasis on dividends as the principal mechanism for the transfer of value from a company to its investors. I’ve also maintained the expectation that dividends will continue to serve as a stabilizing factor during times of market turbulence.
Sadly, the latter characteristic has been weakened over the last decade and seemed to fall away completely at times in 2020. But I’m not willing to say that yield is useless. Our current unprecedented monetary conditions, coupled with the market’s devotion to fast-growing, society-changing companies, have tossed aside lots of historical norms.
That said, I do not think the value of the dividend as a wealth-transfer mechanism linking companies and investors has ended. In my view, it is more important than ever. And I continue to hold a number of high dividend payers, as well as dividend growers, in my portfolios.
Simply put, I loved dividends before the pandemic and continue to love them now. The shares in my portfolios, like my own children, should pay rent to live with me.

5. Dr. Copper delivers a healthy diagnosis
My outlook, as wrong as it was in the first quarter of 2020, hasn’t changed much today.
Just as the markets have come full circle, I find myself feeling much like I did in late 2019: I am still fully invested and I expect global markets to be higher a year from now. My portfolios are still characterized by a pro-cyclical tint, meaning I favor companies that I believe will benefit from a reacceleration of global economic growth.
I could be wrong, of course, but I feel heartened by the diagnosis of Dr. Copper. Copper, as you may have heard, is the commodity with a PhD in economics, given its keen ability to help predict the path of the global economy. Copper prices bottomed in late March. They are suggesting now that the economy is mounting a strong recovery and will likely continue to do so. Copper may also be warning about mounting inflationary pressures, but for the time being, I do not see inflation, or higher interest rates, as a threat to global equity markets.

I am also finding more attractive opportunities outside the U.S. In my view, the rest of the world, particularly emerging markets, are currently far more attractive from a valuation perspective than the U.S., and my portfolios generally reflect that view.
In short, we now have all the elements, once again, that I was so confidently wrong about in late 2019 and early 2020. A critic might say that I have trouble learning my own lessons. But I would respond that perhaps the plague year was an anomaly. And perhaps we can now live again with investment styles influenced by market history, and place a greater emphasis on the expectation of a return to historical norms.
It’s possible even — dare I say it — that growth is ready to pass the baton back to value and non-U.S. markets are poised to outpace the U.S. in the years ahead.
We shall see.

39,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/value-vs-growth.html,4 trends reshaping the value vs. growth landscape,Global Equities,"July 6, 2021","Persistently weak returns for value stocks over the recent decade have prompted many to re-examine style investing. There will no doubt continue to be value and growth swings. Whether or not the latest value cycle will persist, one thing is clear: Future market developments may involve more than a simple style rotation. What’s more, we believe that the rise of the tech behemoths and the increasing value of intangible assets are upending traditional notions of growth and value stocks.
In our view, four secular forces help explain the extreme valuation spreads we have seen recently. They could also create risks for investment strategies rooted in traditional value-growth frameworks. Here are some observations that we think support this view.
1. Value-heavy industries have been in secular decline
Despite their recent equity rally, banks and energy are examples of value-heavy cyclical industries facing headwinds that are unlikely to reverse following an economic recovery. Sustained low interest rates have hampered banks’ profitability since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) due to low net interest margins — the spreads banks earn from loans relative to deposits. In addition, tighter regulation has led them to scale back on their trading activities and reduce their risk exposures. These factors have put dividends under pressure.
Traditional energy companies also face headwinds, including depressed oil and gas prices, reduced cashflows, production declines, high dividend payout ratios and a 13-year low in exploration and production (E&P) capital expenditures. Meanwhile, investor focus on environmental, social & governance (ESG) issues adds further pressure but could also provide the catalyst for traditional companies to meaningfully transition into renewables.
Utilities are also being challenged. Over the last decade, the industry has experienced flat aggregate demand, weaker wholesale prices and a shift towards distributed power generation. Growing demand for renewables has resulted in the rise of wind- and solar-generated power. As a result, many conventional utilities have been laggards, given their slower pace of change towards decarbonization and electrification. As the industry converges and sees ongoing disruption, the key will be finding companies who prioritize clean power and incorporate digital strategies to adapt meaningfully.

2. Digitization has divided winners and losers
In 2016, Professor Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum, described the world as being in the early stages of the “Fourth Industrial Revolution,” driven by the convergence of the physical world, the digital world and human beings. Being a revolution, this is not just about technology. It brings seismic secular change across industries, just like the previous three revolutions did. Some firms have begun to take advantage of these new technologies and are already transforming, while others have lagged.
FAANG+M (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google and Microsoft) have blazed a trail in enabling key technological advances, such as high-speed mobile internet, artificial intelligence and automation, the use of big data analytics and cloud technology. Their deep economic moats and ability to recognize network effects have made them a disruptive force. However, digital transformation is still an early phenomenon. For example, the global e-commerce market is worth $4 trillion today, yet this only represents 18% of 2020 retail sales, according to data from Statista.
As digitalization grows, industry boundaries may become blurred. Firms that have already begun diversifying outside of their main industry have seen their digital revenue grow 25% higher than the sector average, according to a study by McKinsey Global Institute. This highlights that disruption and innovation aren't confined by value and growth labels.
E-commerce has a long runway for growth

3. Industry composition has narrowed
Industry composition has narrowed over time. Some industries today consist almost entirely of either value or growth stocks. For example, banks have remained dominant within the global value index over the last 20 years, shifting from 16.0% in December 2000 to 10.7% in December 2020. However, within the corresponding growth index, they have collapsed to just 0.2% (from 2.5%) over that period.
Conversely, over the same span, technology hardware has risen to become 9.0% of the global growth index (previously 5.1%) while remaining below 1% of the global value index over the last two decades. This not only makes diversification within style more difficult to achieve, but also suggests that secular changes — as they relate to industry — have become more influential for returns.

4. Intangible assets are making valuation more complex
The rise of the knowledge economy over the last three decades has led to a significant rise in intangible assets.
With technology infiltrating a broader range of companies and industries, intangibles are likely to become a larger component of many firms’ assets. A classic value-growth framework that separates stocks based on valuation metrics may not fully capture how a company creates value; as a result, this framework may be less helpful to investors searching for long-term winners.
For U.S. equities, the proportion of intangible assets relative to tangible assets has increased by 40% since 1990, leading to an equal representation of both, according to an analysis by Research Affiliates. Intangible assets tend to be non-physical and non-financial (i.e., brand, customer loyalty, research and development) whereas tangible assets are physical, such as warehouses and equipment.
Despite both being significant to understanding company valuations, accounting rules treat internally generated intangibles differently, resulting in distorted book value and earnings. For style investors, this challenges the core ability of understanding a firm’s intrinsic value. The issue is not just isolated to growth companies with high intangibles, such as technology stocks, but in fact affects all stock valuations either on an absolute or relative basis.
This doesn’t make traditional valuation approaches useless, but it does mean investors need to make adjustments to determine true value. Some of the industry have responded by attempting to systematize these adjustments, such as including R&D and even adding a proportion of operating expenses.
However, this may still grossly underestimate the contribution of intangibles relating to organizational capital — an area that has shot up significantly and is often unique to the make-up of a firm. Many of these items are difficult to measure, not included on financial statements and require different amortization methods to reflect their alignment to revenue contribution. As a result, a quantitative assessment will not suffice. Instead, a bottom-up approach is warranted to benefit from company-specific analysis and qualitative judgment.
Implications for long-term investors
The secular shifts we’ve discussed here call into question whether we can rely on the persistence of value and growth rotation cycles going forward. It’s clear that value and growth investing is becoming more nuanced as digitalization advances and business models evolve. We see this with banks, which are confronting the threat of FinTech, and with energy companies, which are embracing renewables.
Meanwhile, changing industry composition and a rise in intangible assets are challenging traditional valuation measures. As a result, the distinction between growth and value stocks has become less meaningful. For investors, this means:
Looking across value and growth universes to find attractive opportunities that can help them meet their long-term objectives, regardless of whether a rotation is here to stay.
The disruptive new forces described support a bottom-up approach to understanding a company’s true value.

40,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/tech-stocks-regulatory-risk.html,Big Tech stocks: How to gauge regulatory risk,Technology & Innovation,"June 1, 2021","When it comes to America’s biggest technology companies, it seems like regulatory risk has never been higher. Most large technology platforms are facing pressure from U.S. and European authorities, while lawmakers on Capitol Hill seem more inclined to do something — rather than nothing.
As an internet analyst, I am in perhaps the unusual position of having studied another intense regulatory cycle as a bank analyst: the Dodd-Frank legislative process in the wake of the global financial crisis. During that period, I spent many weeks on Capitol Hill meeting with key lobbyists and congressional staffers as part of my due diligence into the large U.S. banks.
Living through that experience has helped me calibrate my thinking on three key risks faced by Big Tech, which primarily fall into the categories of privacy, content and antitrust. Before I dive into those issues, I’ll share how my experience as a bank analyst has influenced my views.
Applying lessons from Dodd-Frank to this Big Tech regulatory cycle
1. Trying to predict the exact nature of regulatory outcomes is an inexact science. In my experience, it can be very challenging to develop a research edge on predicting regulatory outcomes. In my view, investors tend to spend too much time on it. I believe it is better to spend more time trying to assess how willing and able companies are to adapt to regulatory change.
2. Companies can survive, and even thrive, following intense regulatory cycles. The Dodd-Frank Act included almost 28,000 new rules and restrictions on banks! Revenue pools were curtailed, capital requirements doubled and compliance costs soared. At the time, some thought big banks just weren’t investable. But starting in 2013, a few large bank stocks went on to significantly beat the broader market over the rest of the decade.
3. Regulatory adaptation is a powerful and often underestimated force that separates winners and losers. In the years following the passage of Dodd-Frank, banks adapted to regulation. They restructured, changed their business mix, became more efficient, learned to optimize capital and developed new competitive edges in areas of technology and marketing.
4. Starting valuations matter a lot. A big reason that big bank stocks had such a great run after Dodd-Frank was their low starting valuations. In my view, among the large U.S. tech companies Alphabet and Facebook are already pricing in a typical regulatory shock, based on past studies of other industries that faced such pressures. These tech giants also trade at cheaper valuations than Visa and Mastercard, both of which I consider to be high-quality companies with wide competitive moats and pricing power.
Valuations reflect varying degrees of regulatory risk
Sources: FactSet, Standard & Poor's. Earnings estimates for calendar year 2022 as of May 25, 2021.
5. Politics often prevails more than economic logic in policymaking. I believe there are many examples in banking regulation of irrational policies and unintended consequences. For example, regulators realized that the SLR (supplementary leverage ratio) rule for big banks did not quite work as intended, but it took more than a decade and the risk of a deep recession to recalibrate it. (The rule stipulated the amount of common equity capital banks must hold relative to their total leverage exposure.)

Big Tech faces three regulatory risks: Privacy, content and antitrust
When I look at the major regulatory risks faced by technology companies today, they fall in three broad categories: privacy and data protections, content monitoring, and moderation and antitrust action.
I believe that concerns related to privacy or content may actually strengthen, rather than weaken, the moats of the largest platforms. These companies often boast well-established protocols and have more resources to tackle privacy and legal matters. I’ll briefly address each of them here.
Privacy: This is a nuanced issue with lots of trade-offs, so legislation will be slow. Companies will do more to regulate each other and themselves, while regulation plays catch up.
What’s often missed in the headlines is that the privacy and data transparency restrictions enacted by companies have the potential to be more disruptive to the industry than governmental regulation. IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) is a recent example, with Apple making changes to its operating system. The ad-tech industry relies heavily on individual data in the form of IDFA user data from Apple and third-party cookies to serve targeted advertisements. Google also plans to phase out third-party cookies on its Chrome internet browser.
Ultimately, competitive advantages will likely accrue to companies that have access to first-party data, or data collected on their proprietary platforms or ecosystems. Companies with capabilities in artificial intelligence and machine learning such as Google and Facebook might also be at an advantage.
What’s more, the regulatory landscape will likely become increasingly complex as more governments institute data privacy regulations. Therefore, I think that recent laws in Europe and the U.S. may have the unintended consequence of supporting the largest companies in the industry over their smaller rivals.
“I believe that concerns related to privacy or content may actually strengthen, rather than weaken, the moats of the largest platforms.""
Tracy Li 
Investment Analyst  
Content: There’s been plenty of debate about Section 230 in Washington, and I think it will most likely not be repealed but reformed.
Section 230 was enacted as part of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. It provides limited federal immunity to providers and users of interactive computer services. To date, internet companies have largely been shielded from the content posted on their platforms.
I anticipate bipartisan consensus will build around requiring internet platforms to increase transparency and reporting on content governance — and remove content within 24 hours if ordered by a court. This means compliance costs may rise and fines could be more frequent, but these rising costs will also widen the competitive moats for the biggest companies.
Antitrust: Going back to my Big Bank analogy, one big difference between the two regulatory cycles is that antitrust is a much bigger focus for the internet companies. Perhaps anticompetition for the big internet platforms now is what “safety and soundness” was for the big banks ― it’s the most important systemic problem regulators see.
Therefore, similar to the “too big to fail” framework for banks, we may see a framework implemented for internet platforms where differentiated anticompetition rules are applied based on size.
I don’t see any significant breakups of companies, but I think future M&A will become much harder to do on a meaningful scale. The House investigations into the ”monopoly power” of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook exemplify closer scrutiny of future dealmaking.
In one example of how difficult it can be to prosecute antitrust cases, a federal judge on June 28 dismissed antitrust lawsuits brought against Facebook by the Federal Trade Commission and dozens of state attorneys general. The judge said the FTC's lawsuit did not support allegations that Facebook had gained monopoly status in the social media industry. It remains to be seen whether the FTC will amend its suit and refile.
Tech companies have built profitable franchises since the dot-com bubble

As with most governmental or regulatory actions, it is important to remember that the first report or first version of a bill is almost never the exact text of the final regulation or law. It is very likely that any changes to antitrust law will look very different from the proposed bills.
Likewise, antitrust cases more often end in settlements or fines rather than the breakup of a company. The big companies may in the meantime work to mitigate any potential impact and self-regulate.
It’s worth noting that past M&A activity has allowed many smaller companies to grow and mature under the umbrella of the big parent companies.
For example, Facebook’s messaging service WhatsApp has more than two billion average monthly users in 180 countries yet provides only a fraction of the firm’s revenue. Alphabet derives the majority of its revenue and earnings from advertising; meanwhile, its autonomous driving unit Waymo and health sciences division Verily have essentially no revenues. But these technologies of the future might be worth billions of dollars to investors as stand-alone enterprises. This may make the companies attractive investments regardless of future regulatory actions, based on the secular growth of the industries in which they operate.
Conclusion
The major technology and internet platforms face a number of challenges ranging from privacy issues and content moderation to antitrust and regulatory pressures. However, I believe that concerns related to privacy or content may actually strengthen, rather than weaken, the moats of the largest platforms since these companies often boast well-established protocols and deep resources pertaining to privacy and legal matters.
Furthermore, regulatory outcomes are difficult to accurately predict and often less important to determining company success than factors related to the business itself, particularly adaptability of the management, ability to develop new innovative products and services, and current valuations. By focusing on these metrics and closely monitoring legal and regulatory developments, it is possible to find attractive investment opportunities in the companies facing these pressures.

Several drug developers brought COVID-19 vaccines from initial trials to people’s arms in less than a year. This lightning quick pace defied the expectations of health care professionals and saved countless lives. It was far faster than the development of any similar drug.
Bringing a vaccine to patients is a complex process typically measured in years or decades. Consider this: It took nearly 50 years of research and trials before Dr. Jonas Salk’s polio vaccine was introduced in 1955. More recently, vaccines for chickenpox and Ebola were each developed in about 42 years.
“It’s no exaggeration to call these COVID-19 vaccines one of the greatest scientific accomplishments in our lifetimes,” says health care analyst Laura Nelson Carney, who covers pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in Europe and Asia and holds a doctorate in neuroscience. “What’s more, global manufacturing capacity is also larger than we would have thought possible a year ago: Thirteen billion doses of vaccine will be made this year.”
COVID-19 vaccines were developed at breakneck speed
Sources: Capital Group, NIAID, Our World in Data. Date ranges represent the approximate time between the year the pathogenic agent was first linked to the disease and the year that its vaccine became licensed in the U.S.
A truly global effort
In an age marked by global competition and rivalry, this historic achievement represented remarkable worldwide cooperation. Consider, for example, the vaccine introduced jointly by Pfizer and BioNTech, the first to receive U.S. approval for use.
“It was developed by a Turkish couple leading a German company partnered with a U.S. multinational led by a Greek immigrant with a Scandinavian chief scientific officer,” notes equity portfolio manager Richmond Wolf. “That is a great affirmation of the global nature of innovation today.”
The broader effort also featured the cooperation of companies, governments and academia around the world. U.S. biotech firm Moderna partnered with a division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop a similar vaccine, and U.K. pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca worked with Oxford University to make its version.
“It was developed by a Turkish couple leading a German company partnered with a U.S. multinational led by a Greek immigrant with a Scandinavian chief scientific officer. That is a great affirmation of the global nature of innovation today.”

The U.S. (through Operation Warp Speed) and the European Union provided a level of funding that only governments can muster. “Billions of dollars of upfront government funding allowed companies to do many steps in parallel that they would normally do in sequence,” explains Nelson Carney.
Contributions from around the world pushed the pace of COVID-19 vaccine development
Sources: Capital Group, Time, Moderna, Pfizer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, World Health Organization.
These contributions, and others from around the world, proceeded at a breathless pace:
January 5, 2020 — Zhang Yongzhen, a Chinese virologist in Shanghai, and his team complete a mapping of the virus’s genome after 40 hours of around-the-clock work. When the human genome was first sequenced about two decades ago, it took a team of researchers at the NIH some 15 years at a cost of more than $2.7 billion.
January 11, 2020 — Edward Holmes, a professor at the University of Sydney, places a call to Zhang while he is sitting on a runway in a Shanghai airport. Holmes asks for permission to publicly release the virus’s genome sequencing. Just before taking off, Zhang agrees, and Holmes publishes the sequencing on Virological.org.
January 13, 2020 — Using computer modeling, Cambridge, Massachusetts, biotech company Moderna, led by 35-year-old Hamilton Bennett, develops its first mRNA vaccine candidate. German biotech company BioNTech, led by Turkish researchers Ugur Sahin and Ozlem Tureci, model a vaccine in a similar time frame. Within a few months, BioNTech enters a partnership with Pfizer to develop, manufacture and distribute the vaccine.
January 21, 2020 — The first U.S. case of COVID-19 is identified in Washington State. By this time, the Moderna vaccine was being shipped to the NIH for the beginning of its Phase I clinical trial.
November 9, 2020 — The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is shown to be 94% effective against the virus. Pfizer applies for emergency use authorization of the vaccine in the U.S.
Mid-December, 2020 — The FDA issues emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer vaccine, and a week later, the Moderna vaccine.

Will future drug development be this fast?
For scientists and companies alike, the obvious question is whether this breakneck pace can be repeated. While we may not see the same level of government spending on drug development as on COVID-19 vaccines, the speed of science has taken a great leap forward.
Advances in genetic analysis and the development of the world’s first mRNA vaccines are leading the way to a new era in medicine, says Wolf. These actions have the potential to be most disruptive in the area of immuno-oncology, or the treatment of various types of cancer.
”We can sequence tumors, compare their mutations to the map of the human genome and identify and match therapies to specific mutations,” Wolf says. Indeed, therapies derived from genetic testing have the potential to extend lives and generate billions of dollars in revenue for the companies that successfully develop them.
Advances in genetics and cell research are expanding the cancer drug pipeline

Investment implications
1. Drug discovery goes global
The U.S. and Europe are not the only significant contributors to drug discovery. Chinese biotech company BeiGene recently got the first FDA approval for a blood cancer drug called Brukinsa, says Nelson Carney. Another company, HUTCHMED, will likely get an approval this year for its treatment targeting neuroendocrine tumors.
The role that China plays in the global pharma industry, both as an end-user market and as a source of globally relevant innovation, is only going to increase in the future.
2. The markets are potentially huge
For some types of cancer and other common ailments, the potential addressable market size can be enormous. “The first Chinese PD-1 inhibitor — the same category as Merck’s drug Keytruda — filed for approval in the U.S. only a few weeks ago,” says Nelson Carney. “This is potentially a $50 billion market. The consensus peak sales for Merck’s drug are between $25 billion and $30 billion for just this drug. The patent doesn’t expire until 2028, but there are four other companies hot on its heels, also planning to file in the U.S.”
3. The 2020s will be the decade of health care
If the 2010s were the era for technology titans to lead markets and change the world, then the 2020s may well be the era when health care takes the lead. “There’s never been a more exciting time,” Wolf states. “It started with the sequencing of the human genome. We've developed and improved these tools over the last two decades, and now we’re using them not only to provide more accurate diagnostics, but to actually develop better therapies and to match therapies to those diagnostics.”

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Russell 1000 Value Index recorded an 11.26% total return, far outpacing the 0.94% gain of the Russell 1000 Growth Index. Investors want to know: Will this rotation toward value-oriented shares prove to be a lasting one?
“There can be growing companies that are cheap and cheap companies that grow, so value and growth are not in opposition,” says equity portfolio manager Martin Romo. “We are in a target rich environment, and there are opportunities to invest in fast growing companies as well as classic cyclical companies.""
As a portfolio manager for The Growth Fund of America®, Romo has a mandate to take a flexible approach to growth, seeking opportunities with classic growth stocks, cyclical stocks and companies in turnaround situations with the potential to generate capital appreciation.
Romo recently sat down with us to share how he is thinking about investing in today’s environment, the pandemic’s long-term impact on industries and what he believes are the most important innovations for the next decade.
Turning point: A cyclical rotation may be underway
Sources: RIMES, Standard & Poor’s. November 6, 2020, was the last business day before the COVID-19 vaccine was revealed to have more than 90% efficacy against the virus in global trials. Data is as of 4/23/21.
Do you expect the recent rally in more cyclical areas of the market to continue?
As a former chemical analyst, I've spent a lot of time thinking through the cyclical implications, and there are clearly some powerful ones. We've got fiscal and monetary policy that's incredibly supportive of the stock market. But as a former cyclical analyst, I'm also a bit cautious. The enthusiasm in the market today for a recovery and a return to normal is quite startling to me.
I think there are some industries like commercial real estate and energy where COVID is a bit of an extinction event for their future fundamentals. To be clear, I don’t think these industries are going away, but the basis for making predictions about the fundamentals of their businesses has forever changed.
Some scientists have long theorized that the extinction of dinosaurs was the result of a giant meteor crashing into earth about 65 million years ago. Whatever the catalyst, dinosaurs did not survive dramatic shifts in the climate, whereas warm-blooded mammals did. Some industries will adapt and thrive after COVID; others may be more like dinosaurs and go into decline.

Do you view the COVID pandemic as an inflection point that will lead to major changes in the way we live and work?
I have spent a lot of time with Capital’s investment analysts trying to figure out how the pandemic will permanently change people’s behavior and how that might affect the long-term fundamentals of various industries.
What we found is that select companies are using the pandemic as an opportunity to adapt — to be like mammals, not dinosaurs — by using data, technology and analytics that could lead them to a much stronger competitive position and help us address some of the biggest issues we face in the U.S. today.
For example, health care is at a big inflection point and is changing for the better. Regulators have relaxed antiquated rules related to “in person” visits, and now doctors everywhere are doing virtual visits. We’re also seeing exciting innovation in wearable monitoring devices — including continuous glucose monitors, insulin pumps, implantable EKG loop recorders and connected sleep apnea devices — that are increasingly enabling physicians to monitor patients remotely.

Can you share some of your thoughts on the most important innovations for the next 10 years?
I view semiconductors as the single most important innovation of our generation. This innovation stems from World War II, so it’s not new. But like the cotton gin, railroads, electricity, oil and petrochemicals, and mass production, it has the power to drive industrial development for decades. Semiconductors have become central to telecommunications, the internet, data analysis, artificial intelligence, cars and physical products of all kinds.
Since about 1965, the computing power of semiconductors has doubled about once every 18 months to two years — so-called Moore’s law. We're now into cosmic measurements. And that's why it's impacting almost everything we do. As World War II was a leap forward in mass production, COVID, I think, is a leap forward in the capabilities of the semiconductor.
Recent chip shortages are a case in point. Companies can't get enough of them. Auto companies are struggling with their production costs, and countries are starting to say, “This is a strategic resource, and we've got to either develop our own domestic industry or find ways to capture production.”
Take, for example, specialty retailer Williams-Sonoma, which recently said its online sales have surpassed their physical store sales. They are using that leverage to renegotiate lease agreements, changing the economics of their physical stores as their online traffic has increased. They flipped the world from physical to virtual in one year and aren't turning back.
Companies like Mondelez, which spent billions of dollars and a great majority of their advertising budget on TV, are now getting a 25% greater return online and, in fact, 40% better than that if they think about Google and Facebook as their primary ad sources.
And then, in streaming content services, Netflix became the largest content creator in the world at more than $20 billion spend in 2020.
Semiconductors have enabled this flywheel of innovation and efficiency. The collection of data, the analysis of that data to develop a better product that draws more consumers, whose use generates more data, becomes a virtuous cycle of improvement and wider adoption. It is driving the cost of engagement down and the effectiveness of all our activity higher. And I believe we are still early in this cycle.
Chip suppliers fuel the power behind great products

What are your thoughts about the growth potential for streaming content and video games?
I remember hours and hours spent on my Atari 2600 when I was 10 or 11 years old. Today’s gamers enjoy unlimited use in an interactive format. Considering the relevance and potential adoption of this form of entertainment by the next generation of consumers, the potential return on the dollar is compelling.
Total global spending on games was up 20% last year to $180 billion. Keep in mind that the global movie industry peaked in 2019 at $100 billion. So it's one of these quiet, overnight stories that really isn't overnight, and the thing that's fascinating is that games aren't just participatory. They're spectator sports that are going to take on Broadway and the NBA. Many of these online players collect multimillion-dollar annual contracts in addition to endorsement deals.
Consider that Amazon Twitch, one avenue of spectating, has 1.9 billion hours per month in viewership. That compares to the NFL at 1.65 billion per month. That’s remarkable — and these games are only getting more immersive. There's a company called Roblox that represents a generation of kids — most of them under 15 — who not only are playing in this collective universe with their friends, but they're actually developing games for each other.
The foundation for companies that can leverage these opportunities is profound. So I will watch gaming closely as it continues to encroach on other forms of entertainment.
Streaming entertainment will take center stage

When do you think life will get back to the “new normal?”
We're in the business of figuring out the “what,” not the “when.” Most of our competitors are looking for the when. When will COVID be over? When will rates go up? Neil deGrasse Tyson is famous for talking about the difference between climate change and weather prediction. And he uses a great example where he's walking his dog on a leash on the beach. He's walking to a flag, and his dog is wiggling back and forth. And he says, ""I'm climate change, and the dog is weather prediction."" And we have the benefit at Capital Group of looking forward and looking at elements of climate change that are happening within a company, within an industry, but we also look back to learn lessons from history.
You may be surprised at how much we talk about the principles of our company's foundation in 1931, and how we still hold those commitments to research, a long-term focus and objective-based investing. We take the responsibility of being stewards of capital for our investors incredibly seriously. We've been here for 90 years, 13 market crashes, 15 recessions, 16 presidents, one world war and now a pandemic. But our principles haven't changed. It's a remarkable testament to the success of the model. To use my earlier metaphor, I like to think we’re more like mammals than dinosaurs, adapting to a changing world while staying true to our fundamental DNA.

43,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/semiconductor-shortage-chips.html,Semiconductors could be the new oil: Here’s why,Technology & Innovation,"April 21, 2021","How persistent will the shortage in semiconductors be, and what does it bode for the future of the industry? In our view, the shortage is more cyclical in nature and more acute in a couple of industries like autos and PCs. If anything, we see semiconductors powering the next decade of global growth in an increasingly data-hungry world, much like oil fueled the rise of industrial economies in the last century.
Importantly, the semiconductor industry has evolved from boom-and-bust cycles marked by excessive capital expenditures, poor inventory management and lack of pricing discipline. It is more disciplined and better positioned today, following years of consolidation that has resulted in a few dominant players along each specialized area of the global supply chain.
On the demand side, as corporations, governments and industries transition to 5G technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-based solutions, we believe the industry is prepared to benefit from these powerful tailwinds in the years ahead.
By various estimates, including ours, global semiconductor sales might double from about $450 billion in 2019 to nearly $1 trillion by 2030.
Capacity shortages are more COVID related than structural
A confluence of events has led to this global crunch, none of which we think are structural in nature or affect long-term demand. The automotive industry simply got caught flat-footed after canceling orders with manufacturers during the initial months of the pandemic. At the same time, the world went virtual, accelerating everything digital. This shift increased orders for chips used in personal computers, video game devices, home appliances and cloud-based applications.
Personal computers are the most prominent example. While PCs still account for about a third of the overall semiconductor market, this had been an industry in slow decline over the past decade. This changed last year when the market grew at its highest rate in 10 years.
So, when automakers replaced their orders with manufacturers last fall, there was no capacity for them. Fortunately, the auto sector is a small percentage of the overall semiconductor market, even though it’s a future area of potential growth with the anticipated rise in electric vehicle production. Since it takes about four months to manufacture auto chips, the situation is likely to correct itself by the end of this year. 
Semiconductors play integral role in global economy
Source: Bloomberg. Data represent the share of all semiconductor device applications in 2025, as forecast by Bloomberg.
AI and machine learning are powerful industry growth drivers
An increasing amount of data is being created every day. It started with social media and people posting pictures and videos of their children, food they ate at restaurants and places they visited. Then, in 2018, machines surpassed humans as the largest data creators. We believe this transformative shift will be a significant catalyst for the semiconductor industry.
Going forward, the majority of data will likely be created by machines that require massive amounts of processing power. The challenge will be in increasing processing power and lowering power consumption.
Enormous amounts of data won't reside in our phones, but in data centers. Today, data centers account for roughly 3% of global electricity consumption. If we do nothing to make them more efficient, they might account for 25% of electricity consumption in 10 years. Given this dilemma, the rule of thumb in semiconductor design is to try to reduce power consumption in these components by 30% every two years.
In our view, this is likely to drive growth for more advanced and complex chips used in high-end smartphones and data centers, which will drive up their semiconductor dollar content over the next five years.

A massive semiconductor spending cycle is coming
The world’s largest semiconductor companies are planning to spend billions of dollars on new manufacturing facilities to meet new demand, as well as to navigate geopolitical tensions with semiconductors being seen as a national security priority. The U.S. and Europe both seek to bring critical supply chains closer to home, given that Taiwan controls a majority of the high-end manufacturing production for semiconductors.
Industry bellwether Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) plans to spend $100 billion through 2023 for new chip fabrication facilities, including a large site planned for Arizona. TSMC holds close to 80% market share for leading-edge chip production, and its clients include Apple, Qualcomm and Broadcom.
Semiconductor manufacturing has heavily consolidated
Source: Capital Group, Intel. Shows semiconductor companies capable of manufacturing the smallest chips available in each period. Data as of December 2020.
Meanwhile, Intel plans to spend $20 billion on two new plants in Arizona, and Samsung Electronics is eyeing construction of a new manufacturing facility in Texas worth $17 billion. Spending comes after a long period of capital discipline and industry consolidation, which has left the business with two dominant players: TSMC and Samsung, with Intel a distant third.
However, it’s unclear how these new foundries might benefit the industry longer term, and this is something we’ll be watching closely. Manufacturing processors in the U.S. will likely cost more than in Taiwan or Korea, where most of the current capacity lies. This could create market inefficiencies. It’s also unclear if U.S. semiconductor and technology companies, almost all of whom outsource the manufacturing of their chips to Asia, will want to bring it onshore.
Industry has consolidated across segments
Following several rounds of consolidation, each segment along the supply chain — the chip designers, chip equipment manufacturers, the foundries that make the chips and the companies that test the chips — is dominated by a few companies.
With highly specialized expertise in each of these areas, competitive moats have expanded. Many of these companies are well-managed, with a stronger grasp of customer demand patterns. Pricing power remains high and margins are attractive.
Semiconductor equipment makers: This market has heavily consolidated, with the top five companies controlling close to 75% market share, up from roughly 40% 15 years ago. These companies, including ASML in the Netherlands and Applied Materials and Lam Research in the U.S., have developed wide competitive moats, with each company developing its own specific niche within the semiconductor manufacturing and testing process.
As a result, they’ve become difficult to supplant given the complexities of their machines. For example, an extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machine, used to make advanced chips, is made of more than 100,000 parts, costs approximately $120 million and is shipped in 40 freight containers. ASML is essentially the only manufacturer of this equipment. 
The equipment makers have further developed a servicing model with recurring revenue from machine maintenance. Operating margins have averaged 25% over the past five years and are on track to expand beyond 30% based on our estimates. In years past, they would dip into the single digits.
Memory chips: The industry structure has evolved, and it's become more attractive. Memory used to be a cyclical, commodity-like business. It’s shrunk from around 15 companies globally to three, the biggest being Korea’s Samsung Electronics. In turn, the industry has become more disciplined and rational. And memory chips remain a critical component for computing processors used in a wide range of devices. Although Korea accounts for almost three-fourths of global memory chips manufacturing, the U.S. still dominates the global semiconductor market with about 47% share due to its dominance in fabless, equipment and intellectual design segments.
U.S. semiconductor companies hold significant market share

Strategic importance stirs geopolitical frictions
As semiconductors have become strategically imperative, it has raised concerns among government officials in the U.S., China and Europe, who are all driven by their own motives.
The U.S. worries that while its companies are global leaders in chip design, the country ceded leadership in manufacturing years ago to Taiwan, namely TSMC. Currently, U.S. market share for chip manufacturing is 12%, down from 37% in 1990.
Meanwhile, Europe is concerned that it lacks any manufacturing capabilities for cutting-edge semiconductors. This became amplified during the recent chip shortage that hurt big German automakers.
For China, its leaders want to reduce the country’s dependence on U.S. semiconductors. Given current U.S. trade sanctions, China has defined semiconductors as a strategic imperative in its most recent five-year plan. It will take time, but with the money and resources that China is devoting to the effort, it will develop some capabilities, just as it has in other industries.
As semiconductor chips become integral to virtually every industry and are essentially the “brains” for most things we use, their importance will only grow. Whether the strategic imperatives that drive public policy chip away at some of the industry’s efficiency and execution prowess is a trend we will be closely watching.

But what about Flatley’s Law and Wright’s Law?
None of these observations of technological progress exactly qualifies as an immutable law of nature, like Newton’s theory of gravity, but they have helped paved the way for some of the most compelling advances of the last 50 years. And in doing so they have helped improve the lives of consumers and drive long-term opportunity for savvy companies and investors.
1. Moore’s Law and the proliferation of semiconductors
Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, while working as a researcher in the 1960s, somewhat famously observed that the number of transistors that fit onto an integrated circuit doubled roughly every 18 months to two years, effectively providing more processing power at the same cost. He further observed that there was no reason that progress couldn’t continue.
This was not exactly a law of science, like Newton’s gravitational law, but rather an aspirational one, providing engineers with a goal. “It’s really a matter of how much money you invest in R&D to try to reduce the transistor size,” notes equity investment analyst Isaac Sudit, who has been covering semiconductors for more than two decades and met Gordon Moore as a young analyst. “Now companies invest for a reason — to get a return on their investment. It turns out that industry economics evolved in such a way that enough profits were generated to maintain that pace of innovation. So, it became a self-fulfilling prophecy.”
Moore’s Law and Flatley’s Law are driving costs lower and innovation higher
Source: National Human Genome Research Institute. Data as of August 31, 2020. Values shown on a logarithmic scale. Moore’s Law is the observation made in 1965 by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits double every two years while the costs are halved. Flatley’s Law is an analog to Moore’s Law, attributed to former Illumina Chairman Jay Flatley, that refers to the much more rapid advances and cost reductions in sequencing one human genome.
This pace of progress helped fuel the personal computing revolution in the 1980s and 1990s and paved the way for mobile phones, self-driving cars and health care devices.
As semiconductors become cheaper and more efficient, they will penetrate more aspects of our daily lives. By and large, they will continue to drive improvements in things we already use, like phones and tablets, cars, entertainment systems and appliances. “The costs are dropping to the extent that we can start creating new business models that allow companies to generate money, and that's what we're seeing,” Sudit adds.
Semiconductors are infiltrating every corner of our lives

Two other dramatic advances have changed the landscape of the semiconductor industry: cloud computing and artificial intelligence. “Processing data in the cloud has transformed computing from a cost center to a profit center. Servers are now rented from companies like Amazon or Microsoft, which has further allowed for the creation of new business models,” Sudit says. In the case of artificial intelligence, virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri, and smart thermostats like Google’s Nest are already in use by consumers. “The poster child for advances in artificial intelligence, of course, is the self-driving car.”
So what does all of this mean for investors? The expanding use of semiconductors is a bullish sign for the industry over the long term.
“The semiconductor industry is still relatively young — about 60 years old — so I had the chance to meet most of the founders who drove the initial phase of hypergrowth,” says Sudit, who has a PhD in physics and worked as a scientist in both academia and in the industry before becoming an investment analyst. “But I have also gotten to know the next generation of leaders, many of whom were outsiders with strong business skills.”
Does Sudit’s background in physics provide him with a unique perspective as a professional investor? “Yes, but not for the reasons you might think,” he explains. “Being able to understand technology allows me to focus more time on execution, operations, finances and strategy. These competencies are more important than just technology to build sustainable competitive advantages.”

2. Flatley’s Law and the power of gene sequencing
When the human genome was first sequenced about two decades ago, it took a team of researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) some 15 years at a cost of more than $2.7 billion. A competing effort by medical technology firm Celera was completed a bit quicker for less money. However, it soon became clear that machines used for genetic sequencing would need to be faster and cheaper.
Enter Jay Flatley, former chairman of medical technology company Illumina. He set his company not on a mission to discover some new innovation, but to maintain a laser focus on execution. Today, thanks to improvements driven largely by Illumina, a human genome can be sequenced in about a day for around $500. The cost is expected to soon fall to $100. Flatley’s Law, an analog to Moore’s, exemplified even quicker advances and greater cost reductions.
“For a brief moment in the year 2000, we believed we had all the pieces to the genetic code to solve every disease,” recalls equity portfolio manager Richmond Wolf, who got to know Flatley while covering U.S. medical technology companies as an investment analyst. “It turned out to be an important first step, but it was much less useful than we thought it would be.”
Subsequent breakthroughs in DNA analysis have led to a new era in medicine. ”Today we can sequence tumors and compare their mutations to the map of the human genome,” Wolf says. “We can then identify specific mutations and match therapies to them.” Indeed, testing and therapies derived from genetic testing have the potential to extend lives and generate billions of dollars in revenue for the companies that develop them.
We are developing tools that are rapidly advancing the pace of drug development. “Exciting new modalities like gene therapies, immunotherapies and cell-based therapies that are now changing the trajectory of many cancers could not happen without DNA sequencing,” says Wolf. “Very often the companies that develop and supply the picks and shovels to an industry can make powerful investments. If it were not for DNA sequencing many of these new therapies would not be possible. Just as in the case of semiconductors, if it were not for advances in extreme ultraviolet lithography, Moore’s Law might have broken down years ago.”
Advances in genetics and cell research are expanding the cancer drug pipeline
Source: Cancer Research Institute. Data as of May 2020. Immunotherapy is the artificial stimulation of the immune system to treat cancer. The seven categories of immunotherapy are based on the mechanism of actions to treat cancer.
Breakthroughs in diagnostics may lead to much earlier detection of illnesses, or in some cases treat disease before it progresses. “One of the most exciting things in health care today is something known as liquid biopsy, which uses a sample of your blood to identify cancer at its earliest stages when cells are shedding a tiny amount of mutated DNA,” Wolf says.
More recently genomic research has been a key contributor in the fight against COVID. Not only has DNA sequencing identified and tracked variants, but U.S. biotech company Moderna was able to get a jump on developing its vaccine because a scientist had published the genetic code for the virus.
Quick, accurate and cheap gene sequencing has the potential to put medical researchers on a path to developing personalized therapies for patients. “There’s never been a more exciting time in health care,” Wolf adds. “It started with the sequencing of the human genome. We've developed and improved these tools over the last two decades, and now we’re using them not only to provide more accurate diagnostics, but to actually develop better therapies and to match therapies to those diagnostics.”
3. Wright’s Law and the coming dominance of electric vehicles
A third law related to declining production costs, Wright’s Law, predates Moore’s by a few decades and has broader application. Theodore Wright, an aeronautical engineer, observed in 1936 that when the production of airplanes doubled, costs declined by a fixed rate.
Taking Wright’s observation and applying it to advances in lithium-ion batteries, those most commonly used in electric cars, prices should drop significantly for every doubling of production.
Today electric vehicles (EVs) typically run on a 40-60 kilowatt lithium-ion battery pack, which accounts for about a third of the vehicle cost. Electric cars become cheaper than conventional cars when the battery cost drops under $100 per kilowatt hour (kWh). Over the last decade, the average price has fallen from $917 per kWh to about $137, according to a Bloomberg analysis. In China, battery costs for some vehicles have already reached the $100 threshold, years ahead of previous estimates, according to some reports. And that number is likely to fall below $60 by 2030.
As a result, EV makers have recently been introducing models with lower prices, better performance and longer range. Typically, EV batteries can run 200 to 400 miles before they require recharging. Companies leading the race for cheaper, more efficient batteries include CATL in China, LG Chem and Samsung SDI in Korea, and Tesla in the U.S.
Plunging battery costs will make EVs more affordable
Sources: Bloomberg New Energy Finance, Statista. Prices shown for 2023 and 2030 are forecasts as of December 2020.
The International Energy Agency expects global EV sales to rise 28% a year over the next decade. But with emissions standards tightening worldwide and costs becoming increasingly attractive to consumers, those estimates may be too conservative, says equity investment analyst Kaitlyn Murphy.
“New developments will potentially make EVs cost competitive not only with new gas-burning cars but with the entire fleet of cars on the road, including used cars,” says Murphy, who covers U.S. automobile and components makers. “That’s about 270 or 280 million vehicles in the U.S. If you take a long-term view, that suggests there could be much stronger growth than the market expects.”
Indeed, the emergence of battery-powered cars is changing the economics of the global auto industry. As companies build out their EV fleets, they are also building a base of potential service revenues — from managing your battery to providing updatable software that can improve consumer experience as well as car safety.
“Whether they are legacy automakers or startups, companies that embrace structural change and introduce these advancements quickly have a better chance of winning over the long term,” Murphy adds.
Furthermore, broader adoption of lithium-ion batteries in autos could trigger price reductions that ultimately make the batteries affordable for other uses, like energy storage for public utilities, for example.
Investment implications
Moore’s Law, Flatley’s Law and Wright’s Law should continue to push the pace of innovation across industries and help smart companies take advantage of new opportunities. The sheer speed of change means investors must remain alert as to which companies will be disruptors and which will be disrupted.
Our research efforts help us track the advances leading the technology, health care and energy industries in new directions. Sudit and Wolf had the privilege of knowing these “lawmakers.” More importantly, their years of experience give them a broad perspective that’s hard to match.

45,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/electric-cars-shift-fast-lane.html,Beyond Tesla: Electric cars shift into the fast lane,Global Equities,"March 3, 2021","Ladies and gentlemen, start your batteries.
Sure, we’ve been hearing about the advent of the electric car for a long time. But evidence is mounting that it has already arrived — ahead of schedule.
Consider this: General Motors announced in January that it will stop manufacturing gas-powered cars by 2035, a dramatic shift underscored by a comical Super Bowl ad featuring Will Ferrell. This after Volkswagen, Europe’s largest automaker, disclosed plans to invest $86 billion to develop electric vehicles, digital factories and self-driving cars over the next five years.
Furthermore, in 2020, investor enthusiasm for electric vehicles (EVs) briefly sent Tesla’s market value soaring from $100 billion to $800 billion, making it more valuable than the nine largest traditional automakers combined. Tesla, which sold just under 500,000 cars last year, expects sales growth of 50% a year.
The International Energy Agency expects global EV sales to rise 28% a year over the next decade. But with emissions standards tightening worldwide and EV costs becoming increasingly attractive to consumers, those estimates may be too conservative, says equity investment analyst Kaitlyn Murphy.
“New developments will potentially make EVs cost competitive not only with new gas-burning cars but with the entire fleet of cars on the road, including used cars,” says Murphy, whose research responsibilities include U.S. automobile and components makers. “That’s about 270 or 280 million vehicles in the U.S. If you take a long-term view, that suggests there could be much stronger growth than the market expects.”

The global race is on
Estimates vary widely on how quickly electric cars will dominate the roads, but there is wide agreement that the days of gas-powered engines are numbered.
Shifting public opinion on fossil fuel, government policy and rapid innovation have given new urgency to the rollout of EVs. The adoption curve has steepened in the last five years thanks in large part to government incentives and tighter emissions standards for gas-burning cars.
China and Europe have been particularly aggressive in providing subsidies and setting tight restrictions on fossil fuel emissions. As a result, these regions have been leaders in EV production, a trend that’s likely to continue for the next decade.
Asia, Europe likely to maintain dominance in EV production through 2030
Sources: IHS Markitt, Statista. Figures are forecasts as of September 2018.
There are reasons to believe the U.S. and other markets could catch up faster than expected.
Today, EVs are approaching a tipping point where they will become cheaper to buy than traditional cars even without government subsidies. “It’s undeniable that EVs are becoming more affordable and more popular,” says Wenjie Ge, an equity investment analyst who covers Asian automakers. “And the biggest driver of that change is rapidly falling battery costs.”
Better, cheaper batteries supercharge EV adoption
Today EV’s typically run on a 40-60 kilowatt lithium-ion battery pack, which accounts for about a third of the vehicle cost. Electric cars become cheaper than conventional cars when the battery cost drops under $100 per kilowatt hour (kWh). Over the last decade, the average price has fallen from $917 per kWh to about $137, according to a Bloomberg analysis.
“In China — already a leader in battery production — battery costs for some vehicles have already reached the $100 threshold, years ahead of previous estimates,” Ge says. “And they are expected to fall under $60 by 2030.”
As a result, EV makers have recently been introducing models with lower prices, better performance and longer range. Typically, EV batteries can provide 200 to 400 miles before needing to be recharged. Among the companies leading the charge for cheaper, better batteries are CATL in China, LG Chem and Samsung SDI in Korea, and Tesla in the U.S.

Lower cost of ownership
For the consumer, it’s not just a lower sticker price that will make EVs more compelling. “You're thinking about what an EV can be from a total cost of ownership versus the internal combustion engine,” Murphy notes. For example, typical battery-powered cars will have far lower maintenance and running costs than cars that burn fossil fuels.
Gasoline is an acidic, corrosive liquid that tends to wear down engines, so regular maintenance is required. The U.S. Department of Transportation has estimated that the average American driver spends about 12 cents a mile on gasoline and 9 cents on maintenance.
“And electricity is generally cheaper than gasoline, so running costs are lower over the life of the car,” Ge adds.
Rolling software
Another important innovation that will not only drive cost considerations, but also transform the total customer experience is the introduction of software-defined EVs. The software can receive over-the-air updates to improve functionality and safety while also providing entertainment.
Of course, these over-the-air updates aren't going to solve all challenges associated with cars, but more innovative manufacturers will be able to make vehicles that can learn and improve, become safer and introduce more services over time, Murphy says.
“With that approach, an EV maker can reverse some of the severe depreciation associated with older cars,” she notes.
Murphy says she is seeking to identify the companies with the potential to not only make money selling the cars but also roll out subscription packages that include managing your battery, providing in-vehicle entertainment, improved safety and self-driving technology.
“It’s important to identify who can build this out the fastest,” she says. “Another question I ask myself is how much better is this product going to be, through the software updates, in five years than it is today?”
Just down the road: Driverless cars
Perhaps the most important software update for some models will be the potential for autonomous driving. It seems like we’ve been hearing that driverless cars are only five years away for about 10 years, but as essayist and writer William Gibson once quipped, “The future is already here. It’s just not very evenly distributed.”
Waymo, Google’s driverless car division, has been testing vehicles in the Phoenix area since early 2017. Cruise, its counterpart at General Motors, is testing fully driverless cars in San Francisco, while Chinese startup AutoX has deployed an autonomous fleet in Shenzhen without backup human drivers.
“Over the next few years, they'll begin to launch in more markets, and investors will begin to understand this is a real business, not a science project,” says equity portfolio manager Chris Buchbinder. “By 2030, I believe we will have widely deployed fleets of autonomous electric vehicles operating in most major and many secondary cities around the world. Many people will still have vehicles — just like people ride horses or bicycles for fun — but ownership of personal vehicles will go from being a necessity to a luxury.”
Identifying winners and losers
Indeed, advances in electric and driverless vehicles represent transformational change that is likely to redefine the industry in the coming years. Although EVs are on the threshold of profitability, some models will get there sooner than others. “As investors in companies, not industries, our job is to identify those likeliest to produce cars that can generate earnings over the long term,” Ge says.
In 2020, the clear leader was Tesla, a pioneer in battery technology and vehicle software initiatives. Other front-runners included Volkswagen, which has invested heavily in EV production, and BYD in China. Going forward, those companies quick to embrace structural change and rapidly adapt have a better chance of success over the long term, whether they are auto industry titans or startups.

“There’s a widely held assumption that, with change this disruptive and with startups already competing for market share, it will be hard for incumbents to survive,” Murphy says. “Incumbent automakers must contend with writing off old manufacturing facilities, managing relationships with suppliers and shrinking profit margins. However, they also have vast resources and global manufacturing capabilities. Startups don’t have the associated cost burdens but could struggle to ramp up manufacturing.”
But don’t count the incumbents out just yet. Look at GM, where CEO Mary Bara is disrupting the company from within. In addition to going all-electric by 2035, GM has been investing heavily in Cruise, its self-driving unit.
“This is not an opportunity of the moment, but for incumbents and startups alike it has the potential to become a powerful software and intellectual property business model that has compelling economics to the consumer and to society in terms of safety,” Buchbinder says.
Broader economic implications
The transformation of the global auto industry will have sweeping implications for other industries, including energy, utilities, manufacturing, mining and insurance, to name a few.
“With wider adoption of electric vehicles, we could see peak oil consumption in a few years,” Ge says. Of course, much of the world’s electricity still comes from burning oil, coal and natural gas. What will be needed: more charging stations, more power generation and ultimately cleaner power generation. “In Germany, for example, half the electricity generated from the grid comes from renewable sources. In other countries it is 20%.”
Over time, utilities will need to generate more electricity, eventually from a greater mix of clean sources. In other areas of the economy, demand could soar for raw materials like nickel, cobalt and lithium that are used in batteries.
“This could have geopolitical implications as governments and companies compete for access to these materials,” adds Ge.
Even insurance providers and media companies will be part of the story. “Electric vehicle makers aren’t just building infrastructure around share of miles. They are also looking to take share of wallet from insurance companies, utilities, media and more,” Murphy concludes.
With massive disruption across this global industry, we’re likely to see extraordinary changes in the years ahead that will require professional investors like Murphy, Buchbinder and Ge to keep their eyes on the road. Buckle up for an electrifying ride.

We may find out in the months and years ahead as the world’s largest technology and consumer tech companies come under increasingly aggressive antitrust and regulatory scrutiny.
Government efforts to rein in Big Tech have been underway for years, but 2021 is likely to be a watershed moment due to a number of growing pressures. Political, societal and market-based forces are combining to put these companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and others — under the microscope.
“The sheer size of these companies means they're going to get a lot of scrutiny from every part of society, including government and regulatory agencies,” explains Mark Casey, a Capital Group portfolio manager who has covered the tech industry for more than 20 years.
The rise of Big Tech: FAANG stocks have dramatically outpaced the S&P 500 Index
“Some of these companies have also played key roles in the past two U.S. presidential elections,” says Casey, a manager with The Growth Fund of America®. “When you bring politics into the mix, that helps explain why these regulatory discussions are very prominent right now.”
In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the growth of many tech companies, increasing their power and influence during a severe global economic downturn. Of the top 10 U.S. companies by market capitalization, five are technology or digital businesses and their total market value exceeds $7 trillion — a figure that has grown by 54% over the past year alone.
Landmark litigation is underway
With that territory comes major league antitrust and regulatory risk:
In October, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google, alleging the internet search giant stifles competition. It’s the biggest antitrust case since the government targeted Microsoft in 1998.
In December, the Federal Trade Commission sued Facebook on similar claims that the social media network engaged in anticompetitive practices with its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.
Many U.S. states have joined these two landmark legal actions while, at the same time, countless legislative efforts are underway at the state and federal levels.
A bill introduced in the U.S. Senate last week could make it more difficult for large companies to acquire competitors. In Florida, state lawmakers are considering legislation that would fine social media companies for de-platforming political candidates.
“Part of what makes this so complicated,” Casey notes, “is that Democrats have a whole set of issues with these companies — largely based on antitrust, privacy and hate speech concerns — while Republicans have another set of issues, particularly when it comes to the perceived censorship of conservative viewpoints. So there’s really no easy scenario where these companies can just make a few changes and everybody’s happy.”
Another element accelerating the regulatory push is the recent episode involving a group of retail investors who organized themselves on an internet chat board to drive up the stock prices of GameStop, AMC Entertainment and other struggling companies. When brokerage firms and trading apps imposed trading limits, some of those retail investors lost big. In a rare bipartisan move, Republicans and Democrats have called for Congressional hearings, which are expected to begin next week.

European influence
U.S. politicians and regulators seeking to limit the power of Big Tech can look to Europe for inspiration. European authorities have been far more aggressive in their regulatory efforts, including the threat of huge fines for violating data protection rules and engaging in anticompetitive behavior.
The European Union was the first to enact major online privacy laws in the form of the General Data Protection Regulation, adopted in 2018. EU officials have since followed that up with a series of proposed regulations designed to block certain acquisitions, curb hate speech and provide more information to consumers about how their data may be used for targeted advertising.
“Many of these provisions are already being implemented by U.S.-based internet platforms because of the European regulations,” says Brad Barrett, a Capital Group analyst who covers ad supported internet companies. “Europe doesn’t have many of its own national champions in the social media industry, so it’s perhaps easier for the EU to be more aggressive in this area and for the U.S. to follow when it makes sense.”
So far, Barrett notes, the EU rules haven’t had a major impact on technology companies from a profit or revenue perspective.
FAANGs have proven to be unique while revolutionizing different industries
Regulators face uphill battle
Assessing the regulatory risks of large tech companies is a complex task, Barrett explains, given that they operate in different industries with vastly different competitive profiles — everything from retail to advertising to television. That said, in his assessment, the antitrust cases against Google and Facebook aren’t strong and likely won’t result in any forced breakups.
The government is facing “an uphill battle” to win these cases, Barrett says, evidenced by the fact that some members of Congress are pushing hard for changes in antitrust law. 
“That by itself is an admission that it’s difficult to find antitrust violations based on case law going back 20 to 30 years,” he adds.
Not to mention that many of the products provided by Google and Facebook are free, diminishing traditional antitrust arguments that rely on pricing power to help determine monopoly status.
Is regulatory risk already priced in?
How should investors evaluate the outlook for Big Tech, given the potential for some sort of government intervention in the years ahead? One important question to ask is: Do company valuations reflect the risk? In other words, are they “priced in” to the stocks?
Looking at the FAANG stocks as a bellwether for regulatory risk, the two companies that are currently at the center of high-profile lawsuits — Facebook and Alphabet — are trading at significantly lower price-to-earnings ratios than, for example, Amazon and Netflix. In fact, Facebook is trading just above the average P/E for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index despite its rapid growth rate and strong free cash flow.
Valuations for some Big Tech companies don’t look excessive
Last week, Facebook reported a fourth-quarter profit of $11.2 billion, a 52% increase from the same period a year ago. Alphabet, which trades at a slightly higher P/E than Facebook, reported a quarterly profit of $15.7 billion, up 40% from a year ago.
“These companies operate in large and growing markets, they have long revenue runways and they are very profitable,” explains Capital Group analyst Tracy Li, who covers internet companies. “If the regulatory risks were not present, in my view, they would be trading at higher multiples.”
Unlike the dot-com bubble, tech company profits are more in line with prices
Breakup risk: The parts may be greater than the whole
In the unlikely event that one or more of these companies is forced to break up, a reasonable argument could be made that some of the spinoffs could be worth more on their own, Li notes. Indeed, sometimes the parts can be worth more than the whole.
WhatsApp, for instance, which was acquired by Facebook in 2014, currently does not make money. But as a stand-alone company, it would likely command a high valuation due to its user base of more than 2 billion people in 180 countries and the opportunity to monetize the service in the future. The same could be said for Instagram and Facebook Messenger.
“The fact that all of these businesses are under one umbrella does tend to obscure the value of each business,” Li says. “As we’ve seen with past antitrust cases, such as the breakup of AT&T or Standard Oil, the results can be quite favorable to shareholders over the long run.”

53,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/lessons-5-decades-investing.html,Lessons from 5 decades of investing,Long-Term Investing,"September 2, 2020","One of Claudia Huntington’s most successful investment decisions hinged on a single question. She was meeting with Lotus Development Corp., a pioneer of spreadsheet software, while the company was struggling through a challenging product cycle. The beleaguered CEO was facing heavy criticism and less than thrilled about meeting with her.
“My initial meeting was hard to get, but I was finally granted 15 minutes,” Huntington recalls. “When I entered the room I could see he was tense, bracing for the inevitable questions about the coming quarter.”
But that wasn’t her question. “I told him, ‘Let’s not talk about the next few quarters. Can you talk about your vision for where you plan to take this company over the next five years?’” The executive’s body language immediately relaxed, and the conversation ended up running two hours. “He opened up about the risks and opportunities the company faced, his long-term strategy and how he planned to execute on that strategy,” says Huntington, who liked what she heard and decided to invest.
That proved to be a good decision because the company turned around and the stock outpaced Wall Street expectations.
Of course not all her investments have worked out as well as Lotus, but Huntington believes her focus on long-term results, a trait she shares with her Capital Group colleagues, offers a clear advantage when evaluating companies and their leaders. “Quarterly results are important too but taking a longer view can lead to rich dialogue with company leaders,” she says. “Our best investment decisions are made when we are on the same wavelength as the CEO. We gain a deeper understanding of their talents and the likelihood that they can successfully navigate risks and execute their strategy.”
Huntington, who began her investing career in 1973 — a period of rapidly rising inflation and volatile markets — has decided to retire in 2020. The portfolio manager and former president of AMCAP® Fund recently sat down to share insights and lessons learned over nearly half a century as a professional investor.
What are the most important lessons you’ve learned?
I’ve learned that this business is more art than science. Early in my career I thought it was primarily about math and perfecting my model. Sure, you need math, but the more you invest, the more you realize it’s about making judgments — about people and about the future. There are no facts about the future, so you have to try to look around corners.
Perhaps the most important lesson I’ve learned is that a company’s management is essential to its ultimate success or failure. If you have a great company run by a poor CEO, the odds of that company turning into a good investment are low. On the other hand, if you have a mediocre company in a mediocre industry with a superb CEO, then it is much more likely that company will turn out to be a good investment. So, being able to calibrate CEOs and management teams is an important skill to develop.
Can you share some examples of CEOs you’ve encountered who were difference makers?
A recent example is Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive. He was not an obvious choice to run the company when he succeeded Steve Ballmer in 2014, but he has excelled for a number of reasons. One thing Satya does at the end of every meeting, regardless of whom he is meeting with, is ask, “What do you think?” The fact that he wants to encourage participation, to hear other voices, is such a demonstrable, cultural advantage.

WATCH
One of the most effective CEOs I’ve ever encountered was Mark Donegan of Precision Castparts, a maker of specialty metals for the aerospace and defense industries. Donegan is a detail-oriented leader with a laser focus on productivity and a great allocator of capital. But what is most special about Donegan is the culture he has fostered at his company. He created a real sense among his employees of working together to do the right thing.
I often ask executives to describe the culture of their company. Some have great answers; others look at you like you came from the moon. The best companies are often the ones with a very strong culture.
Identifying a strong CEO is no guarantee of long-term investment success. Years ago, I invested in a company called Silicon Graphics largely because I believed the CEO was first-rate, and I had faith in his strategy for the company — a maker of specialized computer systems for graphic applications. We identified the opportunity early, and the company experienced strong growth. The investment was a good one — until it wasn’t.
The CEO eventually got interested in politics and essentially assigned running the company to a subordinate who made a series of bad decisions. I had established such trust and faith in the CEO that I didn't look more closely when changes were made. That was an important lesson for me.
How has culture shaped you as a portfolio manager?
At Capital, we are encouraged to focus on long-term results. In fact, under The Capital System℠, compensation paid to our investment professionals is heavily influenced by results over one-, three-, five- and eight-year periods. Increasing weight is placed on each successive measurement period to encourage a long-term investment approach. Our culture is also designed to encourage what I call the lonely idea. By definition, good investments are not something everyone knows about. It takes a great deal of courage to identify an opportunity early on that has the potential to be a great investment.
One example of a lonely idea is Precision Castparts. On paper this company was not that interesting. It was in the industrials space, with a concentrated number of clients and limited supply sources, so there were risks. When I traveled to Portland to meet with CEO Mark Donegan, I found the headquarters on the third floor of a small unmarked industrial building next to a gravel parking lot down a dirt road. Clearly this was a cost-conscious company. I found it to be to be well-managed and operationally focused.
When I presented this unlikely investment idea to our investment group, I was challenged by my colleagues. They were polite and respectful, but skeptical. “Why would you want to invest in a specialty metals company in this stage of the cycle?” But the beauty of The Capital System, is that I could act on my conviction to invest, and by doing so I convinced some colleagues to invest with me. Our system allows that bright spark of the lonely idea to shine through — rather than being dimmed by consensus.
You began your career in a tumultuous time for markets and have seen your share of downturns. What advice do you give younger colleagues?
I started my investing career near the beginning of one of the worst bear markets since World War II. My first job was at another asset manager that had three rounds of layoffs in my first six months. Capital ended up acquiring the firm’s assets, which is how I came here. This early experience taught me that this is a very volatile business. I also quickly recognized a stark difference between the way Capital and my former employer managed uncertainty. Capital has learned to manage through volatile periods and views down markets as opportunities.
We try to reassure associates during periods of uncertainty and encourage them to focus on long-term opportunities that may arise. With the COVID-19 pandemic leading to a recession and bouts of volatility earlier this year, I shared with younger colleagues a list of 10 tips for weathering market downturns to provide some perspective from my own experiences. Among them are “don’t dwell on what the market did yesterday,” “pay attention to balance sheets,” and “keep talking to companies.” The easiest thing to do in a downturn is to just freeze, so many of my suggestions try to help colleagues manage emotions and take action.
For a primarily U.S.-focused investor, you have spent much of your time traveling abroad. Why is that important?
First and foremost, traveling gives me fresh perspective on the companies that I follow. So many companies today, whether they are in or outside the U.S., have global operations and customer bases. I can travel to India, for example, and visit a pharmaceutical business. That's going to give me perspective on all pharmaceuticals, wherever they are.
I travel to get some notion of the competitive environment, but also a sense of where challenges could come from or new opportunities. To truly understand a company — or a market or an industry, for that matter — you really have to go see it with your own eyes. You can’t do this job from a Bloomberg terminal.
As an investment analyst in 1982, you predicted the coming of the mobile phone. How do you think the world will be different in 10 years?
I have witnessed remarkable change in my career, not only in terms of investing opportunities but also global opportunities.
When I started, there were no cell phones, no internet, not even desktop computers. I am certain there will be comparably huge leaps in the coming years. Many will be in technology, but there will be leaps in other areas. With respect to energy, I expect there will be some fabulous storage technology and better battery technology. That’s going to have a tremendous impact on the kind of transportation people use. There will be major changes in agriculture, in the way farms operate.
I think one of the most exciting areas is medicine, where I believe there will be great leaps not only in drug discovery, but also in virtual medicine. People will be monitored, diagnosed and treated remotely.
What drew you to a career in investing?
I would describe myself as someone who has always been interested in learning about the way things work. That’s what drew me to study economics in college and then to a career in investing.
What’s more, Capital has a culture that encourages lifelong learning, which really has been a perfect fit for me. In fact, as we speak I am working on a project with several Capital analysts to quantify the role that management plays in a company’s stock returns. I can’t wait to see the results of this study, and I’ll be working on it until my last day in the office!

54,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/quality-growth-stocks.html,Quality Growth: Resilient businesses in a low-rate world,Global Equities,"August 26, 2020","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Growth stocks have continued to outpace value stocks during recent market volatility
Quality Growth, a subset of the growth universe, has shown relative resilience
Experienced management, solid balance sheets and strong cash flows characterize Quality Growth companies
Growth stocks have continued to outpace value in the market decline and subsequent recovery following the COVID-19 outbreak. In our view, growth will continue to command a higher premium relative to other investment opportunities for two reasons:
True growth investment opportunities are fewer in a world of low economic growth rates.
An ultra-low interest rate environment reduces the discount rate to evaluate stocks. This allows investors to extend time frames, which tend to favor growth opportunities.
Since the 2008—2009 financial crisis, the premium placed on growth companies has been most pronounced in non-U.S. markets, but it has been a rising trend in the U.S. as well. That said, sources of economic growth are likely to change and, in some areas, be redefined over the next few years on the path to recovery. Capital Group’s fixed income specialists similarly see this era of low rates continuing for an extended period due to powerful deflationary forces such as technological advances and aging populations in developed countries.
Key ingredients of Quality Growth
As the economic environment has deteriorated, members of our investment team are finding that not all growth opportunities are on equal footing. Increasingly, many of our portfolio managers are focusing on a subset of growth companies that they view to be Quality Growth.
While there is no perfect screen or set of rules that can embody all aspects of Quality Growth, they are finding that these companies typically share the following ingredients:
Led by strong management teams
Maintain solid balance sheets
Operate in a growing market
Exhibit the potential to increase market share and maintain pricing power
Clearly, not all of these characteristics are exclusive to Quality Growth companies — strong balance sheets and high-quality, experienced management teams are traits that portfolio managers look for across all types of companies.
But when these traits are found in companies that also have attractive business models or are tapping into secular growth opportunities with a long runway, they can potentially make for attractive investment opportunities.
One example of a strong secular growth trend is subscription-based businesses. They have compounding characteristics that have been attractive in most market conditions, often gaining share even in periods of economic slowdowns as consumers and enterprises shift behavior.
An emerging participant is ServiceNow, which creates workflow management software that helps enable efficiency. ServiceNow has seen a rise in the use of its tools by the customer service functions of many corporations, as the software can handle and sort phone, chat and email inquiries.
A more familiar name is Microsoft. Its business has benefited from sticky subscriptions through the Windows Operating System, a ubiquitous suite of Office products and its Azure cloud service. Collectively, these features help create a durable business model.
Another example is online payments, where significant and durable shifts in how consumers and merchants transact business are fueling growth. PayPal has been among the market leaders.
Are these all-weather stocks?
An interesting aspect of many Quality Growth companies is that they have shown greater resilience and quicker recoveries versus the broader market. This chart shows the MSCI ACWI Quality Index as a proxy. The companies in this index are selected based on high return on equity, stable year-over-year earnings growth and low financial leverage.
While Quality Growth companies, as a group, have often held up relatively well during market downturns, it is important to remember that their ability to do so has been largely predicated on their ability to continue growing, even when many other companies cannot.
Therefore, the cause of the downturn is an important consideration, and some quality growth companies may fare better than others in some downturns. Moving forward, some potential beneficiaries in the aftermath of COVID-19 may be businesses that operate in areas of video streaming and gaming, grocery delivery, automation and biotech.

China’s economic rebound from COVID-19 will likely be gradual. We anticipate growth will pick up in 2021 as more fiscal stimulus is pumped into the economy.  
Stimulus policies are likely to shift in favor of technology-related infrastructure, rather than property or lending to state-owned enterprises, in a push to create more self-sufficiency amid trade tensions. 
We see pockets of growth for premium consumer brands, as well as certain companies within the biotechnology, internet services and technology fields. 
China is home to many innovative companies with large addressable markets, offering the potential for sizable long-term growth in market value.
China was the first country to shut down its economy to blunt the spread of COVID-19, and the first to emerge. As the world’s second-largest economy and a key cog in supply chains and consumer markets, China’s economic progress over the next 12 months will play a vital role in restarting the worldwide economy.
Since the outset of the pandemic, China’s policymakers have been far more restrained in terms of stimulus compared with the U.S. and European Union. They have sought to stabilize the economy rather than flood it with too much credit like in prior economic downturns. While tensions with the U.S. continue to weigh on its economy, China has developed a powerful domestic demand engine, and government leaders are focused on increasing domestic spending and unlocking the significant savings of the country’s populace, which are much greater than those of Western countries.
So far, China equities have fared relatively well as measured by the returns of the benchmark MSCI China Investable Market Index. And China’s economy rebounded in the second quarter. But bouts of volatility are likely amid a tepid rebound in consumer activity, supply chain concerns and differing opinions about the strength of China’s economy. This could offer investors with a bottom-up, long-term approach selective opportunities to take advantage of periods of market weakness, especially given the persistent and potentially increasing geopolitical tensions.
We asked two longtime Capital Group portfolio managers with years of experience living and working in Asia for their views on China’s getting back to work and what kinds of companies might benefit. We’ll begin with a macro-level perspective from our chief China economist.
Recovery likely gradual and stimulus unlike past downturns
Stephen Green, Capital Group economist in Hong Kong
Overall, China’s industrial economy is largely operating back at normal levels, and leading activity indicators such as trucking volumes, electricity production and weekly cement shipments are mostly back to 2019 levels or higher. However, I believe the return of growth will be slow and gradual.
Industrial profits remain weak, and China’s exports could decline as much as 20% to 30% on a year-over-year basis; though so far, exports are holding up surprisingly well. Consumption is generally lagging due to elevated unemployment levels and fears of possible pay cuts. The majority of households report in surveys that their incomes are down year-on-year. People still seem to be reticent to leave their homes, and some of this is reflected in data for travel and dining, which are well below 2019 levels.
Gross domestic product: Our research suggests that China’s economy contracted far more in the first quarter than the government’s official 6.8% decline. While China reported year-over-year second-quarter growth of 3.2% on an annualized basis, I project China’s economy will see no growth for all of 2020, which contrasts with the sell-side consensus forecast for modest GDP growth.
Stimulus package: As the scale of the growth shock becomes clearer, Beijing is launching a mini-fiscal stimulus package. Don’t expect the stimulus to be of the same magnitude as in the global financial crisis. It could amount to five percentage points of gross domestic product, compared with 10 percentage points following the 2008–2009 global credit shock. This could be enough to stabilize China’s economy in the second half of 2020 and provide some support to growth in 2021; it usually takes 12 to 18 months for credit to work its way through the economy.
New infrastructure: Much of the stimulus will go toward infrastructure — things like upgrading the electricity grid and building metro and suburban rail networks, as well as improving the environment. But Beijing also wants some of the funds to go into ""new infrastructure"" spending that would pave the way for the development of 5G telecommunications networks and data centers.
Local champions begin to emerge in technology and health care
Chris Thomsen, Capital Group portfolio manager in London
While the success of Tencent and Alibaba is well-documented, the coronavirus outbreak underscored the capabilities of some companies that may emerge as the next set of domestic champions within China’s technology and health care–related sectors.
I believe the more innovative domestic companies may continue to benefit from an emerging trend of localization, or the procuring of goods and services from within China, that has partly come about given the dislocation in some supply chains and structural trade issues. To some degree, we have begun to see some of this activity in the fields of enterprise software and semiconductors. Meanwhile, the health care sector has been a natural beneficiary of COVID-19, and the pandemic should further accelerate the development of this industry within China.
Cloud computing: China has lagged the U.S. in adopting cloud-based technology. Startups and internet companies have been among those utilizing it, but traditional Chinese businesses have been particularly slow. Working from home changed the dynamic significantly, and companies unable to operate during the lockdown were forced to look for cloud-based solutions. An emerging participant is Kingdee International Software Group, which competes against Germany’s SAP and U.S.-based Oracle.
Semiconductors: China wants to strengthen its capabilities in the semiconductor field as part of a broad plan to become more self-sufficient in key areas of technology. Silergy Corporation, which designs and manufactures a broad range of high performance analog integrated circuits and is gaining share in China’s chip market, may benefit as the market is projected to grow substantially with demand for 5G and cloud-computing applications. In the first quarter, company sales rose 42% to $95 million versus the same period in 2019.
Biotechnology: Through their internet-based platforms, Tencent and Alibaba have seen a massive surge in activity for their health care services, with people connecting to doctors on their mobile devices. There are also Chinese biotechnology companies on the front lines of developing vaccines for COVID-19. Overall, China’s aging population and demand for higher quality services from private sector hospitals could present intriguing opportunities for investment in the years ahead.
Travel: Short-term turbulence, long-term runway
China’s middle class has developed a love of travel. They were frequently in search of new overseas experiences before the pandemic brought travel to a halt. Before the shutdown, the number of international flights from China had grown an average of 16% per year since 2000, boosting tourism and travel-related stocks. The current trajectory of that growth remains unclear, and I’m not certain when air traffic will return to pre-coronavirus levels.
After the SARS pandemic in 2003 and 2004, tourism and travel across Asia eventually rebounded as governments put standards in place and the public gained confidence that those measures were effective.
Despite recent setbacks, there is a long growth runway for travel-related services in China. Possible beneficiaries could be Shanghai Airport and Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. Both are geographically positioned in desirable regions within China.
Consumers — A tale of two income groups
Winnie Kwan, Capital Group portfolio manager in Hong Kong
COVID-19 has changed consumption patterns in China. The migration to digital services has accelerated — from cooked food and fresh grocery delivery, to online medical and education services. Meituan-Dianping, China’s largest food and services delivery platform, has replaced Baidu as the third-largest internet business after Tencent and Alibaba.
There is also an increasing focus on health and wellness, with a greater share of the consumer’s wallet dedicated to food safety, exercise and private health care. As a result, I anticipate growth in protection-based insurance products to have a long runway.
Affluent consumers in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities (larger GDPs) are still confident, while consumers in Tier 3 and 4 cities (smaller GDPs) have become even more price sensitive. Based on our research, premium brands and trading up are still relevant themes in more affluent Tier 1 and 2 cities. Meanwhile, national mass market brands have found it difficult to maintain pricing power.
Luxury goods, premium cosmetics and skin care have experienced strong recovery since China’s economy reopened in March. This has benefited multinationals that have a significant presence in China with portfolios of aspirational brands. European luxury brands face less competition from domestic Chinese companies.
Outside the larger cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, people are increasingly price wary due to employment concerns. Millions of migrant workers have yet to return to their jobs, and a large number of college graduates are trying to find jobs. Internet-based platform Pinduoduo has enabled cost-conscious consumers to compare prices and buy goods in bulk. During the first quarter, the company saw its average monthly users increase 68% to 487 million year over year.
Over the next 12 to 24 months, travel patterns should temporarily shift from international to domestic destinations due to restrictions and some degree of scaling back by price-sensitive consumers.
The quality of companies varies significantly
It can be easy to lose sight of long-term trends and potential investment opportunities amid a barrage of political rhetoric and heightened geopolitical tensions. Capital Group has been visiting Chinese companies and investing in them for several decades now. China is home to many innovative companies with large addressable markets, offering the potential for sizable long-term growth in market value.
More than ever in this rapidly changing and uncertain global business environment, stock selection is key, since the quality of companies in China varies significantly and sectors are at different stages of maturity.

58,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/growth-investing-next-decade.html,Greetings from 2030: Growth investing for the next decade,U.S. Equities,"July 9, 2020","Companies, Anne-Marie Peterson observed early in her investing career, go through life cycle changes just like people do. Where individuals can experience childhood, college, raising children and having careers, companies might go through periods of rapid growth, maturation, shifts in their competitive landscape and sometimes stagnation.
“Consider Home Depot, which you could say grew up too fast,” recalls Peterson, who got her start as an equity analyst covering U.S. retail companies. “They opened a lot of stores rapidly, without building the necessary back-end infrastructure, like supply chain management systems.” With the market saturated and growth stagnating, Home Depot continued to open stores. The company appeared to be reaching its breaking point.
An outsider, Frank Blake, was hired as CEO. “He had no retail experience but was a great listener and had a knack for making the complicated simple,” says Peterson. “He identified the problem, halted new store openings and set about fixing the supply chain on the back-end. In other words, he stopped growth to ultimately resume growth.”
Like many of her colleagues at Capital Group, Peterson’s early experiences as an analyst helped shape her approach as a portfolio manager. “Retail is a very idiosyncratic sector,” she explains. “What I learned covering retail is that people matter a lot, and growth can come in many forms.”
Peterson recently sat down with us to share her perspective on growth investing over the next decade and offer some predictions for what the world might look like in 2030.
What characteristics do you look for in a growth investment?
My underlying investment framework is driven by three key principles:
Principle 1:
Revenue growth drives earnings, which in turn drive stock prices. My starting point is to look for above-average revenue growth as a path to long-term earnings growth potential. Take the cloud as an example. Last year Microsoft’s Azure and Amazon Web Services together generated about $60 billion in revenue, which represents a fraction of the $700 billion addressable market for corporate IT spending.
Principle 2:
People matter. When I invest in a stock, I tend to look at it as underwriting a management team or culture, so I find it important to feel comfortable with a company’s leadership. In fact, I spend as much time trying to understand the people as I do the business and financial statements. For example, when I was evaluating e-commerce company Shopify, I met several times with Tobi Lutke, the company’s CEO, to get to know him. This is a founder who is mission-driven and working hard to ensure Shopify is a 100-year company.
Principle 3:
Change is a key catalyst for growth. Sometimes a CEO change can be a major catalyst, as was the case with Frank Blake at Home Depot or Satya Nadella at Microsoft.
During periods of significant change, industry structures can shift — for better or worse. Some companies get stronger, others grow weaker or fail. There's uncertainty, but also an opportunity to identify what the market might be missing about a company’s prospects. And there are few periods of change more significant than the one we are living through now.

10 predictions for long-term investors
GET THE E-BOOK
Are today’s coronavirus-related behavior shifts creating a fertile environment for growth investing?
There are opportunities to find great long-term investments in any environment. The current period is no exception. Every market downturn is different. What’s interesting about the current period is that the disruptive tech and consumer companies that led during the expansion have continued to lead. Typically the market leaders going into a downturn haven’t led during or coming out of a downturn, but I think we are seeing a fundamental shift happening.
As of June 30, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index was down 3.1% year-to-date, but that figure represents the sum of several individual companies. A look beneath the surface reveals a wide divergence of returns. On the one hand, there are those that have benefited from coronavirus-related demand, like e-commerce platforms Amazon (up 49%) and Shopify (up 138%), and streaming services like Netflix (up 41%). On the other, there have been a number of companies that have struggled, like United Airlines (down 61%), Royal Caribbean (down 62%) and Boeing (down 43%). So it's been a tale of the haves and have nots. And I think the key question for long-term investors is, which of these moves are enduring?
Which trends today have that potential to endure?
The headline is that COVID-19 accelerated the secular shift toward digitization. As Shopify’s Lutke put it, “We are experiencing 2030 in 2020.” If the digitization sailboat was cruising along with steady tailwinds before, the pandemic turned those tailwinds into strong gusts. And that sailboat turned into a speedboat and covered more ground.
I believe this represents the acceleration of a structural change that will be long lasting. Traditional TV’s scheduled programming and advertising model is more challenged than ever. Bankruptcies among retailers have accelerated, surpassing the global financial crisis, and I think more are coming. And while these shifts have been happening for a long time, what's interesting is that they're still in the early innings. In the U.S., e-commerce is growing rapidly but still represents only a fraction of total U.S. retail sales, and trails adoption in China and other markets.
Payments provide another example. During the pandemic, many of us have been forced to pay for things digitally. It can be difficult to change a habit, but once you do it can be sticky.
Even with respect to the public sector, the digitization shift is picking up momentum. Many local government offices have fallen far behind the digitizing curve. But companies like Tyler Technologies, a software developer founded in the 1960s, have been helping government agencies move their systems to the cloud, digitizing processes like the issuing of parking tickets and even operating courts virtually.
What other sectors are experiencing these shifts?
In health care, the adoption of telemedicine, or online patient-doctor visits, exploded in March, a trend that I think is going to endure. Patients have had access to these services for a long time, but the adoption rate had been low. As a result of COVID-19, regulators and health care providers relaxed their rules to allow more digitization. At the same time, patients and doctors, partly out of necessity, got more comfortable with remote appointments.
Jason Gorevic, the CEO of telemedicine provider Teladoc Health, recently said, ""What we thought would take years to happen happened in a matter of months. This isn't an inflection point. It's a shift in the demand curve."" This shift is also important news for patients. Where you see this digitization happen, it's leading to better outcomes and lower costs.
You said growth comes in many forms. Can you talk about the types of growth you look for?
I try to look for companies whose products or services can make the world better, and a lot of the transformational change we are seeing today has that potential. I define growth more broadly than the traditional definition. I look for growth in three broad stages, depending on where a company is in its life cycle.
Growth stage 1:
The first group is what I would call early-stage growers. These tend to be innovators whose offerings have the potential to disrupt existing business models. They often have potentially large addressable markets and their products are early in the adoption curve. A recent example is Shopify, which provides small merchants with resources for payments, customer engagement, shipping and marketing. While Amazon’s focus is on the end consumer, Shopify’s is on the small business owner. Its services enable small businesses to run their stores and websites for hundreds of dollars a month and to access consumers globally. Lutke, the founder, is a product guy — he developed his software originally to sell snowboards. He is on a mission to empower small merchants of the world.
Another example in this category is the aforementioned Teladoc, which has seen demand for its offerings rise as patients and doctors have gotten more comfortable with remote appointments.
Growth stage 2:
A second type I look for are the durable franchises with long potential growth runways. Amazon could be considered an example. Platforms like an e-commerce site are strengthened by the number of participants. And sales beget more sales. As a result, they have more to invest in their technology. As I mentioned earlier, e-commerce today still only represents a fraction of total retail sales in the U.S.
Growth stage 3:
A third growth category is mature companies able to get more out of existing assets, whether it is through a turnaround or an existing approach. A decade ago, Home Depot would have fit this category. Examples today might potentially include medical device maker Boston Scientific and railroad operator CSX Transportation.
When you first joined The Growth Fund of America® as a portfolio manager, how did you prepare for the role?
One thing I did was look through Capital’s archives back to 1974 and read every annual report. I wanted to get a strong sense of the fund’s personality — what we're trying to accomplish for our shareholders — from the voices of my predecessors. I was struck by a write-up in the 1982 report that featured several investment professionals discussing fundamental change in the industries they covered. Claudia Huntington, who is still a portfolio manager at Capital and was covering technology at the time, mentioned this thing called a cell phone that would be available in the future. And our late chairman Jim Rothenberg, who was a mentor to me, predicted the development of the flat-screen TV. At the time it must have sounded like crazy, pie-in-the-sky stuff, but it came to be. We're still trying to identify change today.
How do you think the world will be different in 2030?
I think one of the most interesting things we could see in 2030 is a version of David and Goliath: the rise of the small business and the power of the individual over the large corporation. We are seeing a new wave of online software providers and e-commerce companies that are developing back-end infrastructure tools that have the potential to empower small- and medium-sized businesses. Historically, a big investment budget and big IT department would be needed to run a retail business.
The tools being developed today lower the barriers of reaching customers and managing inventory. Someone will be able to start a business, selling T-shirts around the world for example, in 15 minutes. Whereas the benefits of the first wave of online services developed by Google and Facebook accrued to a few big companies, I think the next wave of advances can lead to the dispersion of economic power and opportunity to smaller companies.
Similarly, in the health care sector, I think we will see the democratization of health care. Today most of us don’t have immediate access to fluctuations in our cholesterol or heart rates. I think we'll see more remote monitoring that can connect to smart delivery systems of medication and other therapies.
We are seeing glimpses of it. Companies like Insulet and Dexcom are developing devices that enable remote monitoring and delivery of medication for diabetics. A decade from now this could be more broad-based and might include sending alerts to your doctor. With companies like Intuitive Surgical developing robotics for surgeries, these advances could converge to the point where remote medical devices and robotics will allow a specialist in Japan to perform a procedure on a patient in Nebraska. Anyone will have access to leading specialists, no matter where they live. The pieces are in place for this to happen, and all of this has the potential to improve outcomes and reduce costs.
The bottom line is that we are living in an incredible time of change. Change drives opportunity for active investors like us.
And at Capital, we have the luxury of thinking very long term. My bonus is mainly paid over an eight-year period, so I am truly paid to think about what 2030 will look like — or at least 2028. There are new emerging companies today that we may not hear about, but a decade from now will be household names providing value to their customers. Out of every crisis is born something good.

Dividend-paying stocks face pressure on many fronts today.
Fundamental research and diversification are the keys to investing in income-oriented companies.
Given ultralow interest rates, dividend payouts remain a crucial source of investment income.
With much of the world in quarantine, dividends are at a crossroads.
As the global economy remains essentially shut down, many companies face tough choices when it comes to returning cash to shareholders. Dividend cuts and suspensions have jumped to the highest level in more than a decade. But even in this environment, some companies have maintained payouts and even raised them.
More than ever, this divergence in dividend commitment emphasizes the need for stock-specific research to help identify high-quality companies that can weather the storm. Interest rates also remain ultralow in developed markets, further underscoring the need to find companies that can generate sustainable income for investors who may be struggling to find it in bonds.
Dividends face challenges
In periods of economic duress, dividend cuts and suspensions are not unexpected. In the United States they have reached a level last seen during the Great Recession, as sales have slowed and companies scramble to preserve cash. In Europe, dividends have come under immense political pressure as government regulators warn banks to preserve capital amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Many investors may be surprised to learn the degree to which ethical and social considerations are influencing dividend policy in a wide range of industries. This is especially prevalent among companies in France, Spain and Germany.
Many European companies have delayed annual meetings to reevaluate conditions later this year. Given that some companies in Europe pay dividends only once or twice a year, instead of quarterly, the monetary impact and uncertainty is significant.
Amid plummeting oil prices, Royal Dutch Shell on April 30 reduced its dividend for the first time since 1945, cutting it by more than 60% to 16 cents a share.
Rays of hope
Despite a severe global economic downturn, not all companies are following the same path. Many remain committed to sustaining and even increasing their dividends.
For example, in Europe, Nestlé and Zurich Insurance accelerated plans to hold virtual annual meetings and committed to paying dividends as planned. German chemical giant BASF is sticking to its payout, and several utilities in the U.K. have expressed strong support for sustaining their dividends during this turbulent time.
Among U.S. companies, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson have raised their disbursements, and Starbucks is maintaining its dividend. Even in the hard-hit oil sector, ExxonMobil said on April 29 it would maintain its quarterly dividend despite reporting a $610 million first-quarter loss.
Assessing dividend sustainability
As companies take different paths, our investment analysts are rigorously scrutinizing balance sheet strength, financial conditions and cash-flow outlooks on a company-by-company basis.
Take the U.S. communications services industry. The business has consolidated in recent years, making several companies both providers and distributers of content. This consolidation has had financial ramifications.
AT&T acquired DirecTV and, more recently, Time Warner. As a result, AT&T’s net debt rose to $150 billion and its earnings became more economically sensitive due to the cyclical nature of the advertising business. On the other hand, Verizon Communications has roughly $130 billion of net debt and less exposure to advertising. Verizon stock has yielded less than AT&T, but its dividend is perceived to be safer by the market.
Our equity analysts collaborate with our fixed income team to evaluate the risk that a company may cut its dividend to avoid a credit rating downgrade. High levels of corporate debt could impact dividend sustainability.
Our analysts and portfolio managers are also weighing subjective issues that could impact the dividend, such as:
Acquisitions: Companies may prioritize acquisitions, buying smaller or weaker competitors for strategic reasons while valuations are distressed, and cutting dividends to accelerate debt repayment.
C-suite changes: A recently appointed CEO or new chairperson of the board may not have the same level of commitment to past dividend policies.
Board composition: Some board members may be executives of other companies who have cut dividends and may not have any qualms about doing it again.
Consider upgrading your portfolio
A new paradigm is emerging for dividend-paying stocks and, therefore, we believe it is important to upgrade the quality of income-oriented portfolios. In our view, an effective approach involves:
Diversification: Generating a disproportionate amount of income from a given sector or region can increase the risk of a severe reduction of dividend income. Companies in many sectors outside of traditional areas, such as technology and health care, now pay dividends. A global approach, where appropriate, also expands the pool of dividend-paying companies, providing further diversification.
Fundamental research: Financial and liquidity analysis can help assess the ability of a company to pay its dividend in a variety of scenarios through collaboration with equity and fixed income analysts.
Holistic perspective: This involves assessing myriad qualitative and subjective factors including any recent management changes, the composition of the board and the company’s approach to M&A during a time of distress.

63,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/defensive-stocks.html,What’s a defensive stock in 2020?,Asset Allocation,"November 12, 2019","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Defensive stocks aren’t easy to define in the age of disruption.
Traditionally defensive companies may have trouble living up to their reputation.
Some growth-oriented stocks may display defensive characteristics.
What’s a defensive stock? It’s a simple question that used to have a simple answer. In years past, defensive stocks were reliable, conservative, boring investments in the consumer staples, utilities and health care sectors. These companies generated steady cash flows, paid solid dividends and didn’t have “dot-com” in their names.
More recently, however, there’s been a discernable shift in investor views of what constitutes a defensive stock. Many businesses that were previously considered defensive — including food, tobacco and telecommunications firms — have been disrupted by technology advancements, changing consumer behavior and fierce competition in a global economy.
As investors search for defensive stocks ahead of the next recession, they may find that a broader definition is warranted.
“A defensive stock is one in which a company’s earnings and revenues have the potential to hold up fairly well during a recession,” explains Alan Wilson, a portfolio manager with The Growth Fund of America®. 
“So the key question is, will the companies that have displayed defensive characteristics in the past continue to do so in the future? I’m not so sure about that,” Wilson says. “It may depend a great deal on the cause of the next downturn.”
Food for thought
For decades, food companies have been considered classic defensive investments. People need to eat, right? Indeed, during the global financial crisis in 2008–2009, some food-related companies held up relatively well compared to the overall market, including McDonald’s, Panera Bread and Walmart. But that was before the business found itself being disrupted by new entrants like Amazon, changing consumer tastes, massive consolidation and competition from online food delivery startups.
Kraft Heinz is one example of a food industry giant that stumbled as consumers increasingly embraced fresh food and organic options over processed products. In February, Kraft Heinz took a $15.4 billion write-down on the value of some of its struggling brands, which include Velveeta, Maxwell House and Miracle Whip. The company also cut its dividend by 36%.
""Traditional industries like the food business face some challenges and may not be as defensive as we once thought,” says Jonathan Knowles, a portfolio manager with New Perspective Fund®. “Like so many other industries, it’s going through a period of disruption that is altering the investment landscape.”
Is the best defense a good offense?
Knowles believes the definition of a defensive stock has changed in recent years. It may now include companies with strong earnings growth, innovative products, pricing power and the ability to shake up the status quo in established industries.
“Lots of people might disagree with me,” Knowles says, “but I would argue that a company like Google parent Alphabet has some defensive characteristics, based on its cash flow and dominant position in the internet search market.” Knowles puts Facebook in this category, as well.
These are growth-oriented companies by most measures, Knowles adds, but they may still hold up well in a sustained downturn based on their robust earnings potential, ability to innovate and relatively attractive valuations. 
Examining growth companies
Defensive stocks are often associated with traditional value investing, but select growth stocks certainly shouldn’t be overlooked, adds Lisa Thompson, a portfolio manager with Capital Group.
“In some of the relatively minor market downturns we’ve seen in recent years, there are many examples of quality growth companies that have done better than the overall market,” Thompson explains. “They tend to be companies with strong management and solid balance sheets that can navigate through difficult environments.”
Moreover, some growth-oriented stocks can show countercyclical characteristics. One example is CME Group, the Chicago-based exchange company that facilitates trading in derivatives, options and futures. CME’s revenue has tended to rise during periods of extreme market volatility.
As trading activity increased, CME’s stock price has generally done the same — as happened in the fourth quarter of 2018 when the S&P 500 declined by nearly 14%. During that period, CME’s stock price rose 12%.
Utilities stocks may also maintain solid defensive characteristics in a downturn, provided they are run by competent, experienced management teams and operate in a market with a stable or growing population.
Search for quality dividends instead of “value”
Just as it used to be easier to identify defensive stocks, it also used to be relatively straightforward to pick a defensive investment strategy for your portfolio — just shift to a value-oriented index and call it a day.
But it’s important for investors to understand that value stocks aren’t always defensive. For example, many stocks that are included in popular value indexes don’t pay dividends and don’t have high credit ratings. About 22% of stocks in the Russell 1000® Value Index paid dividends of less than 0.1% in 2018, and roughly 40% of the rated companies in that index carried ratings of BBB– or lower. Companies with questionably high debt levels are also not uncommon.
A missed debt payment or a ratings downgrade could send share prices tumbling. A better strategy may be to focus on higher quality companies that are most likely to maintain consistent dividend payments, says Capital Group portfolio manager Joyce Gordon, principal investment officer of the dividend-focused American Mutual Fund®. 
“It all comes down to fundamental research on individual companies,” Gordon explains. “Different types of companies can provide downside protection in different types of markets. It’s our job as investors to figure that out — one company at a time.”
Joyce Gordon is an equity portfolio manager at Capital Group with 41 years of investment experience as of 12/31/21. She holds an MBA and a bachelor’s in business finance from the University of Southern California.

Gaming is the fastest growing segment of the media and entertainment industry.
Smartphones are enabling a new generation of gamers around the world.
Leading companies are putting a focus on internet streaming and free-to-play games.
As a kid growing up in Bettendorf, Iowa, Capital Group equity analyst Nathan Meyer had two passions: sports and video games. “There wasn’t much else to do in Bettendorf,” he says of the small, rural town about 170 miles west of Chicago.
Fast forward a few years and Meyer is now covering the video game industry as part of the broader media and entertainment landscape, tracking its rapid growth and the trends driving it.
“Video games make up the fastest growing segment of the $1.5 trillion global media industry,” Meyer explains. “Worldwide gaming revenue rose by an estimated 11% last year and, in my view, that kind of healthy growth trajectory should continue as interactive gaming becomes a more and more popular form of mainstream entertainment.”
Mobile drives growth
Indeed, gaming is rapidly moving into the mainstream as a wide variety of games become available on mobile devices. Even some graphics-intensive games can now be played on the latest smartphones, allowing users to enjoy the experience with or without an expensive gaming console or PC. In addition, the popularity of internet-streaming games and free-to-play games has opened the market to more gamers than ever before.
“It’s no longer just 15-year-old boys playing video games in their parents’ basement,” Meyer says. “This is a big business, and it’s attracting many types of players all over the world.”
Need more data? Consider these stats:
More than 164 million adults play video games in the U.S., according to a recent report by the Entertainment Software Association, and they spent about $43 billion on game-related purchases. The average age of a U.S. gamer is 33; 54% are male and 46% are female.
China is the world’s fastest growing video game market, with sales rising about 14% a year. China has 598 million gamers and roughly 95% of them play on mobile devices, according to a study by research firm Niko Partners.
There are far more people around the world watching eSports events — online and in-person video game tournaments — than watching the Super Bowl, according to data gathered by Statistica. And much like professional athletes, contestants in eSports events can earn millions in prize money and endorsements.
Grand theft market share
In another sign of the times, the most popular video games are generating far more revenue than individual movies, books and music. Earlier this year, the video game Grand Theft Auto V became the highest-grossing entertainment product of all time. GTA V, which is routinely among the top selling titles each year, has sold more than 90 million copies since it launched six years ago, and it has generated about $6 billion in revenue.
By contrast, the highest grossing movie of all time, “Avengers: Endgame,” has earned roughly $2.79 billion worldwide since it was released in April 2019. Prior to that, 2009’s “Avatar” held the record at slightly less than that amount, or $2.78 billion.
“What fascinates me about video games, as opposed to movies, is the highly interactive nature of the content,” says Alan Wilson, a portfolio manager with Capital Group. “As a player in the game, your participation changes the content, and that makes it a much more immersive experience. It’s a very different experience than passively watching a movie. In some ways, it’s much more powerful.”

Industry leaders
Gaming is a global industry and, as such, the major players can be found throughout the U.S., Europe and Asia. They include game console-makers such as Microsoft (Xbox) and Sony (PlayStation), as well as game developers and publishers such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive. Some, like Nintendo, even do both, producing consoles and creating games featuring world-renowned intellectual property.
Here’s a brief look at the three largest companies by gaming revenue:
Tencent — Headquartered in Shenzhen, China, Tencent is a giant technology conglomerate and by far the largest gaming company in the world. It also provides internet, mobile and telecom services, among other operations. Gaming is Tencent’s largest business division, accounting for about 30% of the company’s total revenue. Tencent also has U.S. holdings, including Riot Games, maker of the online free-to-play game League of Legends. It also owns a 40% stake in Epic Games, the maker of free-to-play rival Fortnite.
Microsoft — Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is the largest gaming company in the U.S., thanks largely to its Xbox console, the main rival to Sony’s PlayStation and Nintendo’s Switch. Gaming accounts for less than 10% of Microsoft’s annual revenue, but it’s a high-profile segment of the business. The company also owns a number of popular games for the Xbox platform, including Halo, Forza and Minecraft. Later this year, Microsoft is planning to launch a cloud-based service dubbed the “Netflix of gaming,” although it will likely face several new competitors in the space, including Amazon and Google.
Activision — Based in Santa Monica, California, Activision Blizzard is one of the world’s largest video game publishers. The company has many iconic titles in its portfolio, including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Overwatch, among dozens of others. In the mobile arena, Activision’s King unit is the creator of the wildly popular smartphone game Candy Crush. Activision Blizzard was formed in 2008 through the merger of Activision and Vivendi Games.

66,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/subscription-businesses.html,Sign up for the business model of the future,Technology & Innovation,"August 29, 2019","Lather, rinse repeat. This set of simple instructions found on shampoo bottles is also proving to be, metaphorically, a sound business approach in today’s digital economy. From personal care items like shampoo and razors to streaming video and even technology, consumers and businesses are increasingly signing up for subscriptions to a widening range of goods and services.
Subscription businesses are hardly new. Americans have been signing up for newspapers and other periodicals since the Colonial era, and in the 1970s and ‘80s music lovers who subscribed to Columbia House’s mail order music service could look forward to a new record or cassette in the mail every month.
Once the purview of old-economy companies — such as makers of elevators offering lifelong service contracts, or Gillete’s approach to practically giving away razors and selling the blades — recurring revenue businesses have come into fashion with cutting edge technology companies. Digital platforms and the advent of cloud computing have added a new dimension to the subscription model by providing smart, nimble companies with three potential benefits: expand their addressable markets, provide repeatability of cash flow and deepen client loyalty.
“Companies that adopt a subscription-based model have good prospects for growth and the potential to deliver better earnings predictability and visibility,” says equity portfolio manager Alan Berro. “Earnings visibility is an important consideration for long-term investors.”
At this point in the economic cycle there is much talk about growth versus value, or U.S. versus international, but the subscription model is one that transcends all categories and represents a long-term secular trend. But not all subscription businesses flourish. Selectivity is critical. “Our fundamental research seeks to find the best of those companies, and when we find them we like to partner with them for the long term,” Berro says. “The best investments are the ones that just keep working for you.”
Here is a look at consumer- and business-focused industries where subscriptions are driving opportunity for companies and investors.
Streaming has altered the course of media consumption
Digital and mobile platforms have been at the epicenter of a seismic shift in the way people consume entertainment. These technologies helped foster the transformation from exclusively linear TV viewing to streaming media content on demand. Rather than being required to watch TV programs and movies by appointment in their living room, consumers can now receive content on their smartphones, tablets and laptops whenever they choose.
“The technology that’s now available and the infrastructure that’s in place has allowed streaming media companies to grow incredibly rapidly,” says equity investment analyst Brad Barrett, who covers U.S. media companies. Indeed, 46% of U.S. consumers polled in a 2018 McKinsey and Company report subscribed to a streaming media service such as Netflix, Hulu or Google’s YouTube.
As of June 2019, Netflix had about 60 million U.S. subscribers, triple its total in 2011. Worldwide the number increases to nearly 150 million across dozens of markets. The competitive landscape may shift again later this year as Apple and The Walt Disney Company introduce their own platforms. However, the earlier entries have what may prove to be a significant head start, Barrett notes.
“I believe Netflix — as well as Hulu, YouTube and Amazon — have gotten sophisticated in using data analytics to put the right show in front of the right person at the right time,” observes Barrett. “In the future, that will be an important core competency of the winners in streaming video.”
Streaming is also transforming the way people listen to music. Just a few years after iTunes upended the music industry with the popularization of digital downloads, listeners today have moved en masse from downloads and CDs toward services such as Spotify, Pandora, YouTube and Apple Music. As of the end of 2018, total revenues for music streaming reached $7.4 billion, accounting for more than 75% of total digital music revenue in the U.S., according to the Recording Industry Association of America.
In the cloud, opportunity for software services is sky-high
Just as mobile platforms provided a tailwind for consumer-focused businesses like Netflix and Amazon, the advent of cloud computing has already created tremendous demand for online software service providers.
The cloud is a massive network of servers that provides users with remote access to storage and computing power through the internet. In other words, rather than making major investments in their own IT infrastructure, companies can gain access to data and software applications for a fraction of the cost through the cloud. By 2022, total spending in the public cloud computing market could reach $331 billion, up from $145 billion in 2017, according to industry researcher Gartner.
Boosting efficiency, slashing IT budgets
Cloud computing has already slashed infrastructure expenditures for companies and begun to transform business models. As the movement of IT workloads to the cloud accelerates in the coming years, demand will likely rise for Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure, the current leaders in cloud infrastructure.
“Over the next decade, there will also be significant opportunity for companies focused on providing software as a service to businesses in the banking industry, in pharmaceutical and in industrials,” says equity portfolio manager Anne-Marie Peterson. “By shifting from sales of hardware and software maintenance to a subscription-based model online, many service providers are expanding their addressable markets significantly. This is disrupting established business models while driving significant opportunity for early adopters.”
Consider ServiceNow, a subscription-based software services provider that manages human resources, help desk and other IT support. ServiceNow, which describes itself as a “digital workflow company,” claims 42% of the 2,000 largest global companies among its customer base, according to Fortune’s 2018 Future 50 report.
“ServiceNow’s subscription-based cloud offering has helped it retain customers at a high rate and also expand its addressable market,” Peterson says. “Many of their customers weren’t using software before.”
Within the financial industry, enterprise software firm Temenos Group provides software services to retail, private and community banks around the world. The company, based in Geneva, Switzerland, has more than 3,000 clients in 150 countries and is increasingly shifting its business toward a cloud-based subscription model.
“Temenos is well-positioned to increase its share of banks’ IT spending,” says equity portfolio manager Jody Jonsson.
Banks, often the product of mergers, often have IT systems that can’t communicate with each other. “Whenever I meet with banks, I hear them talk about their need to modernize their technology,” Jonsson notes. “So they subscribe to a service provider like Temenos that can provide them with a complete IT solution.”
Shifting to a subscription model can pay dividends
The increasing tendency among some technology companies to reward investors with regular dividend payments has depended partly on the shift from sales to a cloud-based subscription and service model. Exhibit A is Microsoft, once the world’s leading provider of desktop software. In 2011 the company shifted toward a subscription model with the introduction of Office 365, a cloud-based offering of its productivity software that includes Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint. In addition, the company’s Azure is a top provider of cloud-based IT infrastructure.
“Microsoft has changed its business model,” explains Berro. “Today it is mostly a subscription business, and its earnings sustainability and visibility are better than they’ve ever been. As a value-oriented investor I love earnings visibility because it can help me better understand the sustainability of a company’s dividends.”

68,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/international-stocks-must-robust-portfolios.html,International stocks: A must-have for building robust portfolios,International,"July 16, 2019","International equities have lagged U.S. markets over the past decade. And with major central banks moving in a similar direction and economies increasingly interconnected, they no longer provide a high level of portfolio diversification. So why bother?
I would ask a simple question: If you go fishing, you don’t say that I’ll fish in only half the lake. It’s no different in the investing world. Why would you willingly ignore more than half of the investing universe? As someone who has invested in most markets of the world for three decades, I’ll make a few simple observations:
Some of the world’s best-run and fastest-growing companies are based outside the U.S.
A large swath of companies paying handsome dividends can be found in Europe and Asia.
The corporate culture of share buybacks, which at times results in excessive leverage on the balance sheet, is less prevalent outside the U.S., which in my view makes for more attractive long-term investments.
In order to have a well-rounded and robust portfolio of stocks, investing in international markets is a must — even if you think the U.S. market in aggregate will continue to do better in the short term. As I look out over the next few years, I see a few key themes related to investing abroad:
Looking for growth? Invest alongside the Chinese consumer.
China’s vast middle class and increasingly wealthy upper middle class will continue to be among the top drivers of global growth.
In the past decade, China was busy building out the infrastructure of its economy and, as a result, drove global demand for commodities and all things industrial. It still maintains enormous influence on the industrial economy. But what’s more interesting are the evolving tastes of the Chinese consumer. Consumption in China has grown by at least 5% a year pretty consistently over the last 10 years. It is capital expenditure and exports that have been more volatile, hence the concerns around total GDP growth.
As the population gets wealthier, their priorities are changing. For example, infant nutrition, health and hygiene have become top priorities. That’s great for a company like Reckitt Benckiser, a Dutch British multinational that specializes in baby formula Enfamil and other personal care products. French food products powerhouse Danone is capitalizing on escalating demand for yogurt and other dairy foods in China. L’Oreal is another good example. The company has overcome a slowdown in Europe’s economies by tapping into the strong demand for cosmetics in China, India and other Asian markets. It has, in fact, managed to grow revenues by around 15% year over year. If you just think of L’Oreal as a France-based company, you are missing the point and the opportunity.
We can’t ignore Chinese consumers’ fascination with luxury brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton. And in my opinion, the Europeans are the best at creating luxury brands. Kering is the French luxury goods company that owns Gucci as well as other celebrated names like Yves Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga. Focusing on the Asian consumer broadly and the Chinese consumer specifically, Kering grew top-line revenue by more than 25% in 2018 over the prior year.
In addition to following consumer demand patterns, we closely follow how corporate management is navigating these trends. Take LVMH Group, the holding company that owns, among many others, the iconic Louis Vuitton brand. The company has exhibited a highly disciplined management of its cash flow. It has redeployed much of its cash flow to expand its portfolio of brands while simultaneously pursuing a policy of growing the dividend initiated by the controlling Arnault family a dozen years ago.
Within China, I find that internet companies are nimble and responsive to changing consumer behavior. Take internet giant Tencent as an example. At the start of this decade, it took off as a very successful gaming company. It quickly identified retail as a rapidly evolving area, so it started an online retail platform. Then it recognized that electronic payments would be the next wave of evolution and started a payment platform. It is now entering a phase where it is looking at software — particularly industrial software — and management of the cloud. The company is constantly moving into the next phase of opportunity. In the context of China, it has been a phenomenal growth opportunity.
Looking for dividend income? Many technology and health care firms offer a dividend yield above 3%.
Many high-flying technology companies like Netflix and Facebook are in the U.S. But the so-called nuts and bolts of the internet are made in Europe and Asia. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (better known as TSMC) and Samsung make the majority of the world’s semiconductors. Dutch company ASML is the world’s largest supplier of lithography systems used to build semiconductors and machines used in the production of integrated circuits. Investing in stocks of these companies offers exposure to fast-growing areas of technology with a record of paying dividends, which has historically helped lower volatility and provide better downside protection in declining markets. TSMC and Samsung both have a dividend yield above 3% (as of June 30th).
Health care is another area of continuing interest for us. Europe is home to many high-quality pharmaceutical companies that are leading in immunotherapy, an area with applications ranging from treatment of various types of cancer to obesity. Roche and Novartis are the largest and most obvious; they offer the potential for capital appreciation with an attractive dividend yield above 3% (as of June 30th). But our analysts believe there are many other smaller companies with viable drugs in their pipelines.
Fundamentals matter: Europe and Asia are home to some very well-run companies.
After I have decided that I like the fundamentals of a company, I always go back to basics, which for me is that a stock’s return is capital appreciation plus the dividend. The reality today is that dividend yields are higher outside the U.S., and capital appreciation may be higher than it seems on the surface. Many companies also have a strong culture of paying dividends — they are very focused on paying the cash flow back to shareholders. When I look at operating profit rather than EPS, the growth rates of many European companies are comparable to those in the U.S.
In the U.S. there is tremendous focus on buybacks to sustain a steady growth of earnings per share (EPS). There is less focus on operating profit and organic growth. Companies are taking on debt to buy back stock. As a result, the EPS grows much faster than the operating profit. That is not a common tradition outside the U.S. Certain companies do it, but on a far smaller scale and with less frequency. And even when they do, they don't often cancel the stock, so it does not translate to EPS growth.
Companies cannot borrow indefinitely to pay dividends. Nor can they take too much of the operating cash flow to pay dividends to shareholders because that usually comes at the cost of the reinvestment cycle.
A well-balanced company is one that is able to take some of its operating cash flow, deploy it to the needs of the business and then look at other sources of growth — be it through acquisition or otherwise. At the end of the day, there should still be some cash left to service a stable but growing dividend policy. There is a discipline both to the management of the business and the capital structure. In my experience, those companies that are able to balance both tend to have very good stock price evolution over extended periods of time. And those are the companies that I look to invest in for the long term.

69,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/china-a-shares.html,China A shares: A massive market ripe for stock selection,China,"May 30, 2019","One of the world’s biggest stock markets is opening up to foreign investors. Hundreds of mainland Chinese companies, known as A shares, are being added to the benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets Index, a step toward further integrating China’s US$8 trillion stock market into global financial markets.
Trade war or not, getting China right matters. China is poised to dominate the benchmark emerging markets index, creating opportunities and challenges for investors. 
For those hoping to identify the next Alibaba or Tencent, the A-share market could be a prime hunting ground. More than 3,000 companies are listed on the country’s Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. But most A-share companies are not well-known outside of China. “I believe that creates an advantage for investors like us who’ve been on the ground talking with management to understand their businesses,” says portfolio manager Nick Grace.
Sources: MSCI, RIMES. As of 6/30/18. Chart shows MSCI China A Onshore Index sector weights as of 12/31/00, 12/31/10 and 6/30/18.
The A-share market can be complex and difficult to navigate, given its sheer size, regulatory environment and multiple corporate structures. Business choices and capital allocation decisions often depend on whether a company is state-run or private. Company leaders can be government officials or entrepreneurs whose personal ambitions may not always relate to running a company. Governance standards at Chinese companies often lag those of publicly traded firms and stock exchanges in developed markets. Trading in the A-share market is dominated by local retail investors who may be more momentum-driven and short term in focus.
All of this can make China a stock picker’s paradise. But buyer beware: “It’s a vast universe with a wide disparity in terms of the quality of companies in which to invest,” says portfolio manager Winnie Kwan.

71,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/new-perspectives-global-equities.html,New perspectives on global equities,Global Equities,"April 30, 2019","Ten years of resilient U.S. equity markets have left many investors wondering how much longer this bull can keep running. A sharp downturn in the fourth quarter of 2018 offered a glimpse into the dark eyes of a bear market, but investor sentiment quickly reversed as the Federal Reserve hit the pause button on its monetary tightening plans and U.S.-China trade tensions appeared to ease.
Since then, several key market indexes have returned to all-time highs. Where do we go from here? Can the U.S. continue to outpace other markets? When will international markets catch up? How will China’s slowing economy affect the global outlook?
New Perspective Fund portfolio manager and principal investment officer Rob Lovelace and investment director David Polak address those questions and more as the fund navigates a remarkable year of change and growth in the global equity markets.
March 9 marked the 10th anniversary of the U.S. bull market. Can it continue?
Rob Lovelace: The strong markets certainly returned with force this year, and I believe that is sustainable for a period of time. Every bull market comes to an end eventually, but right now the fundamentals remain healthy at many of the companies that have led markets higher since 2009.
In December, we ran an interesting exercise to test our conviction. With the S&P 500 Index down almost 20% — essentially bear market territory — we asked all of our equity analysts if the fundamentals had deteriorated enough to justify a 20% decline at the companies they cover. With very few exceptions, the answer they delivered was, “No.” That’s when we concluded that the fourth-quarter pullback was a buying opportunity for select companies we view as attractive long-term investments.
NPF can invest anywhere in the world, but international stocks have lagged U.S. markets by a substantial margin in recent years. How to do you address that issue?
David Polak: If you look at index returns, it’s true that the U.S. has been the best place to invest over the past decade. But a more interesting way to look at it, and the way we look at it, is on a company-by-company basis. For example, if you go back to 2009 and consider which stocks were in the top 50 each year on a total return basis, you might be surprised to find out how many of them were non-U.S. stocks.
Nearly every year of that period, most of those top 50 companies were located outside the United States. So if you had decided to ignore international equities, you would have missed a shot at many of the best opportunities. We don’t invest in countries, or regions, or economies — we invest in companies.
Why does the picture look so different on an index level?
Lovelace: It has a lot to do with the components that make up the indexes. In Europe, for example, many of the largest companies in the European indexes are financial service providers, banks in particular. Banks have not done well in recent years as weak economic growth in the eurozone and negative interest rates have hurt profitability. In contrast, many of the largest components of U.S. indexes are technology or e-commerce companies such as Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. As we all know, they’ve done quite well over the past few years.
So, looking at it simply on an index basis, the U.S. enjoys a powerful tailwind generated by a number of very strong companies on the cutting edge of technological innovation. Europe doesn’t have as many attractive companies in those areas, and the index returns reflect it. Europe has some incredible health care and luxury goods companies — including AstraZeneca, Novartis, LVMH and Kering — but it doesn’t have the equivalent of a Facebook or Netflix.
That said, I do believe international equities will reassert themselves at some point. And there are specific European multinationals in which we remain highly confident, including Airbus, in part due to its duopoly status with Boeing as the world’s two largest aircraft manufacturers and, given its dominant position as the world’s largest food company, Nestlé. Both of those companies stand to gain from a fast-growing middle class in emerging markets from China to Brazil.
U.S. equity valuations are relatively high compared to Europe, Japan and many emerging markets. Are you concerned about a valuation driven downturn in the U.S.?
Polak: I would not count out the United States. Valuation differentials aren’t as pronounced as they may seem when you consider that fast-growing non-U.S. companies are often just as highly valued as fast-growing U.S. companies. Investors place a premium on companies with strong earnings growth, innovative products and the ability to take market share from their competitors. Those types of companies command a high valuation, no matter where they are located in the world.
Overall, the U.S. premium isn’t as great as you might think when you look at comparable, growth-oriented companies in Europe and Asia. In addition, the U.S. — and to some extent China — has the technology giants Rob talked about earlier, and that can have a big impact on the overall valuation picture as well. Companies such as Amazon in the U.S. and Alibaba in China can distort that picture, given their dominant positions in the marketplace and resulting rich valuations.
China’s economic growth slowed to a nearly 30-year low at the end of 2018. Against that backdrop, what’s your outlook for Chinese equities?
Lovelace: China’s economy has been slowing for years. That’s not a new development. The government appears to be purposely limiting credit growth and other areas in an effort to avoid excesses building up in the economy. I don’t think the situation will get much worse from here.
The Chinese stock market will continue to be driven by increasing foreign investment, particularly as index providers such as MSCI add more Chinese companies into the relevant benchmarks. Many of these companies have existed in China for a long time, we just didn’t have access to them. That is changing rapidly, and it’s one of the things that keeps me excited about investing in Chinese companies over the long term.
One of the hallmarks of NPF is a concept called The New Geography of Investing®. What is it and how does it fit into your investment approach?
Polak: The New Geography of Investing is a method of evaluating companies and assessing risks based on where each company generates its revenue, rather than where it is domiciled. In the distant past, country-of-domicile was a good indicator of where a company did the lion’s share of its business. That is increasingly no longer the case. Many of the leading multinationals in the NPF portfolio are based in one country but generate far more revenue in other parts of the world.
Nestlé is an excellent example. Nestlé is based in Switzerland, but its largest sources of revenue are the U.S. and Latin America. Moreover, its most rapidly growing markets are in Asia and Africa. By these measures, Nestlé can hardly be considered a European company. It just happens to be where the company’s top executives choose to maintain their corporate headquarters.
Looking at the NPF portfolio through the New Geography lens shows us that the fund has more exposure on a revenue basis to the U.S. and emerging markets (principally China) than it does to Europe and Japan. The difference isn’t huge, but it is meaningful as a way of more accurately gauging some of the investment opportunities and risks inherent in the fund.
How has the New Geography concept evolved over the years?
Lovelace: If anything, I think it’s more important and relevant now than it has ever been. Many more companies are reporting detailed sources of revenue today as compared to five years ago, so we have even better data. In the early days we produced a lot of estimates, which we still do now for the companies that don’t break it down in their financial statements. The basic conclusions haven’t changed too much. The U.S. remains a very important source of revenue for many multinationals, but China is rapidly moving up that scale, challenging the dominance of the U.S. in many ways. I expect to see that trend continue.
Our initial thesis that country of domicile is not an effective way to evaluate companies is now far more pronounced. We used to say, half-jokingly, “You can’t invest in Europe even if you want to.” That is becoming truer today given that more than 50% of the revenue from European-based companies comes from outside Europe. As multinationals grow larger and expand into more markets, I think the investment discipline underpinning the New Geography concept should continue to serve our investors well.
In recent months, NPF has increased its exposure to the health care sector. Why?
Polak: The answer is very much about individual stock picking. This is where our focus on fundamental, bottom-up research pays off. Many of our analysts have decades of experience covering companies in this sector and elsewhere. They approach their jobs with a long-term perspective. For example, our health care analysts have been keeping an eye on the human genome project for years. They knew it had the potential to unlock innovative new drugs, but it took longer than the typical patience level of most investors.
Fast forward a few years and the science is starting to produce tangible results. Smart companies are figuring out ways to replicate these new treatments on a large scale. Small biotech firms are proving that it works in the lab, and Big Pharma is moving in via acquisitions — flexing their research and marketing muscle. Our analysts are well placed to identify these events since they’ve often been following the story from the beginning.

72,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/defensive-investing-dividends-down-markets.html,Defensive investing has paid dividends in down markets,Dividends,"April 23, 2019","The Cold War was raging, Jimmy Carter became the first candidate from the Deep South elected President since the Civil War and Apple Computer was a newly established company the year Joyce Gordon began her career at Capital Group. She started as an assistant at age 19 – the youngest employee ever hired at the firm at that time.
It didn’t take Gordon long to recognize that the investment analyst role was the job to have at Capital. “For the first couple of years I was in a clerical role, but I decided pretty quickly that I wanted to work as an investment analyst,” she recalls. “Portfolio managers depend on the analysts to provide the information they need to make investment decisions. And I really liked the camaraderie and mutual respect among the investment professionals.”
With Capital’s backing, Gordon earned her degree and then an MBA at night. In 1987 she became an analyst covering savings and loans.
“Two years later, my responsibilities expanded to include the banking sector. That was in 1989, right before the commercial real estate crisis, when the average bank lost 67% of its value over 12 months,” she says. “It was about the only group of stocks that was declining because the crisis was centered around real estate. It was a lonely existence. I remember my research director saying, ‘Joyce, you are so lucky. You’re getting five years’ experience in one year.’”
Today, Gordon is the principal investment officer and a portfolio manager for American Mutual Fund® (AMF). Since 1950, the fund has pursued three objectives — capital appreciation, current income and preservation of principal — by investing primarily in quality companies that pay dividends. Such value-oriented shares have lagged the broader market in recent years, behind a few fast-growing technology and consumer leaders. But with equity valuations elevated, market turbulence rising and the U.S. economy in late cycle, dividend-focused investing may start to attract more attention.
We sat down with Gordon to get her perspective on the current environment and lessons learned about investing through volatile markets.
The U.S. economy is firmly in late-cycle territory. How are you thinking about portfolio positioning today? Are you doing anything differently?
Now that the Federal Reserve has halted its interest rate hikes and taken a more dovish stance, I expect the decade-long U.S. expansion can continue, even though we are in the late stages of the cycle. I also feel that markets can continue to offer appreciation.
But equity markets tend to be more volatile during the late cycle. In part, that’s because order volumes start to come down — or at least level off — which increases the potential for companies to fall short of their earnings estimates. So I expect markets to be volatile going forward.
In this environment I am looking to be more defensive, focusing on established companies with a track record of generating steady revenue regardless of what is happening in the economy.
What type of companies are you looking at today that might have those qualities?
Utilities such as American Electric Power, with long-term contracts and a stable rate base, have tended to hold up well in troubled economic times. Indeed, in 2018 the utilities sector of Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index posted a 0.46% gain while the broader S&P 500 declined 6.24%.
I also look closely at defense contractors, food companies and health care companies such as AbbVie. Hormel [0.6% of the fund’s portfolio as of 3/31/19], for example, has held up better than the market during past declines, as have retailers like Costco.
These types of companies tend to have low debt levels; sometimes they are net cash. And many of them pay dividends. The longer this expansion continues, the more attention I pay to dividend sustainability. Should the company decide to cut its dividend, support for the stock price could collapse. That’s what happened with a lot of companies in the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009.
What lessons did you draw from the 2008 recession and other down markets over the course of your career?
One important lesson I learned is to avoid companies with a lot of debt. Companies with significant debt service are subject to a number of challenges. For example, they may feel pressure from credit rating agencies to cut their dividend so that they can maintain an investment-grade rating for their debt issuance.
Another thing I learned is to pay close attention to what company executives and boards are doing. Take Washington Mutual, which failed during the financial crisis in 2008. Going into the crisis, the bank issued a proxy proposal that would change its management bonus structure, removing the impact of any loan losses. In other words, management was being incentivized by volume, not quality. Looking back, that should have been a telltale sign that something horrible was coming.
I don't see a lot of those types of things going on today. But some companies are issuing debt to buy back shares and pay their dividends, rather than using free cash flow. It’s tempting for companies to do this because rates are so low, but it can be a warning sign.
I have also seen some companies that have typically increased their dividend every year that have yet to do so over the past year. And in many cases these have been the companies with a lot of leverage who are becoming concerned about paying down debt. We have seen that with some of the food companies. This suggests that sales growth is tougher in this late-cycle environment.
Are you and the other AMF managers taking a more defensive approach?
Because preservation of principal is one of the fund’s primary objectives, I am always thinking about steps I can take to help protect on the downside. Today I am holding more cash than usual; it's partly because we are so late in the economic cycle and partly because I'm getting a little nervous about valuations. While I do give up some of the market return potential, holding cash can help mitigate market volatility and, if the market corrects I have the dry powder to invest in good companies at relatively attractive valuations.
In addition, all the portfolio managers in the fund are looking through their portfolios with a fine-tooth comb. We are studying how companies have fared in previous downturns to identify a whole array of stocks that typically do well versus those that don't tend to fare so well.
It comes down to doing the fundamental research on individual companies. Over time we have constructed a backdrop of what has typically happened during recessions and the types of companies that have fared better than the broader market.
We go through all the scenarios and try to make sure that we are protecting on the downside while still participating in the market. The goal is to help our investors stay the course through difficult periods by reducing the amount of volatility in the fund.

73,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/4-reasons-semiconductors-remain-attractive.html,When the chips are down: 4 reasons semiconductors remain attractive,Technology & Innovation,"March 27, 2019","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Waning demand for computer chips is impacting the semiconductor industry.
Revenue growth cooled in mid-2018 and continues to moderate amid slowing smartphone sales.
The long-term investment outlook remains positive as more powerful chips fuel innovation.
After years of strong revenue growth and high demand for computer chips, the semiconductor industry today is reflecting its cyclical nature. Slowing global economic growth, international trade tensions and a maturing smartphone market are all contributing to a muted near-term outlook for chipmakers and designers.
The slowdown, which became evident in the second half of 2018, was entirely predictable. It followed two years of rapid growth driven by soaring demand from chip-hungry tech giants such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. However, this inevitable cool down isn’t cause for alarm, in my view.
Semiconductors lie at the heart of technological innovation and, given this, my long-term outlook for the industry remains highly optimistic. I think the current slowdown will be less severe than many industry observers are predicting, and moderate growth levels — somewhere in the mid-single digits — are likely to resume in the years ahead.
We are already seeing tentative signs of a reversal as semiconductor stocks have rallied following a rough fourth quarter. Just last week, Micron Technology reported that it expects memory chip prices to recover as demand picks up from data centers, where the shift to cloud computing remains a powerful trend.
Here are four reasons why the semiconductor industry remains an attractive hunting ground for investment opportunities, despite the volatility we’ve seen over the past few months:
1. The “Internet of Things” is still a thing.
While it’s true that demand from smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung appears to be decelerating, other types of manufacturers are continuing to ramp up the technological prowess of their own products. For instance, the average automobile these days has more than 30 computer chips, and luxury vehicles often have more than 100. In the medical device industry, adoption has been slower due to regulatory factors, but the growth potential is substantial, particularly in the field of robotic surgery.
Internet-connected consumer products are also becoming ubiquitous. At the touch of a button, Android and iPhone handsets can now control everything from home security systems to backyard sprinklers. Refrigerators can automatically order food via online delivery services before you’ve even realized you’re out of milk. All of these products require smaller and more specialized computer chips to get the job done. The “Internet of Things” is a trend that should accelerate in the years ahead.
2. The 5G revolution is coming.
The move toward 5G, or fifth generation, cellular connectivity — which is happening as you read this — may feel like an evolutionary shift at first but, in my view, it will lead to revolutionary technological advances. The limits of 4G, primarily latency due to slower speeds, will be largely eliminated. Devices will be able to “talk” to each other almost instantaneously.
Once 5G becomes widely available in the next few years, it will open up new business models that didn’t previously exist due to technological limitations. It will also boost the current technology giants as internet search, social media and e-commerce become more ingrained in our daily lives. Artificial intelligence applications and virtual reality devices will proliferate in this environment — and will require advanced chips to power innovation.
3. Industry consolidation creates dominant players.
The semiconductor industry — which includes chipmakers, designers, manufacturers and chip-equipment makers — is a standard-bearer for globalization. As such, it recently has experienced the same consolidation pressures as many other highly competitive, global industries. Mergers and acquisitions have reshaped the industry, highlighted by Avago’s $37 billion megamerger with Broadcom.
In 2003, for example, there were 25 manufacturers of logic chips. Today, following a wave of M&A activity and some timely exits, the business is dominated by three companies: U.S. giant Intel, South Korea’s Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor. In some parts of the industry, there is only one supplier, such as Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML. Used to produce the most advanced chips in the world, ASML’s extreme ultraviolet lithography machines cost upwards of $100 million.
This consolidation trend has helped to shore up profitability and position the remaining companies for a more favorable competitive environment in the years ahead.
4. Chipmakers remain a powerful force.
Yes, the semiconductor industry is maturing. The days of supercharged growth are giving way to moderate and even slow growth at times. But the industry’s technological and financial impact continues to loom large. In 2018, semiconductor companies generated global sales of $468.8 billion, a 13.7% increase over the previous year, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. The market slowed appreciably in the second half of 2018, but it was still a record sales year.
Semiconductors continue to power the technology-based resurgence that has characterized the post-financial crisis period. I see strong tailwinds for this industry, particularly with the advent of 5G and the ever-growing roster of connected devices in the world, both of which should bode well for investors with the patience to take a long-term view.

74,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/dangs-dividend-focused-companies.html,"You know the FAANGs, now meet the DANGs",Dividends,"February 21, 2019","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Market volatility came storming back last year, with so-called FAANG shares leading both the ups and downs.
Long-term prospects for many tech stocks are bright, but expect more volatility in the near term.
If you’re looking for a smoother ride, consider the “DANGs” — dividend-focused companies ― for your portfolio.
Nowhere were the market gyrations of 2018 felt more acutely than among shares of leading technology companies ― including the “FAANG” stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google owner Alphabet). Technology shares led the market both up and down. Thus far in 2019 market-leading tech and consumer companies ― and the broader market ― have recovered meaningfully.
Nevertheless, investors should keep their seat belts fastened, as a late-cycle U.S. economy, unresolved trade tensions and slower earnings growth suggest the bumpy ride may continue.
While corrections are a normal feature of healthy markets, it’s understandable that the volatility of 2018 made investors uncomfortable. Those who lost sleep last December may want to reconsider how their equity portfolios are allocated. Investments in established, dividend-paying companies can help smooth out the ride in volatile markets.
“Income-oriented stocks have not fared well over the past several years, as all of the excitement in the U.S. market has been with a very narrow group of innovative tech companies,” says equity portfolio manager Alan Berro. “But I am confident that at some point the market will recognize the value in these income-oriented stocks. And the dividends they pay offer steady return potential when markets are falling.”
The power of diversification
Indeed, some of the more defensive areas of the market that pay substantial dividends held up reasonably well in 2018. For example, the utilities sector outpaced the overall market in each of the three periods of pronounced volatility ― and despite significantly trailing the market when it was rising, utilities ended with a gain for the full year while experiencing relatively low volatility.
Yet companies across a wide range of sectors and industries are creating wealth by offering compelling products and services. A look at eight major declines, dating back to 1987, shows that many of the areas that have held up better than the broader market have paid meaningful dividends.
As an example, here is a brief look at what we’re calling the DANGs: DowDuPont, AbbVie, Nestlé and General Motors. Each from a different market sector, they represent a range of business prospects, earnings potential and challenges, but all are established blue chip companies that have paid meaningful dividends and represent potential value for long-term investors.
DowDuPont: Can 1+1 equal 3?
Chemical giant DowDuPont was formed in August 2017 via the merger of Dow Chemical and DuPont with the notion that combining the two would add up to more than the sum of its parts, thereby unlocking value for investors. Later this year it is scheduled to split into three independent companies: an agricultural business, a commodity chemicals business specializing in plastics for packaging, and a specialty chemicals business that makes Kevlar and automotive parts.
“The company is taking steps to extract cost savings from the merger before separating into three tightly focused businesses,” Berro explains. “This is complicated, but it provides a good example of how in-depth research helps us understand the potential value a company represents. Our investment analysts have really dug into this and have a good understanding of what each of the new companies will look like.”
Since the merger, the company’s shares have been under pressure from a number of external factors, including China’s slowing economy and a softening of demand for materials. “I believe once the new companies are formed, the market will begin to recognize the three represent more value than is obvious today,” Berro says. “In the meantime, the company pays a healthy dividend, so investors are essentially paid to wait.”
AbbVie: An established franchise with innovation potential
Within the health care sector, drugmakers tend to be defensive investments because demand for their therapies typically is not economically sensitive. Some innovative drugmakers also represent significant growth potential thanks to advances in biotechnology that are bringing the world closer to a cure for cancer. One such company is AbbVie, the maker of rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira®, which has invested heavily in the development of potential cancer-fighting therapies.
“The market is very concerned about pending patent expiration for Humira and the risk it presents to future earnings,” says equity portfolio manager Chris Buchbinder. “I believe the franchise is more sustainable than the market anticipates.”
AbbVie has a pipeline of potential cancer treatments. “Not only is the company growing pretty well today, I believe its future growth potential is much stronger than the market anticipates,” Buchbinder adds. “What’s more, if we go into a recession tomorrow, the outlook for AbbVie really won't change very significantly.”
Nestlé: A century old and a history of resilience
Nestlé, the Swiss maker of packaged food products including pet care, coffee and infant formula has been in business for more than 150 years. Always innovating, the company invented — among other things — instant coffee and bouillon cubes, and has been quick to recognize changing consumer tastes.
“Nestlé will never get your heart racing, but that is part of its attraction,” says investment analyst Georgios Damtsas. “The company hasn’t cut its dividend in decades, and it has demonstrated a commitment to growing its dividend over time.”
A change at the top of Nestlé may be the catalyst the company needs to return to growth. CEO Mark Schneider, the first outsider to lead the company since 1922, plans to boost growth in part by exiting less profitable businesses like processed meats, skin care and U.S. chocolate, and focusing to a greater degree on infant formula, pet care, coffee and medical nutrition products.
“The company plans to meet its target of mid-single-digit growth by 2020, regardless of economic conditions,” Damtsas adds.
General Motors: Old-line automaker ramps up innovation.
When you think of autonomous vehicles, the first name “G” that comes to mind is Google, since they are investing heavily in self-driving technology. But General Motors, a traditional, old-line firm, has made strides in self-driving technology through its acquisition of innovator Cruise Automation. As of late 2018, the company had about 180 autonomous cars undergoing testing primarily in San Francisco.
“GM is rapidly accumulating data, and I believe it could become the No. 2 player in the U.S. market for self-driving cars,” Buchbinder says. “The market seems to be pricing in somewhere between nothing and very little for the value of that business, partially because we're in a late-cycle environment and partially because of concerns over global trade. I believe GM may be well positioned to capitalize on a leading technology trend that could transform the industry over the next five to 10 years.”
Although history is not predictive of future returns, maintaining a broadly diversified equity portfolio that includes a mix of dividend-paying stocks can help mitigate volatility and provide access to potential growth across an evolving opportunity set.
“As a value-oriented investor, I look not only for the relative stability that dividends can provide, but also for the flexibility to invest in companies across sectors that offer growth potential or whose value is misperceived by the market,” Berro relates. “Very often that means investing in companies with different drivers than the fast-growing, innovative tech companies.”

Trying to time the markets probably isn’t the answer. Data from Morningstar shows that, on average, investor returns lag fund returns. A fund’s investor return includes the impact of purchases and sales of the fund. The difference between the two return measures is considered a proxy for investors’ ability to time markets. Investor returns lag because many investors chase past performance and end up buying funds too late or selling too soon. This effect is amplified in higher volatility funds, which are more prone to periods of sharp declines that could cause investors to sell prematurely and miss a subsequent rebound. Investors should consider a more disciplined, long-term approach to investing and avoid jumping from fund to fund, especially when faced with higher volatility.

Technology stocks could remain volatile for some time amid the potential for slower earnings growth at some companies and greater regulatory scrutiny.
There will likely be a dispersion of returns among the FAANG stocks, given different valuations and where they are in the earnings cycle.
The long-term outlook for many technology companies remains positive, supported by strong business models, dominant industry positioning and potential new areas of growth.
Technology and tech-related stocks have led markets on the way up and the way down in recent weeks. Volatility in technology shares remains higher than the broader market. The FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google owner Alphabet) stocks in particular have come under pressure, given their strong bull run. Are they getting de-fanged or will they be able to hold their ground?
Although we may see a period of weakness and continued volatility in some technology stocks, the fundamentals of many of these heavyweights remain solid. Don O’Neal, portfolio manager and principal investment officer of The Growth Fund of America®, says, “We are always on the lookout for massive disruptions in business models. That does not appear to be the case in the near term for these dominant companies.”
Here are four factors that managers believe will continue to characterize the technology space.
1. Expect continued tech sector volatility.
During the three periods of pronounced volatility in U.S. equity markets this year — in January, March and October — technology stocks fell harder than the overall market each time. But they also rebounded stronger than the broader market in subsequent periods. Despite the volatility, the technology sector has still delivered the highest returns year to date, gaining 11% through October 31, while the S&P 500 rose 3%. Two technology-related companies — Amazon and Netflix — have also had outsized gains, with year-to-date returns of 37% and 57%, respectively.
“In the early days of a market correction, stocks that have done the best in the recent period often come down the most. But over a long-term horizon, the outlook for these companies can continue to be strong,” O’Neal says. 
2. Amazon is a case study in investing through market volatility.
Sharp market declines are nothing new for many high-flying tech stocks. As an example, since the financial crisis of 2008, Amazon shares have declined at least 15% on 10 different occasions, and more than 30% in three different periods. But following each of the previous corrections, its shares hit new highs. Investors who could stomach short-term volatility saw big gains, whereas those who sold the stock in one of those declines missed out.
The recent slide in Amazon‘s share price has been steep. Weakness in the retail sector caught up with the company and overshadowed its progress in profitability across the entire business. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud computing unit, also slowed slightly, with revenues growing 46% in the third quarter, down from a 49% growth rate in the second quarter.
“In absolute terms, AWS’s growth rate is still very strong and it remains a growth engine for the company, accounting for more than 50% of its operating profit,” says technology analyst David Penner. “While the share price may experience some weakness in the near term, Amazon has the ability, in my view, to remain one of the strongest large companies in the world.”
3. Tech stock fundamentals continue to be strong.
During the late 1990s tech boom that peaked in early 2000, share prices of web companies outran their earnings potential, stretching valuations to unsustainable levels. This is not the case today. While some companies, including Facebook and Amazon, have struck a note of caution in recent earnings guidance, in aggregate, profits for technology companies are more in sync with their share prices. Moreover, cash balances at Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet are among the largest at any nonfinancial U.S. company.
Dominant tech companies today share many characteristics that have accelerated their growth and warded off competitors. “Two things I look for most in these companies are a wide moat and a long runway. Think Amazon in retail. Google in search. Facebook in social media. Microsoft in office productivity software. Apple in premium phones and tablets,” says Mark Casey , a portfolio manager for The Growth Fund of America.
Other factors that favor many of these companies are:
Multiple peripheral businesses that could become much larger over time, such as YouTube and Android for Google, and Instagram and WhatsApp for Facebook
Lots of cash on balance sheets
Strong founder CEOs still at the helm
Above-average organic revenue growth
The ability to attract the best talent in the industry
Yet, although they share many common traits, “The FAANG stocks are not a homogenous group,” says Chris Buchbinder, a portfolio manager for The Investment Company of America® fund. “For example, in the case of Facebook, recent weakness in the stock has been driven by regulatory concerns and company guidance with respect to both near and longer term cost pressures. At current levels, a lot of that may already be factored into the price.”
Buchbinder adds, “On the other hand, a lot of optimism about the future has been factored in the stock prices of Amazon and Netflix. I remain very positive on these companies, but do things have to be even better than the market expects for the stocks to continue to do as well as they have? Probably. I think we will see greater dispersion of returns among the FAANG stocks.”
4. Valuations are reasonable for many tech companies.
Another big difference from the dot-com period is that, as a group, these stocks don’t all trade at nosebleed valuations. Facebook and Apple trade at forward P/E ratios in the teens. Microsoft and Alphabet are priced at less than 23x consensus forward earnings. Although those valuations are richer than the broader market, it is easier to make a case that these companies can grow into those multiples. Amazon’s price-to-earnings multiple is among the highest in the group, but the company’s huge investments in the business result in more modest reported earnings.
O’Neal believes current valuation levels are reasonable, considering these companies’ higher growth potential. “In the internet bubble, that group of high-flying stocks went to extreme valuations that we had never seen before without the earnings to back them up. But now, the current crop of big technology stocks sells at premiums that are quite modest relative to the broader market. The valuations are reasonable considering the strong fundamentals and growth prospects of these companies over the next few years.
“As an example only, Facebook trades at around 20 times next year’s earnings, which is similar to other consumer-oriented stocks such as Clorox and Procter & Gamble. Which one would you rather invest in, assuming similar price-to-earnings multiples — a company growing at 0%–5% or 20%–25%?” O’Neal says.
“Over the medium to longer term, regulation could disrupt their business models. It will be a risk that could be with us through the next presidential election cycle. That said, I believe many of these companies will be able to manage their businesses despite greater regulation and scrutiny,” he adds.

But portfolio manager Noriko Chen says the causes are rooted in specific countries and offers a brighter outlook for the asset class as a whole.
View transcript
Apu Sikri: Noriko, What's driving the recent volatility in emerging markets today, and what's your outlook for the asset class? Should we expect this bumpy ride to continue?
Noriko Chen: I think that the recent volatility has been driven by a number of factors, including some weak economies, weak politics and also upcoming elections that are kind of unnerving investors. So, I think a lot of these issues are shorter term in nature, and they're also very focused on specific countries.
When you look at countries like Turkey and Argentina, the economies were mismanaged, and they have a lot of debt, and there are also political issues. So, they're very country-specific. I think when you look at other emerging markets, they don't have those types of issues.
Apu Sikri: How much of it has to do with global trade, do you think? The global trade tensions worsening?
Noriko Chen: So, I think the volatility in the market — in emerging markets — depends on the country. For China there certainly has been an impact of concern from global trade, and I think that that's resulting in corporates not being active with capex and consumers being worried. But there are other reasons why the Chinese market has been weak this year, which also includes the stock market being down significantly and lack of liquidity in the property market and property prices.
For other countries, there isn't as much of a contagion impact from Turkey and what's happening in Argentina, because there actually isn't significant trade, particularly with countries like Turkey. But I think what it has done is increase the risk premia for emerging markets. So, when people think that this can happen to these countries, they think it can happen to the others, even though I think that the other countries, including India and China, have much different fiscal situations.
Apu Sikri: Do you still think investor sentiment gets a little bit vulnerable to the talk of the asset class, even though the country fundamentals are quite different from each other?
Noriko Chen: I think so. And I think that's really what provides us the opportunity to invest in specific countries — and companies in countries. So, for example, if you look at India and China and a number of other emerging markets, they've actually reduced their current account deficits. During good times over the past several years, they've reduced subsidies. So, they've really been taking pain earlier on, so that when things happen — when the economy weakens — they're much stronger, you know; they've reduced debt. So, I think that these countries are in a much better fiscal situation than last time.
Apu Sikri: So, you're saying as the market may sell off indiscriminately, you will find areas of opportunity where you see longer term fundamentals holding up?
Noriko Chen: That’s right, yes. So, longer term, I would expect that we revert back — and it's particularly these stronger economies, emerging markets — revert back to their kind of 5% normalized growth rate.

U.S. investors seeking dividend income face certain challenges in today’s market.
Rising rates, stretched valuations and relatively modest yields present risks for dividend-focused investors.
Global markets have become fertile hunting grounds for higher-yielding stocks.
Lately, dividend investors have faced some tough sledding. Growth-oriented companies have been leading the bull market for what seems like an eternity. Yet valuations for some dividend payers in perceived safe havens of the market are elevated by historical standards. With interest rates rising, income investors may be wondering where they should turn to find dividend opportunities. Part of the answer, according to Jim Lovelace, principal investment officer and portfolio manager for Capital Income Builder®, is going global. Jim recently sat down with us to share his perspective on six key questions facing dividend investors today.
Capital Income Builder is a globally diversified equity-income fund that focuses on generating a growing stream of income that exceeds the yield paid by U.S. companies in general.
Can dividend-oriented income investors stay focused on U.S. markets, or has it become essential to take a global approach?
For an income portfolio, it's a lot easier to find opportunities when taking a global approach. The U.S. market since the tech bubble of the late '90s and the early 2000s has been one of the lower-yielding markets in the world. Today, the yield on the S&P 500 is a little less than 2%. Whereas the yield of the rest of the developed markets, using MSCI EAFE as a point of reference, is a little over 3%. So that tells you there are more yield opportunities outside the U.S. than inside the U.S.
When you go back to the 1980s, few markets were oriented toward dividends. Besides the United States, there was the United Kingdom, Australia, Hong Kong, Canada — and those were the primary markets. Over the years, companies domiciled in many countries have learned the value of having companies distribute dividends to investors. Dividends help to stabilize markets and help contribute to companies' total returns over long periods.
So now Continental Europe is one of the best markets for finding good dividend growth investments. Southeast Asia beyond Hong Kong is a very fertile market for companies that have a healthy dividend culture and strong growth. So the opportunities have really grown. As a case in point, about half of Capital Income Builder’s equity investments are in non-U.S. securities. Part of it is the relative valuation – non-U.S. markets today are much cheaper than U.S. markets. Nevertheless, it gives you a sense of the extent to which we look to international markets for meeting income objectives.
But should investors be concerned that a strengthening U.S. dollar could erode the value of their dividends from non-U.S. markets?
All companies pay their dividends out of their earnings. Whether they are paying out a strict percentage of their earnings or approximating that with a dividend policy, we have to start with the question of how stable are the cash flows that underpin the dividend? That's the essence of dividend investing. If you make an investment and the cash flows are not stable, that's when you experience a reduction in income. So the fundamental analysis as to whether a company can support the dividend always remains much more important and outweighs other factors.
Of course, we also have to factor in currency risk. Ultimately, the standard for an investment is growth of income for a U.S. dollar-based investor. If there is a risk that the currency will diminish or eliminate the dividend growth, that's not an attractive investment.
Will dividend-oriented stocks continue to lag growth stocks?
I try not to be drawn into a horse race with growth stocks. My goal in leading a strategy like Capital Income Builder is to provide an investment program that provides the potential for stable equity-like investment returns over a long period. Our primary focus is the absolute return. When times get tough and the market goes down, are we holding onto the value and not going down with the markets? That’s particularly important when you get into a late cycle period like the one we’re in today.
Do rising interest rates still matter to dividend-paying stocks?
Well, stocks overall are not necessarily always hurt by rising interest rates. It’s important to understand that the main driver for rising interest rates is strong economic activity. And that can be helpful to corporate profits. So in the early to mid-stages of an expansion, you'll see rising interest rates and rising stock prices.
It's only toward the end of a cycle, when their excess is beginning to build up and the Federal Reserve is trying to slow things down, that interest rates can have a negative impact on stock prices.
As interest rates are now coming back up to historically “normal” levels, we're seeing the overall income flow growing again. So I think that rising interest rates will help the growth of the income element of Capital Income Builder.
In what areas of the market are you finding opportunity?
We find value in most areas of the market, but they're very specific situations. Almost every industry has its higher-yielding companies, and they're higher yielding for different reasons. Some are mature businesses that have chosen to reward investors with excess cash flows. Others might be turnaround companies deemed risky by the market.
Some sectors typically associated with high-yield — utilities, telecommunications, tobacco, energy and financials — tend to be interest-rate sensitive. So we do try very hard to find opportunities in some of the other industries to diversify away from that interest-rate sensitivity. Investments in technology stocks like Microsoft and companies in the health sector like Abbvie or Amgen, all three among the fund's 10 largest holdings,1 have emerged as important areas of the market where investors can obtain dividend income and growth of income, and without the interest rate sensitivity of traditional dividend-paying stocks.
Every investment we make is evaluated on its current income and its growth potential relative to the objective of the fund: to provide an above-average yield, say 3.5%, and growth of income. Our investment analysts generate proprietary estimates of dividend growth over three years for each of the companies they cover. We plot those estimates, as well as the company’s current dividend yield, along a curve. That helps us determine whether a company is a good investment for the fund. If a stock yields substantially more than that 3.5% then maybe we don't expect any growth, or 1 to 2% would be sufficient. But if it yields 3.5%, we would expect it to grow 5%. And if it yields less than 3.5%, we'd expect it to grow 10 or 15%. So that is what makes up the portfolio: stocks on that spectrum.
How important are economic cycles to dividend-paying stocks? Where are we in the current cycle?
I'm not sure it's useful to talk about economic cycles, because the economy isn't cycling the way it used to. There was a well-defined economic cycle in the U.S. into the 1980s. But starting in the 1990s, the cycle has become less and less pronounced. A lot of that has to do with the fact that manufacturing as a percent of the overall economy has diminished. It's less than 10% of employment in the U.S.
One of the key drivers of the economic cycle was inventory cycles. Starting in the 1980s, just-in-time inventory management changed the nature of the cycle dramatically. The growth of the service sector and technology also accentuated that. What we see today are different industries having their own cycles to whatever their key driver is. We still have recessions from time to time, but the last couple have been driven more by financial matters than manufacturing issues. And those will happen when there is some excess that needs to be corrected for. But that's not a cycle, that's a reaction.

EM equities have been hurt by country-specific risks, dollar strength and global trade uncertainties.
Investors should expect continued volatility in EM as U.S. rates rise, trade tensions escalate and the political scene worsens in some countries.
Despite macro uncertainty, the outlook for corporate earnings remains strong with aggregate profits projected to grow by double-digits in 2019.
We see investment opportunities in companies in Asia-Pacific and India, which are benefiting from technological change and economic growth.
Emerging markets have hit a rough patch, with the benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets Index declining roughly 16% since hitting a two-year high on Jan. 26. The pullback is not a surprise, given the substantial 93% gain over a two-year period that stretched from January 2016 to January 2018.
Political uncertainty and economic turmoil in Brazil, Turkey and Argentina, which are large borrowers in international financial markets, have dragged markets lower at times. On the positive side, corporate profitability continues to be solid, especially for new economy companies in the technology and consumer discretionary segments. Nevertheless, volatility likely will continue as markets search for a new equilibrium. 
Emerging markets: Old vs new
Even as we discuss the asset class broadly, it’s good to remember that emerging markets are a collection of very diverse countries at varying stages of economic maturity and political stability. We see two sides of emerging markets: one more defined by innovation and economic stability, and another that continues to be plagued by cyclical swings tied to commodity-related industries and political uncertainty.
The balance of power has shifted to Asian technology and consumer discretionary companies, some of which are now the biggest components of the MSCI EM Index. Mainland-listed Chinese companies, known as A-shares, are being added to the index. And India, now more business-friendly after a series of reforms, has surpassed China as the world’s fastest-growing economy.  
“Some of the risks we see in emerging markets have more to do with country-specific and macro-oriented issues and less to do with certain pockets of the Asia-Pacific and India, where our managers believe there are attractive, long-term opportunities to invest in companies benefiting from technological disruption and secular growth,” says Kent Chan, a Capital Group investment director and emerging markets specialist.
It’s also important to remember that this recent selloff comes after a long period of impressive gains, and it appears profit-taking is among the factors contributing to weaker sentiment.
The EM-dollar relationship
A stronger dollar is making conditions difficult in emerging markets and has contributed to some capital flight. Historically, long periods of dollar strength have been a headwind for emerging markets, especially in cases where countries have relied on dollar-denominated debt for financing needs.
After weakening against several foreign currencies last year, the dollar’s rebound has been driven by the relative strength of the U.S. economy compared with Europe, expected U.S. rate hikes, stronger-than-expected earnings from U.S. corporations and increased uncertainty around trade tariffs.
Will emerging markets see any relief? Capital Group currency analyst Jens Søndergaard says further gains for the dollar may be hard to come by.
“For the dollar to rally further you need markets to start pricing even more Fed rate hikes than what’s already priced. That requires the current strong U.S. growth momentum to continue into 2019. It could happen but given the current trade war uncertainties, and signs of slower global growth ahead, I think we are now at peak U.S. growth,” Søndergaard says.
China’s slowdown
China’s economy in the second quarter grew at its slowest pace since 2016. Expect a gradual slowdown over the next six months and into next year, according to Capital Group’s China economist Stephen Green.
“Moves by the Chinese government to curb risks in the country’s financial system, and ongoing global trade tensions, should contribute to the deceleration,” Green says. “Deleveraging remains a priority in Beijing. While authorities are loosening up financing for infrastructure projects and encouraging banks to lend, I don’t think it changes the situation much in the near term. We may not see a stronger policy response in terms of stimulus until next year when more signs of the economic slowdown build up.”
Though it is slowing, China’s economy is still one of the fastest-growing in the world: Its sheer size, growing tech centers and increasing wealth mean there will always be pockets of opportunity for investors.
Portfolio managers in New World Fund® (NWF), and EuroPacific Growth Fund® have been focused on companies involved in internet-connected platforms, financial services, entertainment and travel. These include Hong Kong-listed insurer AIA Group, which has been seeing increased business in China; Alibaba Group, the world’s largest e-commerce business; and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, a contract-chip manufacturer for Chinese mobile phone companies, which were all top 10 holdings in both funds as of July 31, 2018.*
They’ve also selectively invested in companies that may benefit from the government’s focus on curbing pollution and creating national champions in the health care sector.
EM fundamentals look attractive
Despite recent volatility, emerging markets could gain support from a combination of factors.
Corporate profitability and debt measures are stronger and improving. Valuations for emerging markets stocks are trading below their 10-year average on a price-to-earnings basis, and the discount has widened recently. At the same time, aggregate profits for companies in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index are estimated to rise by 16% this year and 11% in 2019 on a year-over-year basis, according to estimates by data aggregator FactSet.
Selectivity is key, according to Chan.
“While we follow the macro developments closely, we invest bottom-up in companies that we believe can continue to grow despite geo-political uncertainty, risks of trade barriers and/or economic slowing, he says. “Furthermore, valuations, in some cases, have become even more compelling for companies that we believe have long growth runways as recent volatility is creating more opportunities to invest with our longer-term view.”

84,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/small-cap-investing.html,Small-cap outlook: How and why to invest in small-cap stocks,Asset Allocation,"August 15, 2018","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Small-cap stocks continued to deliver solid results this year.
Tax reform and shelter from tariffs have lifted small U.S. companies’ shares.
A strategic approach to small-cap stocks can be beneficial for portfolios.
Investors watching the powerful rally in small-cap stocks are probably asking themselves the same question: Did I miss it?
Shares of smaller companies have delivered solid results this year. The Russell 2000 small-cap index is up 8.8% through July 31, outpacing the 5.3% gain by the large-cap Russell 1000 index. It’s a significant trend not seen since 2016 because large-cap stocks — especially in the technology sector — dominated markets last year.
What’s driving small caps?
Several macro factors are playing to the advantage of small companies, which are drawing more investor attention, says Greg Wendt, a portfolio manager and analyst at Capital Group, including on the SMALLCAP World Fund®. These factors include:
1. Greater domestic focus
U.S. small-company shares delivered better results than global small-caps and U.S. large caps in part because they rely much less on global trade, Wendt says. These companies in 2018 have been somewhat shielded from tough talk on trade and tariffs between the U.S. and other nations. “They are more protected from the trade rhetoric,” he says.
Small U.S. companies garner 80% of their revenue domestically, compared with the roughly 60% of revenue that comes from the U.S. for larger firms. Capital Group defines small-cap companies as those with market capitalizations of $6 billion or less, based on the most recent prospectus of SMALLCAP World Fund.
2. Strong interest from investors and companies
Large companies looking for a quick way to address a new market have been aggressively buying smaller firms. Global merger and acquisition activity surged 57% to $2.49 trillion, the highest level since the first half of 2007, according to Dealogic. Large companies looking to grow often find that buying smaller firms with interesting products or those that address a lucrative market is the fastest solution, Wendt says
Meanwhile, the supply of small companies going public continues to proliferate, underscoring the sector’s growth promise to investors. Already this year, 127 companies have sold shares to the public, up 42.7% from the same period last year and on pace to be the busiest year for new issues since at least 2014, according to Renaissance Capital. 
3. Tax reform
Efforts to lower tax rates for companies may benefit smaller firms more than larger ones because they typically pay higher rates. Companies in the Russell 2000 paid an effective tax rate of 31.9%, compared with the 28% effective tax rate of larger companies in the S&amp;P 500, according to a September 2017 analysis by Reuters. Large firms kept their tax rates down in part by shifting revenue and cash to countries with lower tax rates, a strategy not usually available to small firms, Wendt says.
Have I missed the rally?
The key question isn’t whether the small-cap rally can continue, but whether investors are positioned to take advantage of the sector’s long-term opportunity.
Smaller companies can continue to create value by being nimble and innovative, says Sujit Chakravarthy, a Capital Group analyst. Innovation is present across sectors and takes various forms: from technological advances in biotech to process improvement in industrials and data-driven customer targeting in financial services. Creating a competitive advantage through innovation can help small-cap companies grow irrespective of macro events.
Identifying these opportunities requires research. One important aspect of small-cap investing is finding acorns that can grow into oak trees, says Peter Eliot, portfolio manager at Capital Group. “By turning over a lot of rocks, we have managed to find several excellent companies early in their life cycles,” he says. “We look for young companies with large market opportunities, outstanding management teams and high-quality businesses and then follow them closely as they grow.”
These opportunities have emerged across a variety of industries and geographies, including healthcare, consumer, software, tech hardware, industrials and banks. The largest equity holdings of U.S.-based companies in SMALLCAP World Fund include health-care administrative services provider Molina Healthcare, online communications services provider RingCentral and gene therapy developer Bluebird Bio. Molina, RingCentral and Bluebird Bio accounted for 1%, 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively, of SMALLCAP World Fund’s assets as of July 31, 2018.
Interest in small-cap companies has driven valuations higher. The Russell 2000 is trading at 23 times what the companies are expected to earn this year, which is at the high end of its historic range, so this higher valuation level is not to be ignored, Eliot says. But investors can still find opportunities.
""It still comes down to looking for those future oak trees,” he says.
Small cap’s role in your portfolio
Small-cap stocks may offer large returns for investors, but not without risk. Of the thousands of publicly traded small companies, many will never deliver on the hopes of their founders and investors. Some may never launch their product. Others may be trampled by larger rivals or lose out to more fleet-footed companies.
That’s why investors looking at small-cap stocks may want to consider a few ways to approach the market:
1. Be strategic.
An allocation to small-cap stocks is a key component of a well-diversified portfolio. Small-cap stocks tend to be volatile in the short term, so investors should commit to them for at least a decade, Wendt says. “The way you protect yourself from the volatility is to be a long-term investor with at least a 10-year horizon.”
Data bears this out. The small-cap Russell 2000’s 8.9% average trailing 10-year return outstripped the 8.4% return of the large-cap Russell 1000 during the same period. During the trailing 20-year period, small caps pulled ahead even more: 7.2% to 5%. That’s even though large company stocks have topped small cap ones only about half the time over the past 30 years. 
2. Be selective.
Find the disruptors.* *Not all small companies will grow up to dominate, such as Netflix did, but some will and they often are the ones that make a small-company portfolio successful. Finding small companies that can grow to be big ones requires extensive research since many of the companies are not widely followed or even known. Capital Group analysts and portfolio managers travel the globe looking for unique companies with breakthrough technology.
Some industries present better opportunities than reflected in indexes, Chakravarthy says. Biotech and software are two fields with some promising companies. Deep, fundamental research can help uncover investment opportunities in small companies that may be underrepresented in the index but can grow to be much larger over time.
3. Be diversified.
Given that small-caps are more volatile, they should be part of most portfolios but not the “core anchor tenant of an overall diversified retirement-focused investment strategy,” Eliot says.
More risk-tolerant investors should work with their financial advisors to determine whether an allocation to small-cap stocks is appropriate for them. Capital Group’s Global Growth and Growth models hold 10% allocations in the SMALLCAP World fund. But even less aggressive investors can benefit from holdings in small-cap stocks. The chart below shows a breakdown of how Capital Group’s model portfolios are exposed to small-cap stocks as a percentage of their overall equity allocations.
What’s more, investors can add another layer of diversification by owning non-U.S. small companies, Wendt says. U.S. and non-U.S. small-cap cycles are not correlated, so investing in both may offer additional portfolio advantages.
Some of today’s small-cap companies have the potential to grow into large ones, sometimes very quickly. “It’s interesting when a small company becomes a big company,” Wendt says. “Where you can take something and continue to grow it, those are the areas that interest me.”

The reality is that over the years, globalization has increased trade and capital flows across economies, resulting in global financial markets that are highly correlated. Look no further than the bouts of market volatility we’ve experienced this year: Global markets from the U.S. to Asia have sold off in tandem.
This raises several questions: Why are correlations so high? Should investors care? And more importantly, what can investors do in response?
Why are correlations so high?
Three primary reasons: trade policies, capital flows and multinational corporations. 
Well-orchestrated trade policy changes designed to foster global integration have played a major role in rising market correlations. We can trace this to the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs that kicked off in 1986 and culminated in the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1995.
During this period, there were three other major trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement between the U.S. and Canada in 1988, which expanded to include Mexico in 1994. These developments had a profound impact on global trade.
Academic research shows that the number of preferential trade agreements went from 42 in 1990 to almost 280 by 2016, and average global tariffs decreased from 22% to less than 10% over the same period. Global trade surged as trade barriers decreased, with the ratio of global trade to GDP increasing by more than 50% over the same period and sharply accelerating in the 1990s.
There was also a wave of financial liberalization that increased cross-border capital flows. Capital controls fell in developed markets and a number of stock markets opened in emerging markets. Foreign direct investment — controlling stakes with greater than 10% ownership in foreign entities —grew by over 250% from 1990 to 2016 as a percentage of GDP.
As the chart shows, correlations began to rise in the mid-1990s and have stayed consistently elevated in both normal and stressed financial markets; this includes the dot-com bust in the early 2000s and the 2008 global financial crisis that spurred quantitative easing policies pursued by major central banks.
Lastly, multinational corporations have emerged as a powerful business force and represent a powerful vested interest in support of globalization.
In a 2017 report, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development estimated that the total assets of multinational corporations' foreign affiliates grew from $4.6 trillion to $113 trillion between 1990 and 2016. Foreign affiliates alone employed 82 million individuals and produced roughly 11% of global GDP.
Why should investors pay attention?
Despite protectionist rhetoric, the depth of global financial linkages and the dominance of multinational companies today suggest that globalization is unlikely to reverse substantially in the near term.
International investing has traditionally been seen as a source of diversification and risk mitigation for U.S. investors. That’s no longer the case. Our research suggests that the automatic risk reduction from including international equities has greatly weakened as correlations have increased in the wake of more trade and capital flows across economies.
This chart shows that historically U.S. investors could simply reduce the risk of the portfolios by allocating a slice of their portfolio to companies domiciled outside the U.S. 
For example, a portfolio with 40% in international equities had approximately 1.5% lower volatility than an all U.S.-equity portfolio, and lower losses in down months. This diversification profile however flattens quite significantly over the last 20 years.
While the chart demonstrates that diversification benefits may have declined, it does not mean that investors should ignore international markets completely. Rather, they may need to look at the role of international investing differently.
First, the key benefit of including international equities is in expanding the opportunity set. Over half the market capitalization of listed companies is outside the U.S. While the U.S. may seem to have a diversified mix of sectors, U.S. companies make up less than half of the global market capitalization in sectors such as telecommunication services, materials and financials.
Second, flexibility to invest across borders can lead to better results, as the chart below shows. Our research finds that the top quartile global funds tracked by Morningstar exceeded the average annualized return of the S&P 500 by 290 basis points, and the MSCI World Index by 400 basis points for the 20-year period ended December 31, 2017. 
Not only that, they also matched (and slightly outpaced) the returns of the top quartile U.S.-equity funds, despite significant headwinds to international equities in aggregate, demonstrating that above-average stock pickers who use a bottom-up style may be able to capture the value of global opportunities.
What can investors do?
As correlations remain high, it seems only prudent for investors to work with their advisors to evaluate strategies for a globalized world, assuming integrated markets are here to stay.
Here are some key suggestions:
Right-size your international equity exposure. International companies make up a significant part of the global opportunity set, and most investors are still underallocated.
Ask your advisor if you should add some global flexibility to your portfolio.
Understand how your asset manager is investing in international markets: is it fundamental, bottom-up active management, is it passive indexing or is it a top-down asset allocation fund?

In 2017, technology share prices surged like true growth investments, but with a smooth trajectory of returns. 2018 brought bouts of volatility back to the market, hitting tech companies as hard as any. Higher valuations coupled with regulatory concerns have caused swings in the sector, which has had the highest standard deviation — a common proxy for portfolio risk — in the S&P 500 this year. Investors who stayed invested have been rewarded though, as the sector has also had the highest year-to-date returns.

Investors should consider shifting a higher percentage of their assets to international stocks.
Going outside the U.S. provides a broader opportunity set and potential currency benefits.
Try combining a dedicated international strategy with a more flexible approach.
Investing in international equities can be compared to a daily exercise routine: Most people agree it’s a good idea, but quite a few don’t follow through on the concept. Thus, at a time when international equity markets account for roughly 50% of the investable universe, many U.S. investors remain woefully under-exposed to non-U.S. assets, including European, Asian and emerging markets equities.
Additionally, investors who have not dutifully rebalanced portfolios during a long bull market in U.S. equities may also find themselves inadvertently concentrated. Strong U.S. returns have encouraged that trend. This type of home-market bias can be tempting when U.S. markets are rallying, but it robs investors of a broader opportunity set that may be more rewarding over the long term.
So, when it comes to answering the question “How much international equity do you need?” — the detailed answer will vary by individual circumstance, but for many investors, the simple answer may be: “More.”
Why consider international stocks?
With U.S. equity markets reaching record highs in January 2018, valuations appear to be more attractive in non-U.S. markets. Currency tailwinds are also building as the dollar has since weakened significantly from its peak in early 2017. Capital Group currency analyst Jens Søndergaard believes this dollar-weakening trend will continue for at least the next two years, providing a nice tailwind for U.S.-based investors in international stocks.
But the most important reason to invest internationally is that many dominant, innovative companies don’t call America home. For example, some of the most successful companies in the computer-chip industry are found in Europe and Asia — including chip-equipment maker ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, a key supplier for Apple and Samsung smartphones. Samsung itself is headquartered in South Korea.
The world’s largest food company, Nestlé, is based in Switzerland. High-end luxury goods are dominated by European conglomerates such as LVMH, Kering and Richemont while Japan is renowned for its cutting-edge robotics firms, including Fanuc and Yaskawa. Broadening the definition to include emerging markets, three of the world’s biggest internet companies — Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent — are located in China. In the dirt-and-shovels sector, Brazilian mining company Vale is the largest producer of iron ore in the world. These types of global champions are making international borders less important from an investment perspective.
How much international equity?
Returning to the initial question: how much international equity do you need? There is, of course, no simple or universal answer. Individual circumstances — including risk tolerance, investment objectives and time horizon — should determine the answer, ideally in consultation with a financial advisor.
An objective-based approach to portfolio construction can help. At Capital Group, we developed 13 objective-based model portfolios covering a range of investment goals. These models are built by our Portfolio Oversight Committee, a team of seven veteran portfolio managers on a number of equity, fixed income and multi-asset funds. Almost half of the model portfolios have an international allocation of 25% or higher — significantly more than the 14% of overall assets in international funds and ETFs.
What kind of international equity?
Once the amount of international equity exposure is determined, it’s time to develop a framework for that portion of the portfolio. Again, it depends on individual circumstances, but one effective approach is to combine a dedicated international allocation with a more flexible global strategy.  A key difference between the two is indicated by the primary benchmark used to measure investment results.
Ten years ago, it was common practice to use MSCI EAFE as the primary international benchmark. But as markets and companies have become more global and with the rise of emerging markets, it may be more effective to use the MSCI All Country World ex USA Index, which reflects the returns of more than 40 developed and developing country stock markets.
Once the core allocation is set, consider adding exposure to a more flexible strategy — for example, a global fund that can ramp up or down international exposure, depending on the managers’ outlook and bottom-up fundamental research. The benchmark here would be the MSCI World Index, which is heavily weighted toward developed-market stocks, or the MSCI All Country World Index, which is similar but also includes some exposure to emerging markets.
The combination of a dedicated core international fund with a portion allotted to a more flexible global strategy can be an effective way to gain exposure to opportunities outside the U.S. while helping investors pursue their long-term goals.

90,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/portfolio-makeover.html,Portfolio makeover: 3 lessons from hundreds of portfolio reviews,Asset Allocation,"May 9, 2018","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Capital Group’s portfolio evaluation services analyze hundreds of portfolios per year.
We saw three common patterns – potential overexposure to US equity, “hidden” risk embedded in bond portfolios and recency bias in manager selection.
Addressing these issues could improve portfolio outcomes.
When you’ve seen as many portfolios as we have, you start noticing things – like the value of a good pair of glasses. We’ve studied hundreds of portfolios over the past year as part of our various portfolio evaluation services, ranging from an online Portfolio Analyzer tool to a more formal portfolio review process we call the Portfolio Perspectives Review.
This is a service we offer to financial professionals to help them identify potential enhancements to their portfolios. It’s a rigorous analysis built on principles of objective-based investing, global diversification and the roles of fixed income.
Three patterns kept appearing in our analyses, regardless of the type of advisor that created the portfolio or the type of client for whom it was created. And we believe there are straightforward ways to address those issues and potentially improve portfolio outcomes in the process.
Here’s what we found:
Issue 1: Overexposure to U.S. stocks
We frequently found portfolios were heavily tilted toward U.S. equities at the expense of international equities. The majority of portfolios we reviewed had less than 20% allocated to non-U.S. equities, which is low compared to many of American Funds’ model portfolios. It’s only natural to see this trend given the strong run of U.S. equities versus other regions from mid-2014 to mid-2017.
Sticking with international diversification has been difficult for investors as the U.S. delivered better results for years. Yet, markets reminded investors of the importance of global diversification in 2017. Last year, European and Japanese stocks delivered results that beat U.S. markets, rising 26% and 24%, respectively, on a U.S. dollar basis, topping the 22% gain by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Emerging markets rose 37%. Investors who maintained broad international diversification would have been rewarded for their patience.
Action: Rebalance toward international equities
International diversification is as valid as ever and maintaining exposure to international stocks could give portfolios broader exposure to equities with lower valuation multiples than those in the U.S. There is also the benefit of reducing country-specific risk. American Funds’ model portfolios, built by our Portfolio Oversight Committee, show non-U.S. equity weightings in the mid-20s percentage for several of our moderate portfolios. 
These models are objective-based, built through strategic allocations to investment objectives, rather than top-down asset allocation models. Capital Group models aim to meet client objectives using a blend of funds with flexible mandates.
Case study
One portfolio we examined in November, submitted by a wealth management advisor with an insurance company in the Midwest, was typical of what we’ve seen. This portfolio had 32.6% exposure to U.S. equity and just 17.4% to non-U.S. equity. Our suggestion was to rebalance the portfolio by decreasing the U.S. equity portion down to 31% and raising the non-U.S. equity slice up to 22.2%. The analysis confirmed much of the rest of portfolio was diversified. The rebalance also resulted in a smaller allocation to fixed income. 
Issue 2: Excessive risk in the bond portfolio
Many advisors did not realize how much potential risk was lurking in their bond portfolios. One of fixed income’s key roles is to provide diversification from equities. Yet, many of the portfolios we studied held bonds that were closely correlated to equities, namely high-yield bonds. Although bonds with low credit quality have rewarded investors with higher yields for years, these portfolios might be subject to greater-than-expected volatility when the equity market is disrupted.
Action: Upgrade to a “true core” bond portfolio.
Upgrade your bond portfolio with allocations that aim to lower correlations to equities and reduce the amount of low-quality credit in the portfolio. We saw portfolios with five-year correlations between fixed income and equity of upwards of 70%. We believe those correlations should be much closer to zero — as fixed income should offer a cushion during periods of equity volatility. Part of the solution could be adding or substituting with a “true core” bond strategy, or one that aims for both solid income and diversification from equities.
Case study
An advisor from a large independent advisory firm with more than $40 billion in assets under management submitted a portfolio in November with more than a third of its weighting in fixed income, as it was designed to offer stability for conservative clients. But just 62% of the fixed income portfolio was in investment grade securities (BBB rated and higher). That presented an opportunity to increase the quality of the bond portfolio to 96% in investment grade bonds.  
Issue 3: Overreliance on recent results when selecting managers
We found some recency bias in manager selection in many portfolios. For instance, portfolios often overemphasized funds with managers with solid three-year records, but underweighted those who have performed better over a decade or longer.
Many also didn’t place enough emphasis on two key screens – low fees and “skin in the game.” We’ve found “skin in the game” to be meaningful – in other words, funds with the highest manager ownership at the firm level. To get at this, we look at the percentage of the fund firm’s managers with personally invested assets of more than $1 million in the funds they help manage.
Additionally, low fees are critical across asset classes. Although portfolios often hold or advisors tended to choose low-expense options for large U.S. equity funds and core bonds, the filter didn’t apply in other areas. For small caps and flexible fixed income funds, many allocations tilted toward funds with expense ratios of 140 basis points or higher. Owning such high-cost funds drowned out the savings from the lower-cost options elsewhere in the portfolio and resulted in a higher total cost than needed.
Action: Select funds with low fees and high manager ownership.  
Consider screening for funds with lowest-quartile expenses and highest-quartile manager ownership. Although a past track record of results is a meaningful check, investors must consider if the results are repeatable. Capital Group research finds that equity funds featuring both low expenses and high ownership by fund managers have on average tended to outpace indexes more frequently.
Case study
An advisor from a large New England firm showed us a portfolio with a large growth fund, U.S. high-yield bond fund and U.S. technology fund with net expense ratios of 0.89%, 0.92% and 1.23%, respectively. That placed the funds roughly in the midpoint of expense ratios for their categories. Meanwhile, just 59% of the managers at the U.S. technology fund firm had $1 million or more personally invested in the fund. The level of manager ownership was even lower at the large growth and U.S. high-yield funds in this example. These funds could be replaced with lower expense options from firms with higher portfolio manager ownership. Making these adjustments would have brought the portfolio’s expense ratio down to 0.66% from 0.78%.

Market volatility was near record lows in 2017, but uncertainty has returned this year. Trying to time markets by indiscriminately selling equities is rarely a winning strategy, but portfolio protection with income-producing assets could be. Historically, dividend payers have tended to outpace low-yielding companies during market downturns, since dividends are seen as a steadier and more predictable source of returns than price appreciation. In fact, returns from the four highest-yielding sectors tended to beat the market during the last seven S&P 500 corrections of 15% or more. Traditionally volatile sectors such as consumer discretionary and technology should not be ignored though, as they include market leaders that have exhibited strong earnings power.

In early 2018, there’s no sign that the momentum the U.S. economy built late last year is dissipating: The labor market continues to improve, tax cuts are in effect and global demand is healthy. These factors are helping to support U.S. consumer spending growth, which has been strengthening in recent months. Although many areas of the market stand to benefit from greater consumer spending, consumer staples stocks may lag the broader market. Historically, when consumer spending growth has accelerated, the consumer staples sector has lagged the S&P 500 due to the presence of lower-growth, less economically sensitive companies in the sector. Fundamental research may help investors identify select companies in the consumer staples sector with the opportunity to generate better-than-market returns.

95,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/tech-attractive-despite-decline.html,Technology sector remains attractive despite recent steep decline,Technology & Innovation,"April 4, 2018","With technology stocks down about 10% since mid-March, some investors are reassessing the previously high-flying sector. After leading global equity markets to record highs in recent years, many tech giants are now facing intense regulatory scrutiny, rising trade tensions with China and renewed concerns over valuations.
In this interview, Capital Group technology analyst Irfan Furniturewala shares his long-term outlook on the sector, his view on current valuations and his thoughts on some of the recent challenges facing the so-called FAANG stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet.
What’s your outlook on the technology sector, given recent news events that have taken the sheen off some of the biggest and best-known companies?
There is no doubt that technology valuations are high, especially relative to the rest of the market. But many of the big tech stocks, or tech-related stocks — such as Facebook, Amazon and Netflix — have much better growth prospects and have been able to support these higher valuations.
Now with greater regulatory scrutiny and a serious trade dispute with China, the market is questioning the high-growth prospects that have been baked into the valuations of some of these companies. As a result, we are seeing a rise in market volatility led by technology stocks. Questions over the viability of cross-border mergers-and-acquisitions in light of the quashed deal between chipmakers Broadcom and Qualcomm further raise concerns around the scale advantage that dominant technology platforms typically enjoy.
Given the recent controversy over the improper sharing of personal data at Facebook, do you think “Big Data” companies such as Facebook and Google will be hit with new government regulations?
Yes, I think that’s a likely outcome. Until this episode with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, the fear that there may be greater regulatory scrutiny of Big Data companies was more nebulous. We now have a real-world case where this outside firm gained access to private information on some 50 million Facebook users. Now the issue has become very real, and we may see greater scrutiny of Big Data companies in countries around the world. These companies always had a barrier to entry in China and now they may face some obstacles in other countries, as well.
One could argue that Facebook was a little bit late to the apology table. But the company is now admitting that it made a mistake and it’s vowing to change its policies and procedures, and I think that’s the right approach. Sharing of customer data is a very sensitive topic, but I think they will find a way to resolve the issue, or Congress may resolve it for them.
It may actually be a good thing to establish some new rules governing how these companies can gather and share information about their customers. When it’s all said and done, I don’t think it will hurt the profitability of Facebook or Google in any meaningful way, and it may help to restore the trust of some customers who are rightfully upset about the improper use of their personal data.
Despite these challenges, the big data companies — be it in search or social media — provide critical services. They are like modern day utilities. Take Facebook. At the end of the day, what makes that company so successful is that it provides an incredibly valuable service, keeping people connected with friends and loved-ones in real time over the largest social network in the world. The ad revenue monetization is also seamless. When you scroll through it with your thumb on the phone, the ads are just part of the experience. The same holds true for its other assets — Instagram and WhatsApp. So, long-term, I continue to believe that these are very viable companies with long runways for growth.
Let’s talk about Singapore-based chipmaker Broadcom’s takeover bid of U.S.-based Qualcomm, which was aborted on objections from the U.S. administration. What does it mean for future mergers?
With this transaction, you have seen the U.S. identify a national champion of sorts in Qualcomm. There are certain industries that are sensitive given the information they can control or their critical nature in defense and other systems. The semiconductor industry is one such area. Given how preemptive the U.S. has been on this merger, it is quite likely that we will not see much cross-border M&A for a while.
It’s been over 18 months that Qualcomm has been waiting for regulatory clearances from about 10 countries related to its acquisition of another chipmaker, NXP, based in Europe. While all other regions, such as the EU, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have given their clearances, China hasn’t yet cleared this acquisition. Given these types of difficulties and the elongated timeline, I think we will see far less cross-border M&A going forward.
You mentioned the trade dispute with China. How big of a challenge is that for the technology sector?
At this stage, a lot depends on how China responds. Rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China represent a real threat, especially for hardware companies and less so for the semiconductor companies. Many of them are highly exposed to China, since much of the supply chain flows through that part of the world.
For Apple, about 20% of the company’s revenues come from China, and many of Apple’s products are built there. Apple’s main supplier, Foxconn, employs more than 1 million people in China. So the inter-linkages are quite substantial.
To an extent, open borders are important. For many technology companies — and taking Apple as an example — the business models are built on scale. Build once and sell the same product worldwide in volume. If the markets get fragmented, and the product you sell in the U.S. is different from the product in China, which is different from the product in India, then you lose that scale and the incentive to invest back so much in research and development. That is what the market is grappling with.
So far, we’ve seen the U.S. impose billions of dollars in tariffs aimed at China, and China has responded in kind, targeting U.S. products. We’ll just have to watch and see how it plays out.
Do you view this volatile period as an opportunity to buy shares at more attractive valuations?
Oftentimes, I do see these difficult periods as buying opportunities, although each investment decision must be judged on a company-by-company basis. While valuations in this sector are always a concern, in my view, they are not excessively high. In fact, they are nowhere near the nose-bleed levels we saw in the late 1990s — and the big difference now is, the earnings are coming through quite nicely.
The technology leaders, especially the FAANGS, absolutely dominate their respective industries. They have earned their leading positions. They have decimated the competition. They attract the best talent from all over the world. Their R&D engines are full-throttle and humming. And they have very strong balance sheets that are the result of their amazingly innovative business models. So, I expect earnings to continue to accrue to these companies and these are the types of companies that I want to invest in over the long term. Many of them offer the growth potential and the dominance to justify the valuations. The long-term runway looks very attractive, in my view. 
Until very recently, Amazon had held up better than other tech-related stocks during this downturn. Why do you think that was the case?
If you consider the two big issues right now — regulatory risk and China trade risk — Amazon is less exposed to both of those. Amazon does not monetize its user data in the same way as some of the other internet companies and so it is more difficult for the U.S. government to regulate Amazon’s business. And since Amazon does not have much business in China, any sort of escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions doesn’t really mean much for the e-commerce giant. Having said that, President Trump has tweeted about Amazon avoiding taxes, taking advantage of the U.S. Postal Service and causing store closures all over the country. In recent days, this has created weakness in Amazon’s stock.
Growth stocks have outpaced value stocks by a wide margin in recent years. Do you see that changing anytime soon?
In my view, we are still in the sweet spot of the economic cycle. We are experiencing synchronized growth in most of the world’s major economies. Interest rates are still very low by historical standards. While the Federal Reserve is raising rates, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan don’t appear to be in any hurry to catch up. So, given this favorable environment, I think there is a long runway for growth.

98,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/chairman-on-indexing.html,Tim Armour weighs in on indexing,Active Management,"February 24, 2018","The idea that investment managers can’t beat the index has become something of a truism within investing circles. A leading proponent of that view has been legendary investor Warren Buffett. In his 2018 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, he continues to advocate low-fee indexing as the best approach for most individual investors. Here, Tim Armour, chairman and chief executive officer of Capital Group, home of American Funds, discusses Mr. Buffett’s views and adds his perspective to the indexing discussion.
What are your thoughts on Warren Buffett’s recent comments that seem to endorse index investing?
First off, it’s impossible to be an investor and not have tremendous respect for Warren Buffett and his track record. As an investor myself and someone who leads an investment management organization, I have a special appreciation for just how difficult it is to do what he’s done. And his company building on its success in 2017 is a testament to that fact.
However, to suggest that everyday investors cannot hope to outpace the index is to overlook the fact that American Funds' equity-focused funds have done just that — on a pretty consistent basis — for many decades.
Mr. Buffett’s approach at Berkshire Hathaway has many similarities to how we at Capital Group have built the superior track record1 of the American Funds ― bottom-up investing, rigorous analysis and building durable portfolios. This research-driven, long-term, buy-and-hold approach has meant lower portfolio turnover and a superior long-term track record. 
Mr. Buffett is not the only indexing proponent. Why do you think this view is so prevalent?
It’s important to say that we don’t dispute the data that has led Mr. Buffett and others to form their views. We agree that the average investment manager does not outpace the market over meaningful time horizons. However, a fairly simple fact has gotten lost in the debate: Not all investment managers are average. As we like to say, “Just because the average person can’t dunk a basketball doesn’t mean that no one can dunk a basketball.”
Indeed, notwithstanding his stance on indexing, Mr. Buffett and others acknowledge that there are exceptions. We are one of them. Selecting a manager whose track record has demonstrated the ability to deliver better outcomes can make a very meaningful difference in an investor’s life. The difference between the market average and returns that are even 1 percent better over the long term can mean a much larger nest egg for a retirement that could last decades.
How does an investor find above-average funds?
Extensive research dispels the common myth that it’s impossible for an investment manager to beat the index. Among the tools for identifying these funds are two straightforward screening criteria.
The first is expenses. Selecting low-cost funds can significantly increase your success rate. Second, funds with managers who have “skin in the game” ― those who invest in the funds they manage ― have tended to do better over various time frames.
Using these simple screens identifies a select group of funds that have, on average, consistently outpaced benchmark indexes. This can help increase the probability of identifying some funds and screening out the rest.
Given what’s happening in markets today, does being able to identify funds that meet these screens take on added importance?
The recent return of volatility to the market has shown us the flipside of the indexing coin — namely, that while index funds allow an investor to participate in rising markets, they provide no buffer against down markets; index fund investors are guaranteed to fall as far as the market does. Despite the trillions of dollars that have flowed into them, only about half of investors we surveyed were aware that index funds expose them to 100% of the volatility and losses during market downturns, according to our recent “Wisdom of Experience” survey. And doing better than the crowd in bad times is critical for investors seeking to grow their nest egg over the long term. Actively managed investments like the American Funds offer the potential to lose less than index-tracking investments during market declines.
What’s your view on the value of professional advice?
Capital Group has long believed in the value a financial advisor can bring to investors, helping them pursue their long-term investment goals. We believe advisors help motivate people to save and, perhaps most importantly, they can serve as a steadying hand during volatile times when human nature often drives investors to make decisions that wind up being counterproductive.
In fact, in his most recent letter to shareholders, Mr. Buffet observed that investors' minds may well become rattled by scary headlines and breathless commentary, and an unsettled mind will not make good decisions. We agree and believe an advisor can truly add value in those circumstances. We likewise agree with Mr. Buffett that Americans need to save more and stay invested, and advisors play a pivotal role in helping people do both of those things.
The question of how advisory services are delivered and paid for is a different one. The good news is that people have more choices than ever in terms of how they seek and pay for advice.

But volatility has moved in multi-year cycles throughout the history of the VIX, so the relative tranquility of 2017 was not likely to persist forever. Volatility has picked up in recent weeks as markets have focused on the uncertainty surrounding monetary policy, inflation, and the trajectory of interest rates. While some pickup in volatility from last year’s extremely low levels is to be expected, it is too early to say if we are in a new volatility regime. Investors should be aware that periods of high volatility have historically been accompanied by below-average returns in the S&P 500 Index. However, these cycles can also create new opportunities.

Stocks have been hit with sharp losses in recent days.
Strong economic indicators have spooked equity markets.
The decline prices in tightening financial conditions.
Global growth is in sync, but so is central bank policy.
The equity market lost more than 8% in a few weeks’ time. This decline to the S&P 500 Composite Index, which began in late January, is the first of its kind since 2016. This volatility comes as investors come to terms with a new economic and investment environment of higher interest rates and rising inflation. 
The current volatility in equity markets is likely a sign that financial markets are coming to grips with the idea that the low growth environment may be giving way to a stronger cycle with rising inflation. Stock and bond markets have declined amid concerns about stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data. Selling accelerated on Friday and Monday as robust U.S. job growth, and even better wage growth, led many investors to conclude that significantly higher inflation might be just around the corner, leading to higher interest rates.
Strong wage growth was the big surprise. Friday’s announced 2.9% year-over-year increase in pay is the highest rate of growth since 2009, and it is essentially the missing link in the U.S. economic recovery story. With the unemployment rate at a 17-year low of 4.1%, GDP growth at a healthy 2.6% and recent federal tax cuts expected to boost consumer and business spending, investors are worried that the U.S. economy may be showing early signs of overheating. That could lead to rising inflation this year and a steeper rise in interest rates than the market was previously expecting.
Investors’ unease first showed up in the bond market. Over the past five weeks, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose more than 30 basis points to north of 2.7%, a big move in such a short period of time.
How good economic news created bad stock market news
The global economic cycle started to get in sync in 2017. The flipside of more robust growth is that central banks are also more likely to raise rates. That means even on the back of the Fed’s 125 basis points of rate hikes since late 2015, the market is taking seriously its threat to raise rates three or more times in 2018 and perhaps 2019. In the meantime, the Bank of England has also begun raising rates as the European Central Bank is cutting its bond purchases in half this year. That provides the market a sobering reality that ultra-low interest rates, which have been so supportive of economic growth and asset prices, may be changing and could force investors to re-evaluate expectations.
The economic engine is roaring
Despite the U.S. having been in recovery since 2009, its economic data continues to improve. After strong growth in the latter part of 2017, markets expect a healthy dose of stimulus from tax cuts passed late last year.
The missing piece of the puzzle in recent years has been wage growth. Last week, that began to look on better footing as well. While the 200,000 new January jobs reported on February 2 suggests robust hiring, wage growth accelerated to 2.9% year-over-year – the fastest pace in eight years. While my base case for wages growth has been a gradual acceleration in 2018 and 2019, as labor market slack tightens and the economy approaches full employment, it seems the market has taken this as evidence that the economy is stronger than some expected. 
It also implies that inflation could be rising. It broke out of its mid-2017 range later in the year, with the Consumer Price Index rising up to and slightly above the Fed’s 2% target by year-end. If higher wages figure in, this could help to propel consumer price growth higher later this year. 
The market's decline
An uptick in inflation provides the Fed strong cover to make good on its rate hiking projections, which the market had been somewhat sanguine about. Investors had also been complacent on the impact of central bank tightening – until now. Goldman Sachs’s Financial Conditions Index (a measure that takes into account short-term bond yields, long-term corporate bond yields, the dollar exchange rate and equity prices) began to spike in the week ending February 2, after bottoming out in late January to indicate the easiest financial conditions in more than a decade.
In addition to recent stock market volatility, this re-evaluation is evident in fixed income markets, where this stronger-than-expected economic data during the past five weeks helped yields to climb. The 10-year Treasury yield has risen roughly 30 basis points to above 2.70%, a level not seen since April 2014.  That was following the end of the so-called “taper tantrum” sparked by the Federal Reserve’s 2013 announcement that the central bank was planning to reduce its bond-buying stimulus program.
However, bond yields still remain historically low. In my view, we won’t see another swing of this magnitude in the near term, but rates could approach 3% this year.
Where stocks go from here
What does this re-evaluation mean for U.S. stock valuations? There is less room for cushion with valuations higher than normal; however, looking at earnings, there’s reasons to be constructive. Global consumers are spending, corporate balance sheets are relatively stable and the U.S. tax cuts passed late last year could support upwards of low double-digit earnings growth in 2018. Looking into 2019, the stimulatory factors of 2018 may wane, which could result in more modest earnings growth.
Ultimately, better growth is positive for companies, but if the market hadn’t properly priced in the potential for financial conditions tightening, that could spell trouble. Equity markets may be looking beyond 2018 to determine how to discount cash flows in a rising rate environment. Tightening financial conditions could temper investors’ enthusiasm. The current volatility could be a signal that valuations are now more grounded in reality. Whether additional volatility occurs depends on how much tighter financial conditions actually become. Rising political uncertainty in Washington has also dampened market sentiment in recent days.
It’s important to remember that the current market decline represents a pullback for a U.S. stock market that has gone up 30% since January 2016. So this pullback represents a healthy decline.
Over the medium term, I expect stocks to continue to be supported by earnings that have been stronger for companies not just in the U.S., but also in Europe and Asia.

Europe’s equity returns lagged those in the U.S. for much of the last decade, but Europe took the lead in 2017 on a dollar basis. The strong rally has narrowed a once wide valuation gap between the two markets, but value should remain in European stocks. This is particularly clear when comparing yields between European equities and bonds. While bond yields remain near historic lows, the MSCI Europe Index’s dividend yield has drifted higher over the last 15 years. In the past, European equities may not have been a compelling option for investors seeking additional income in their portfolios, but in today’s low yield world they increasingly make sense. With economic activity picking up and many political headwinds in the past, the European equity rally may have more room to run.

A synchronized global recovery is an ideal environment for emerging markets, similar to the period that lasted from 2003 to 2007.

Emerging markets have shifted from smokestacks to smartphones. Back in 2008, energy and materials companies dominated the MSCI Emerging Markets Index with a 38% weighting, and many of these firms were state-owned enterprises that were more susceptible to infrastructure-driven booms and busts.
Chinese technology-related firms are now the biggest companies by market value in emerging markets as mobile phone usage is accelerating and internet penetration rates are rising. Along with middle class growth, these developments are changing consumption patterns and delivery methods for financial services.

As the current consumer-driven economic expansion heads into its eighth year, investing in the U.S. consumer seems like a logical strategy. Higher consumer spending should theoretically boost a wide range of stocks in the consumer discretionary sector. In reality, the gains in that sector have been concentrated in just a few names — like Amazon, Home Depot, Netflix and McDonalds.  The consumer discretionary sector has climbed 46% since the beginning of 2014. Without those four companies, however, the sector has actually declined more than 10%. These four firms are among the new breed of consumer-facing companies that are taking increasing market share partially due to disruptive trends and technological advances. Amazon’s growing influence in the retail industry through its expanding online consumer marketplace is just one example of a disruption that sets the company apart from others. The outsized returns of these four companies provide an example of how important fundamental investment research is in helping to identify companies that could benefit from higher consumer confidence and spending.

108,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/EUPAC-outlook-international-equities.html,EuroPacific Growth Fund manager sees brighter outlook for international equities,Global Equities,"November 29, 2017","Carl Kawaja is an equity portfolio manager and principal investment officer of American Funds EuroPacific Growth Fund®, the world’s largest actively managed international equity fund. In this interview, Carl explains why he is optimistic about international stocks following a long period of trailing U.S. markets.
What is your outlook for international equity markets?
It’s been a very strong year so far for non-U.S. markets and I expect that to continue. Prior to the start of 2017, international equities went through a difficult period, lagging U.S. equities for nearly a decade. In the EuroPacific Growth Fund, we provide international diversification because we believe it's a prudent part of an overall investment portfolio, but the results also need to be competitive relative to the S&P 500 over some significant period of time. There will always be periods when international stocks lag, but there also should be times when they outpace U.S. markets and I believe we are embarking on one of those periods now.
Why do you think the rally will continue into 2018?
There are quite a few reasons. Non-U.S. companies are starting to put a greater emphasis on profitability and shareholder returns. We’re seeing broad-based strength across a number of international markets, not just one or two. We’re also seeing strength across all sectors. The European economy has stabilized. Japan appears to be headed in the right direction. And many emerging markets are as strong as they’ve been in quite a while. Dollar weakness has also helped. Additionally, Europe and Japan took longer than the U.S. to recover from the global financial crisis so, arguably, they have more room to run. For all of these reasons, I remain positive about the outlook going forward.
Do you feel less optimistic about U.S. stocks?
In the U.S., I am less sanguine, but I’m also not particularly negative either. U.S. equity valuations have gone up a lot over the past couple years, however, we've also seen a tremendous earnings recovery and we've seen remarkable innovation at a variety of companies. So, yes, I am more confident about the outlook for non-U.S. markets, in part, because U.S. markets have been very strong. But amid all the gnashing of teeth and hand wringing about high valuations in the U.S., I think a lot of folks have lost sight of the incredible innovation, discovery and progress that’s been made in the U.S. over the past decade — particularly in the information technology, consumer discretionary and health care sectors. That drives asset values. I think investors would be well served to keep a core allocation to U.S. equities, but think about rebalancing toward international markets.
Some would argue that global equity market gains in recent years have been largely driven by central bank stimulus measures. What’s your view?
The world’s major central banks have provided a favorable tailwind, without a doubt. But would financial markets or certain companies be doing well today absent those stimulus measures? Yes, certainly. I think there’s no question about that. Did quantitative easing and low interest rates help Google a little bit? Maybe. But many other things helped, too. Google is at the forefront of developing self-driving car technology. Google acquired YouTube and now roughly 40% of all music consumed in America is consumed on YouTube. I use Gmail every day. I use Google search every day. This is a company, in my opinion, that would have done well over the past few years with or without central bank interventions in the financial markets.
What about political risk in Europe? Are you concerned about the spread of populism and nationalism, especially as the U.K. prepares to leave the European Union?
I have a slightly non-consensus view with respect to European integration. On balance, I think it has succeeded. We have a common currency that was established despite great teething pains. In recent years, it would have been easy for Italy to waive its debts and go back to the lira, but the Italians decided it was not in their best interest. The same with Portugal and Spain. For some countries, the rewards have accrued asymmetrically. Spain had a period where European integration was the best thing possible. Spaniards were borrowing money at German interest rates, and building new homes, and that created a lot of wealth. And European integration has certainly been wonderful for Germany. It's the biggest economy in Europe, so if you want to argue that Europe has not been successful, you'd have to leave out the biggest place.
Shifting to emerging markets, Chinese internet companies have been among the best-returning stocks in 2017. What’s driving their success?
That’s a regulatory question. China doesn’t allow U.S. internet companies to operate in the country. Although I'm generally not a fan of government intervention, it seems to have aided China in developing their own internet companies. China’s internet companies are not poor shadows of their U.S. counterparts; they are quite innovative and progressive themselves. For example, Alibaba is a world-class e-commerce company. That doesn't mean it would be successful in the U.S., but Alibaba’s service offering is extraordinary and certainly comparable to Amazon’s service in the West. Meanwhile, in Europe, we’ve seen the exact opposite. U.S. internet companies have colonized Europe. The Facebook of France is called Facebook. The Twitter of Germany is called Twitter. The Google of Spain is called Google.
Japan has suffered through decades of economic stagnation, but there are signs of recovery in the works. How do you think about Japan from an investment perspective?
Japan has been a wonderful place to invest over the years, largely because we have ignored the economic conditions and focused on individual companies with great products. A good example is Nintendo, which has a popular video game console called the Switch that’s both portable and stationary. It's a traditional game console and you can also take it with you while you're walking around. A product like that has nothing to do with the Japanese economy, or central bank policies, or the political leadership of the country. Nintendo has a game console and video games that people love. This is why we focus on fundamental, bottom-up research.
Tell us about the investment approach of the EuroPacific Growth Fund. How is it positioned and how are you thinking about the future?
In terms of how EUPAC is positioned, the fund is differentiated from its benchmark (the MSCI All Country World Index ex USA) because it reflects the highest-conviction ideas of our team of portfolio managers and analysts. For instance, we've had a degree of concentration in Chinese internet companies. We've had a lot of exposure to the technology sector, and we’ve had some success in emerging markets, which have generally fared well this year. Also, I would add that EUPAC is the largest actively managed international-focused mutual fund, but our size has not inhibited our results. In relative terms, as well as absolute terms, we have done well against our benchmark even as the size of the fund has grown.
I've been involved with this fund for more than 20 years and I will say one of our advantages is — although it is called growth fund — it’s actually a very flexible fund. We focus on growth of capital, not necessarily growth companies. So that means we can buy companies with low valuations if we think they are going to be re-rated and the share price is going to rise. Our portfolio managers have the flexibility to take different approaches, depending on each specific opportunity. Our primary goal is to do well for our shareholders on a long-term basis and to avoid terrible down periods to the greatest extent that we can. For me, that has led to an approach that says: be flexible.

AMBAL portfolio manager says yes,U.S. Equities,"October 25, 2017","Greg Johnson is an equity portfolio manager and principal investment officer of American Balanced Fund. He discusses his outlook for U.S. stocks and his reasons for wanting to lean against the stock market rally.
What is your outlook on U.S. equity markets?
I am getting cautious on U.S. equities. We could be in the late stages of this economic and market cycle. We have gone an entire year without a 5% correction, which is unusual. The U.S. equity markets increasingly appear to be priced for perfection. Equity valuations, at least by historical standards, are high.
You can see our more cautious stance in our positioning. At the end of 2013, American Balanced Fund was at 74% in equities, it is now at 62% and I expect the equity allocation to come down further. I realize that we may lag if this bull market continues, but my focus is much more on protecting on the downside. As we all know, no one can precisely time the markets, but as this stock market continues to go up, my inclination will be to lean against it.
What in this late cycle worries you?
Earnings are improving, but earnings quality is arguably not the best. If valuations were not stretched, it would be less of an issue, but the aggregate price-earnings multiple of the market, at more than 21, is high. As and when interest rates go up, that multiple becomes less sustainable.
Capital allocation decisions by corporations, as evidenced by their continued purchase of stocks, are not getting better. Total corporate debt is huge at something like $11 trillion. Credit spreads are tight. Sure, it is debt that has been raised at very low rates. But we are seeing covenants in new deals to be less friendly to buyers and more in favor of lenders. Additionally, about $8 trillion of bonds offered globally has negative interest rates.
As central banks start to unwind the quantitative easing program they put in place during the financial crisis, financial conditions can tighten. We may see inflation move higher as wages rise. Aggregate consumer demand has shown a sharp improvement in September. This could force the Federal Reserve to become more aggressive than it has been. Against this backdrop, if interest rates rise, the valuations become even less sustainable.
What worries me in terms of the structure of the markets is the sheer volume of money that is flowing into passive products such as ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), and the number of ETFs that are tied to narrow areas of the market. Correlations across asset classes have increased substantially. In a market selloff, it is not entirely clear how these products will behave and what the impact will be on the broader market.
Technology has become a large part of the markets and many of our funds. It could lead a market decline just as it has led the rally. What are your thoughts?
Technology today is different from the era of the dot-com bubble. The dominant companies today have sustainable profits, strong cash flows and huge market share. Given the large capital expenditures they make every year in billions of dollars, they have high barriers to entry. I would argue that earnings for technology companies today are more stable than many other sectors of the market. If you look at some companies like Netflix, Amazon and Microsoft, they are almost subscription-like businesses.
One could argue that these companies are over-owned, as they are held by a broad cross section of investors including momentum strategies, growth funds and value funds. So yes, the stocks could be vulnerable in a market correction, but the long-term fundamentals remain quite strong. They have the strongest balance sheets, the greatest visibility of earnings and sustainable business models of any sectors in the market.
What areas of the market are you gravitating to as you get more cautious on U.S. stocks?
The traditional defensive areas of the market — utilities and consumer staples — are not cheap at a price-earnings ratio of more than 20. I am more comfortable with holdings in financials. I think they will probably hold up better in choppier times in this cycle. The dividends associated with financials are much more sustainable, they have substantially increased their capital base, they have been conservative in their lending and the interest rate cycle is favorable to them. Energy is another area that is not as expensive, and given where valuations are today, many of these stocks may hold up better in a declining market.
Keep in mind that reversion-to-the-mean investing in this market cycle has not worked too well. Technology has been a huge disrupter in many industries and we have invested in many of these disrupters to the benefit of American Balanced Fund. That said, these stocks have had a huge run-up and have become a significant part of the momentum trades dominating markets today.
Growth stocks (as represented by the Russell 1000 Growth) have risen 23% year-to-date (through September 30, 2017) and value stocks (Russell 1000 Value) have risen 9%. That’s a huge gap. I believe that eventually, reversion-to-the-mean investing does work and that value investing is a sound principle. So I personally am trying to reposition the portion of the fund’s portfolio I manage to areas of the market that have lagged — in companies that are misunderstood or unloved by the market — like some of the commercial property REITS, or some of the financials.
How are you thinking about the fixed income allocation in a balanced fund against this backdrop?
In American Balanced Fund, the primary role of the bond portfolio is to provide protection in a broad market selloff. So the bond portfolio is designed not to have a high correlation to the stock portfolio — that it generates some income but not at the cost of diversification. It is a high-quality, investment-grade bond portfolio. We have portfolio managers who are very hands-on in managing that portfolio, squeezing out singles and doubles from duration and credit positioning with the aim of delivering an excess return above market benchmarks. But they do this while staying focused on the overall objective of fixed income, which is to provide the diversification from equities. This allows us to have a more aggressively positioned stock portfolio than we would otherwise.

113,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/why-tech-giants-misunderstood.html,Why “tech giants” are misunderstood,Technology & Innovation,"October 12, 2017","Five companies — Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook — account for more than $4 trillion of the S&P 500’s roughly $22 trillion market capitalization. Now the most highly valued companies in the world, their stratospheric rise and heavy weighting in the S&P have investors and market commentators asking a lot of questions.
As a Capital Group equity portfolio manager based in San Francisco, Mark Casey grapples with these questions daily. Here’s how he thinks about these companies and their potential for growth.
How do you think about the rise of these giant companies in the tech sector?
First, I think referring to them as being part of the “tech sector” obscures more than it clarifies.
Of these companies, only Microsoft, via its Office and Server & Tools segments, and Amazon, via Amazon Web Services, generate significant portions of their revenue from corporate technology budgets. The rest of the revenue generated by these companies comes from budgets that have nothing to do with corporate technology spending.
Apple generates revenue primarily by selling replacement iPhones to consumers, and anyone who has misplaced his phone for a day will tell you that a phone now seems more like a consumer staple than a consumer discretionary or technology purchase.
Alphabet’s Google is a sort of digital yellow pages that generates revenue from advertisers paying to reach consumers when they’re researching things to buy. Facebook is like a TV channel that shows content from your friends and family and that generates revenue from advertisers who are guessing what might influence you when you’re seeking to be entertained or informed. Finally, most of Amazon’s revenue comes from its retail business.
All in all, these five companies have wildly divergent ways of generating revenue.
How should we be classifying these companies?
I’m fine with classifying Microsoft as a company that’s part of the tech sector. I have no idea how to classify Amazon, which is No. 1 in e-commerce, No. 1 in cloud-computing service infrastructure and No. 2 in streaming video, behind Netflix and ahead of Hulu. Amazon is also a company making inroads into a diverse range of industries, including parcel delivery, online payments and offline grocery.
It’s similarly difficult to pigeonhole a company that, like Alphabet, is No. 1 in search, No. 1 in third-party advertising technology, No. 1 in user-generated video content (YouTube) and operates the world’s largest mobile operating system for smartphones (Android). The company is also the early leader in self-driving cars (Waymo), and investing in areas as diverse as life extension (Calico) and artificial intelligence (DeepMind).
One thing these five companies have in common is that they’ve proven themselves to be uncommonly good at developing and exploiting technologies to benefit their customers and themselves.
Regardless of what you call these companies, are they fully valued here?
Possibly yes, possibly no, and possibly some of each. Only time will tell. That said, it’s easy to see how some of these stocks could turn out to be undervalued today.
Apple, for example, has a market cap of $796B, taxed net cash of around $110B, and thus an enterprise value of around $686B. Investors are expecting the company to earn $50B in the next 12 months, putting today’s enterprise value at less than 15 times that figure. Compared with how stocks in the U.S. have been valued during the past century, Apple’s current multiple strikes me as about average for what is plainly a well above average company.
Similarly, if we give Alphabet credit for its huge net cash position, the multiple of profit generated by the core Google business does not strike me as high relative to what’s been merited historically by companies with Google’s track record and growth prospects.
How vulnerable are these companies to competition and new technological innovation?
Any or all five of these companies could fall victim to technology disruptions or competitive attack at any time. On the other hand, it’s not as though these businesses have never been battle tested. They have so far withstood quite a lot of competitive pressure — much of it from each other.
Google tried to kill the iPhone with Android, and though Android succeeded in getting 80% of the market by volume, the installed base of iPhone users continues to grow. Google tried to kill Microsoft Office with Google Apps, yet Microsoft Office’s installed base continues to grow. Both Microsoft and Google have tried to kill Amazon Web Services, but it remains No. 1 by a wide margin.
Facebook has tried to compete against Google in search, and Google has tried to compete against Facebook in social and messaging, but each company continues to hold its own.
Just as we should not ignore the risk that each of these companies will be disrupted by a new technology, we also shouldn’t ignore the possibility that one of these companies will disrupt some other part of the global economy.
Alphabet’s Waymo, for example, might possibly create a huge new business in self-driving car operating systems and transform the automotive business as we know it. Many of these five companies excel at the core machine learning technologies that could lead to similar outcomes in other industries.

114,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/equity-portfolio-more-global-than-you-think.html,Your equity portfolio may be more global than you think,Global Equities,"October 11, 2017","The notion of global investing is not what it used to be just 10 years ago.
Rapid advancements in technology, free trade agreements and the rise of multinationals in emerging markets have transformed the structure of the economic world today, allowing companies to compete for customers, labor and capital on a global basis. These profound shifts have changed the way to think about global investing, not only in terms of opportunities but also portfolio allocation decisions.
Rather than dividing portfolios in regional slices, I believe global flexibility is crucial to designing a “future-proof” portfolio amid the changing dynamics of business and trade.
Welcome to the new geography.
Globalization and an increase in open trade is having a significant impact on the universe of investment opportunities, meaning that companies headquartered in Europe, Japan and the U.S. don’t necessarily generate most of their revenue in their home country like they once used to.
Furthermore, the rise of economies in China, India and other emerging markets is having a profound effect on the global economy and major implications for companies in the developed world.
For instance, a review of S&P 500 company revenues shows that about 37% is derived from outside the U.S. Meanwhile, the 10 largest companies in the MSCI Europe Index get approximately 69% of revenues from outside Europe, in part due to slower growth in their region and better opportunities abroad.
So when considering how much of your portfolio is exposed to the global economy, I’ve found that digging into where a company generates its revenue is a much more practical and transparent yardstick, rather than relying on an index structured around domicile or country.
As a bottom-up investor, I use this approach to broaden the opportunity set of investment choices. It gives me the flexibility to look across a global industry and select the companies that I believe are best positioned for growth, regardless of their location.
From goods to gigabytes
Investors often used to think of multinational companies as powerhouses in commodities or heavy industries, but a host of new global companies is rapidly emerging. If the 20th century was defined by a phenomenal rise in the transfer of goods and industrial commodities, the 21st century is being characterized by the rapid digitization of services and the increasing automation of manufacturing.
The knowledge economy, or digital trade, is gaining momentum, and this is giving rise to a new breed of global giants that are “idea” companies — think Amazon or Alphabet (Google’s parent). These companies are creative, nimble and networked, leveraging technology to their advantage.
With the internet, there are no real borders, which creates paradigm shifts in the way companies are organized and in how products are consumed. Product adoption can be swift and distribution costs limited — the smartphone or tablet is the delivery mechanism.
It’s no wonder that the composition of the world’s most valuable companies by market value has changed dramatically since 2007, with tech-related firms dominating the index rather than old-line behemoths in the oil, finance and industrials sectors.
Globalization is here to stay.
As borders blur, the flexibility to invest in companies anywhere in the world has become important as investors seek to benefit from globalization. The growth of the FTSE Multinationals Index is a reflection of the rise in global commerce since the 1990s. Index members, which must derive more than 30% of their revenue from outside their domestic region, has expanded to 715 from 427 in 1994.
Despite recent protectionist rhetoric, it’s hard to see globalization reversing: It’s embedded in the way many companies do business, supply chains are set up and products are manufactured. Apple is an obvious example: Its supply chain spans 30 countries, and it is a master of using geography to its advantage, sourcing suppliers that can churn out cost-effective parts that adhere to its quality requirements.
Moreover, many established multinationals like Unilever, Nestlé and Coca-Cola have been moving closer to end-markets over the years. They have decentralized their operations to be much more local to gain a deeper understanding of local markets and compete with a rising number of domestic companies.
Moving forward, we are likely to see global trade patterns evolve with the increasing digitization of commerce and the likelihood of new trade, tariff and tax structures in many parts of the world.
Of course, not all global companies will thrive in this environment. Fundamental research will be key to identifying potential winners.
Having invested in global companies for nearly three decades, I have found that successful multinational companies typically have innovative management teams, diverse sources of revenue and resilient balance sheets. These are the attributes I will be looking for as globalization enters a new era.

It may seem like U.S. equities recovered from the financial crisis years ago, but the market as a whole has not. The global financial crisis naturally hit financial stocks the hardest, and the sector declined nearly 80% following its peak in May 2007. And while the S&P 500 Index reached new highs way back in 2012, financials have lagged. The sector only recently surpassed its previous peak – more than 10 years later. The S&P 500 has doubled in that time, raising valuation concerns about U.S. stocks generally. However, given financials’ slower recovery, they may still have more room to run. Further rate hikes from the Fed could provide another boost to the industry.

116,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/3-reasons-international-investing.html,3 reasons for international investing today,Global Equities,"September 27, 2017","International stocks have struggled for much of the past decade, challenged by a multitude of headwinds, ranging from Eurozone politics to the strength of the U.S dollar to skittishness over China’s economy.
With U.S. stocks dominating global results in recent years, many investors question how much of their portfolio should be devoted to international stocks after years of subpar returns.
Markets are cyclical, and history shows that the pendulum eventually swings back the other way. This reversal may well be underway as we are beginning to see some encouraging signs for non-U.S. equities.
1. Tide appears to be turning in Europe.  
In my view, the outlook for picking stocks in Europe is now more constructive. After lurching from crisis to crisis over the past several years, Europe appears to be stabilizing on the political and economic fronts, and this advancement should help alleviate some of the uncertainty that has weighed on equities there.
After a wave of populism spooked the markets, political risks seem to be ebbing. Namely, Emmanuel Macron’s presidential victory in France on a business friendly and pro-European Union platform was a key turning point. Along with Macron’s triumph, other centrist politicians across Europe appear to be beating back a populist backlash against the EU.
While Europe’s economic recovery has gone through fits and starts for nearly a decade, there are reassuring signs that growth may finally be turning a corner. GDP growth in the 19-member euro zone is accelerating, unemployment is at its lowest level in eight years and consumer confidence is improving.
All of this sets the stage for a more stable backdrop in which structural reforms can be addressed to strengthen the EU, as well as a more conducive environment to find good companies in which to invest.
2. Dollar headwind abates amid global economic recovery.
The U.S. dollar is finally weakening against several major currencies — including the euro, British pound and Japanese yen — after a remarkable run that began in early 2011. For dollar-based investors, this development could have a significant impact on returns for global and international portfolios as our research has found that historically a significant portion of total return has accrued from the currency portion.
Past history shows that currency cycles have generally lasted for five to eight years, and our currency analyst believes we are now in a period of gradual dollar weakening after an extended period of strength.
Concurrent with the dollar depreciating, the world’s major economies all appear to be moving in the same general direction for the first time since the 2008 credit crisis. Manufacturing activity is expanding in many countries, China’s economy has avoided a much-feared hard landing and raw material prices have stabilized. Even Japan’s economy, long mired in a slump, is finally undergoing a revival with gross domestic product expanding for six straight quarters. Meanwhile, corporate profits for companies based in emerging markets are increasing after several uneven years, driven by demand for commodities, strong earnings from technology companies and rising wealth that is boosting overall consumption.
At the same time, a weaker dollar should help earnings for U.S. multinationals that generate most of their revenue overseas.
3. Mind the valuation gaps.
Given the improving landscape for international equities and eight-year bull market for U.S. stocks, it may be time to consider markets outside the U.S. A look at the world’s market capitalization levels shows that the U.S. is hovering near the top of its historical range while overseas markets are near all-time lows. Large valuation gaps between U.S. and European firms have been narrowing in recent months, but there are still select investment opportunities.
Lately, I’ve been finding attractive opportunities to invest in global companies that act as middlemen for their respective industries — some call these the “picks and shovels” companies, meaning they supply the materials rather than digging for gold. These are corporations that I believe trade at reasonable valuations based on my projections for their earnings growth.
One example of a company in this category would be Taiwan Semiconductor, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of semiconductors used in computers, consumer electronics, automobiles and industrial equipment. Another is Thermo Fisher Scientific, a U.S. company providing instruments, laboratory equipment and consumables to pharmaceutical and biotech companies, governments and academic institutions.
When considering these companies and others with similar characteristics, I don’t necessarily have to make short-term calls on the direction of the global economy, interest rates or the likelihood of major legislative reforms. Instead, I can focus on fundamentals, looking at companies across the world while trying to take advantage of tailwinds I see in this ongoing global economic recovery.

Equity markets are on an impressive run this year with the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI) returning 15% and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index returning approximately 12% through July 31. However, as the calendar moves through August and into September, equity markets may lose some momentum. The MSCI ACWI and S&P 500 have posted negative returns in August and September on average since 1989, and tend to be two of the weakest months of the year for equities. For investors with a longer time horizon, staying invested in equity markets during a seasonal period of short-term weakness may be rewarded, as the last three months of the calendar year have historically had better returns.

When excluding FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google parent Alphabet) plus the two largest technology companies (Apple and Microsoft), the U.S. does not look as overvalued as it may first appear. In fact, its price-to-earnings ratio becomes comparable to international markets, which have been touted for having more bargain opportunities during the recent expansion. Tech still maintains strong growth potential, but investors should remember that aggregate numbers don’t tell the entire story, and fundamental research can be used to uncover stocks still under the radar.

121,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/4-charts-show-tech-boom-not-bubble.html,4 charts that show this tech boom is no dot-com bubble,Technology & Innovation,"August 3, 2017","Shares of many technology giants are at record highs, rekindling comparisons to the dot-com bubble. But this boom looks different. The dominant companies have solid profits, enormous cash flows, large market share and high barriers to entry. At current price levels, there is no denying that the valuations are high, but nowhere near the unsustainable levels of the dot-com period.
Here’s what some of Capital Group’s portfolio managers and analysts have to say:
1. Unlike the dot-com bubble, profits are now in sync with prices.
Irfan Furniturewala, investment analyst covering U.S. hardware and semiconductor companies:
This is a new era. During the late 1990s tech boom that peaked in early 2000, share prices of web companies outran their earnings potential, stretching valuations to unsustainable levels. This is not the case currently. Profits for technology companies are more in sync with their share prices.
A big difference from the dot-com period is that, as a group, these stocks don’t all trade at nosebleed valuations. Apple, with the upcoming release of the iPhone 8, is only at 14 times consensus earnings for the next 12 months. In the case of Microsoft and Google, these stocks trade for less than 25 times forward earnings. While those valuations are richer than the broader market, it is easier to make a case that these companies can grow into those multiples.
The five large technology companies (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft) have learned from the mistakes that the big companies made in the dot-com era. So today, they are much more obsessed with making sure their technologies — and business models — stay relevant. These companies don’t seem to be running out of steam. If anything, they are doubling down on new technologies such as artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles, which makes the barriers to entry even more prohibitive for startups and more established companies. Companies like Yelp and TripAdvisor are being sidelined by the power of the Google search engine, as an example. Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon are spending more than $10 billion a year on research and development, which substantially raises barriers to entry for newcomers. I truly believe we are undergoing a massive transformation in technology over the next 20 years, and these companies are at the frontier of change.
2. Tech balance sheets are cash-heavy.
Jody Jonsson, portfolio manager for New Perspective Fund®:
Unlike the previous bubble, tech companies are flush with cash.
Stronger balance sheets are a testament to the underlying strength of their business models. Cash balances at Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet are the largest among nonfinancial companies in the U.S. Apple and Microsoft even pay quarterly dividends — a big shift from a decade ago, when the thought of a technology company paying a dividend was seen as a sign that growth was slowing.
The biggest tech companies have great topline growth, substantial cash flows and strong earnings. They also have dominant market positions and pricing power. As an investor, it’s hard to dislike companies with these near-monopolistic attributes. On the other hand, they could also be vulnerable as regulators scrutinize them more closely and policymakers become more sensitive to the social impact of the potential disruptions they could cause.
Business models in technology have changed, as have consumption patterns, which make the industry look less cyclical than in prior peaks. The volatility in technology share prices is also lower than it has been historically. Investors are looking to the sector for reliable growth, which is now hard to find in traditional consumer sectors because of the “Amazon effect.” All of these factors have caused investors to gravitate toward tech. That said, given where valuations and sentiment are right now, we could see a pullback that would affect not only this sector, but also other growth stocks that have a high correlation to technology. We are very positive on technology fundamentals, but these positives are also well-known to the market.
3. Valuations are nowhere near 1999.
Larry Solomon, portfolio manager for The Growth Fund of America®:
The 1999-2000 period was much more speculative than today.
While the leading technology stocks are not cheap today, I don’t think they are nearly as overvalued as the most popular stocks were in 1999. It’s easier to see a scenario in which the current leaders (Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook) can grow into their earnings. They are well-positioned for increased use of mobile, e-commerce, cloud computing and mobile payments. These are all durable trends; it’s just a matter of what you pay for them.
Historically, companies traded on their overall revenue or earnings. But today, shares of some companies are trading based on small parts of their business, or they are generating modest profits with the hope that they will eventually grow into healthy earnings. The complacency about earnings and valuations is one reason why I am cautious.
4. “Winner takes most” rules the internet.
Will Craig, investment analyst covering global internet companies:
The dynamics of the internet have created a “winner takes most” environment. The largest companies — such as Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet — are capturing a majority of incremental market growth. In recent years, they’ve actually begun to grow faster as they’ve become bigger. These businesses are becoming incredibly ubiquitous as their services become rooted in people’s everyday lives, similar to daily household items we use. Their platforms are entrenched, revenue is growing, and cash flows are robust.
This is making life difficult for smaller- and medium-sized internet firms, who increasingly can’t compete with the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon. The smaller internet businesses don’t have significant customer loyalty and brand recognition, and this limits the amount of direct traffic to their websites. They also struggle to hire the same quality of engineering talent and have much less cash on their balance sheets to defend their turf. This hurts their long-term prospects. One could argue that the small-to-mid cap internet space is now in secular decline.

122,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/portfolio-construction-embrace-flexibility.html,Constraints can be costly for investors — embrace flexibility,Portfolio Construction,"July 21, 2017","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Flexible mandates can allow investment professionals to access their best ideas, helping skillful portfolio managers deliver better results.
Several institutions, including Harvard University’s endowment, have been transitioning to broader investment mandates, based on the concern that style-based portfolios over-emphasize asset-class benchmarks at the expense of investor outcomes.
A simulation model of large-cap stocks from 2002–2016 finds that flexibility to adjust the mix of value and growth companies would have increased average returns by up to 0.9% annually, depending on manager skill.
A flexible investment universe may introduce short-term, benchmark-relative risk and drift, but can provide tools that objective-based funds need to achieve long-term goals.
A case study of the American Funds family illustrates how the discipline of using flexibility to pursue objectives has resulted in measured changes in asset allocation and superior long-term results.
Style boxes have been used for many years to construct and monitor portfolios, but according to Casey Quirk (2013), several institutions are now beginning to move away from the model as too restrictive and, in some cases, not in the best interests of their organization or investors.
While style boxes can help bring structure to a portfolio, and style-based funds can easily be used to fulfill a desired asset allocation, such as large-cap growth or small-cap value, there is growing concern about adherence to such a relatively rigid process.
Officials at Harvard, for example, recently expressed concern about style boxes creating restrictive investment silos that could result in both gaps and duplication in a portfolio. In announcing a change in direction earlier this year, N.P. Narvekar, the CEO of Harvard Management Company, Inc., cited the “unintended consequences” of focusing on boxes. “This model has also created an overemphasis on individual asset-class benchmarks that I believe does not lead to the best investment thinking for a major endowment,” Narvekar said.
Harvard is part of a growing movement toward achieving greater investment flexibility by loosening constraints on the investment universe — and transitioning to broader investment mandates. In this article, we review theoretical and empirical evidence on the role of such investment flexibility.
Skill + investment opportunity = alpha
Although the issue is likely to be the topic of ongoing academic debate, significant research indicates managers constrained by style boxes underperform those with a broader mandate that allows them to invest in a more flexible manner.
For example, Howard and Callahan (2006) test four hypothetical trading strategies from 1995–2003 and find that limiting these strategies to fit in each of nine size/style boxes would have reduced annual alpha by an average of 339 basis points. Clarke et al. (2000) construct a more general Monte Carlo simulation to test a variety of constraints and also find that limits on size/style can hinder active results. In addition, Wermers (2002) finds that flexible funds have better results.
As an example of the potential benefits of flexibility, the chart below shows the universe of all U.S. large-cap value and growth stocks. Companies from both categories were combined and ranked by total return, and the top 50% of stocks in that list were apportioned to growth and value based on their Morningstar classifications. The data for the 15-year period ended December 31, 2016, illustrate two key insights:
First, while there are good companies in both value and growth styles every year, their proportion can vary significantly. Value companies made up 54% of the best performers in 2002, but only 19% in 2013.
Second, the stock selection opportunity was not just driven by macro regimes favoring value or growth. Value on average outpaced growth by 18% in 2002, yet almost half the best-performing stocks were growth. Similarly, in 2009, growth outpaced value by 33 percentage points, yet value stocks made up almost one-third of the best-performing companies.
Therefore, an investor who simply invested in the “winning” style every year — and ignored all the stocks in the “losing” style — would have missed opportunities.
It’s still about security selection  
This example highlights how a bottom-up perspective provides unique insights, and that a flexible approach allows managers to tap into a broader opportunity set to navigate different market environments. For example, in the years depicted in the chart, an equal-weighted portfolio of the best companies every year would have outperformed one constrained to be balanced across value and growth stocks (i.e., in the same proportion as the overall market) by an average of 0.9% per year.  This illustration focuses on the flexibility to adjust the mix of value and growth styles; the same principles apply to size, domicile and asset class flexibility.
Although flexibility expands the opportunity set, a broader investment universe alone is insufficient to generate superior results; the benefits of flexibility only accrue to the subset of fund managers who have stock-selection skill. For example, flexibility would not help a portfolio manager who is equally likely to pick an outperforming or underperforming stock. While flexibility is no silver bullet, it can serve to amplify the value of high-quality research.
Focus on objectives, not style boxes
These findings suggest that advisors should seek out portfolio managers with strong research capabilities and allow them to express investment conviction. The gains from flexibility may seem incremental, but can yield materially improved outcomes when compounded over typical investment horizons.
More importantly, these results prompt a critical evaluation of the broader role of investment constraints. Flexibility on size, style and domicile may introduce short-term, benchmark-relative risk and drift, but can provide tools that objective-based funds need to achieve long-term objectives. This approach has become more relevant as many advisors have embraced goals-based wealth management, in which success is defined increasingly as meeting long-term investor goals rather than simply outpacing market indexes.
Skillful investors could potentially benefit by combining looser constraints on the investment universe with a disciplined focus on investment objectives.
An investment strategy seeking long-term appreciation can often benefit from investing in companies with low valuation, as these might represent turn-around opportunities. Similarly, an investment strategy seeking current income may benefit from diversification across dividend-paying companies and high-yielding fixed income. In these scenarios flexibility can provide avenues for improved results, as well as greater diversification.
Funds in the American Funds family with global equity and multi-asset mandates form an interesting case example. These use a broad investment universe to pursue a range of objectives including appreciation, growth and income, income, preservation and even a balance of multiple objectives.
The disciplined focus on investment objectives has resulted in measured changes to asset allocation, as illustrated in the chart below.
Although past results are not predictive of future returns, these flexible funds with at least a 20-year history have demonstrated superior long-term returns, often with lower volatility than index benchmarks. The data suggest that the benefits of including such funds outweigh the modest adjustments that advisors might have to make to their portfolio construction practice.

123,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/weakening-dollar-impact-international-equities.html,Time for investors to rethink dollar’s impact on international equities,Currencies,"June 21, 2017","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
The translation effect of currencies can have a significant impact on returns for global and international portfolios for dollar-based investors.
Currency cycles generally last for five to eight years. After an extended era of dollar strength, our currency analyst believes we are entering a period of dollar weakness.
In periods of dollar weakness, it could be detrimental for investors to have their international and global equity exposure through currency-hedged vehicles.
Investors risk leaving a meaningful portion of total return on the table by investing in such currency-hedged strategies.
It’s been a long, tough slog for dollar-based investors in international equities the past several years.  A remarkable run for the dollar raised doubts about making international stocks part of a well-diversified portfolio. Those concerns — planted by years of sluggish growth and political uncertainty in Europe, deflationary pressures in Japan and weak emerging-markets economies — appear to be coming to an end.
As we have seen, the dollar has weakened against several currencies since the start of the year. It has depreciated 6% against the euro and Japanese yen, respectively, and 2% against the Chinese renminbi, as of June 13. It has also weakened against several emerging-markets currencies. One of the strongest gains against the dollar has come from the Mexican peso, which is up 14% for the year.
This correction suggests strength in the dollar may have run its course. Past history shows that currency cycles have generally lasted for five to eight years. Our currency analyst believes we are now in a period of gradual dollar weakness after an extended era of dollar strength that lasted from early 2011 to late 2016.
“The dollar really rallied hard in 2014, but now I am getting greater conviction that the dollar has peaked and will weaken over the next two to three years,” says Capital Group currency analyst Jens Søndergaard. “We’ve unwound the ‘Trump-bump’ in the dollar and are back at pre-election levels. As long as the global economy picks up and the Fed is cautious about interest rate hikes, this should be conducive for international equities with greater non U.S. revenue exposure.”
Hedging currency risk can cap upside potential
In periods of secular dollar weakness, “it is a mistake for investors to have their international and global equity exposure through currency-hedged vehicles. Investors risk leaving on the table a meaningful portion of total return by investing in these hedged strategies,” says Capital Group investment specialist Marc Nabi. “Historically, a significant portion of total return from international and global equity has accrued from the currency portion,” especially in periods of dollar weakness.""
The buck stops here
Why would the dollar weaken or stay at these levels? There are several factors.
Skepticism is increasing that the new U.S. administration can make good on the agenda it initially outlined, namely loosening financial regulations, pushing through business-friendly tax cuts and rolling out of a major infrastructure program. Moreover, senior U.S. officials are expressing a desire to devalue the dollar — a bluntness not seen in past administrations.
On another front, there is growing belief that the global economy is in the midst of a broad-based recovery, moving in lockstep for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis.
Europe finally appears to be turning the corner.
The euro zone registered gross domestic product growth of 2.3% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, up from 2.1% in the fourth quarter. Euro-area manufacturing and services continue to gain momentum as well, which could further support the euro. Meanwhile, Japan’s economy expanded for the fifth consecutive quarter growing at an annualized pace of 2.2% for the January to March period.
In addition, European political risks are receding after a wave of populist-minded politicians failed to win majorities at the voting polls. The latest example was France, where centrist Emmanuel Macron won the presidential election in decisive fashion, calming fears that France might abandon the European Union and spur a breakup of the 28-nation bloc.
“The global economy is doing well and investor sentiment is improving, which is quite a departure from last year when everyone was worried about China, Brexit and negative interest rates,” says Capital Group portfolio manager Lisa Thompson. “It’s not just the U.S. anymore, it’s Japan, Europe and a number of emerging markets where we are seeing better economic growth, rising consumer spending and signs of higher inflation.”
International equities staging comeback
Already, a weakening dollar and a global recovery are boosting international portfolios. Take Europe for example.
In dollar terms, U.S.-based investors buying shares of European companies are reaping solid returns after no gains in the previous two calendar years. Year to date through June 16, the MSCI European Index is up 16%, outpacing the 10% gain for the S&P 500.
Emerging markets tell a similar story. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is on track for its best annual gain since 2012, with a 17% increase so far this year.
There could be more upside: “The long-term devaluation of currencies such as the yen, the euro and pound against the dollar has made many European and Japanese firms more competitive relative to their U.S. counterparts. European and Japanese companies are starting to see higher dollar sales,"" Nabi says. ""This takes time to work through companies’ income statements, and operating leverage will vary, but as the dollar has stopped rising, this headwind is slowly turning into a tailwind and we should see this come through in earnings.""
Furthermore, valuations are becoming hard to ignore. European equity valuations are appealing, particularly in relation to U.S. stocks, which have outpaced their European counterparts for more than eight years.
For instance, the MSCI Europe Index, whose constituents are listed in 15 developed countries, trades at 15.3 times estimated earnings for the next 12 months, compared with 17.9 times for the MSCI USA Index, as of May 31, 2017. This disparity has made for pronounced valuation gaps between European companies and their U.S. counterparts. This is especially true in areas such as banking, oil and household staples.
Emerging markets trade at an even steeper discount and appear to have more room to run: Earnings are rebounding, cash flows are improving and the dollar is weakening. This often has been a recipe that drives share prices in the developing world.
“If the dollar really has turned and we are in the early innings of the next eight- to 10-year dollar bear market, this could drive big, relative returns for non-U.S. equities since they are so much cheaper at current valuations,” says Paul Benjamin, an equity investment analyst at Capital Group.

124,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/portfolio-construction-rethink-risk.html,Rethink risk: Attributes that matter most for goals-based investors,Portfolio Construction,"June 5, 2017","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Advisors should seek to understand client goals in addition to their risk tolerance.
Risk should be viewed not just through the lens of volatility, but also in context of the likelihood of undershooting goals.
Because risks vary between the accumulation and retirement phases, so should portfolio construction.
Investors can mitigate risk not only by reducing the amount of equity, but also by changing the types of equity.
Fund attributes of downside capture and long-horizon risk are important, and can help improve investor outcomes.
In the world of financial advice, we are seeing a welcome trend toward goals-based wealth management. This trend puts a greater focus on the goals that investors want to achieve with their savings — such as retirement security, paying for college or purchasing a home — and uses these goals to drive investment strategy and monitor progress. The use of the term “objective-based investing” refers to the investment strategies that seek to achieve investors’ goals.
Objective-based investing may seem like an obvious concept, but it represents a departure from the typical risk-tolerance framework, which profiles clients primarily based on whether they have a conservative, moderate or aggressive orientation to investment risk. It turns out that a simple question — what’s most risky — might have a surprisingly nuanced answer depending on the investment and savings goals of an investor.
Risk is not just volatility.
To see objective-based investment management in action, consider a highly simplified example using long-term historical results for three different stock indexes: a large-cap index often used to represent “the market,” a small-cap index, and a dividend-payers index, all measured over the period from 1976 to 2016. The indexes used were selected for their longevity and for purposes of illustrating differing characteristics among types of equities.
Risk is traditionally measured as annualized volatility, or the annualized standard deviation of monthly returns. In this example, Ibbotson Small Cap stocks had the highest annualized volatility and so might be considered most risky.
An objective-based approach might yield a very different perspective. Consider a worker seeking to invest $100,000 toward retirement in 20 years. Her greatest fear is that of insufficient capital appreciation, and therefore she seeks the maximum growth in her investment. In the center chart in the exhibit above, we calculated the average accumulated savings in the worst 5% of all rolling 20-year periods (from 1976 to 2016). This lens suggests that the small cap investment was the least risky, as it returned approximately $581,000 over the least favorable 20-year periods. The dividend-payers index, in contrast, generated only $382,000, on average.
Finally, consider an older retiree seeking the greatest degree of sustainable spending over a 20-year period — what we call the downside withdrawal rate. Any higher withdrawal rate would result in a negative average account balance in the worst 5% of scenarios across rolling 20-year periods. These downside withdrawal rates, at greater than 7%, seem higher than the more standard 3% to 5% withdrawal rates developed from research by William Bengen. This is due to a 20-year retirement horizon considered, the favorable market environment from 1976 to 2016 (with double-digit average equity returns), and because we use an all-equity strategy for simplicity of presentation.
This investor might perceive the dividend-payers index, at 8.1%, to be the safest option, since it would support a higher maximum withdrawal rate over these worst-case periods. The large-cap index would have been the least attractive investment for a retiree since the safest maximum withdrawal rate, 7.8%, was nearly a half a percent less per year than the dividend-payers option. While conventional wisdom suggests that the broad, market-cap weighted portfolio is most diversified, it may not have the lowest risk for all investors.
If not volatility, then what?
Early research on asset allocation argued that investment choice is simply a tradeoff between expected return and volatility, if asset returns are symmetrical (bell shaped) and independent through time (Samuelson, 1963; Campbell & Viceira, 2001).
Both assumptions seem straightforward but, as research has shown, these assumptions rarely hold in practice (Pettengill, Sundaram, & Mathur, 1995; Lettau & Wachter, 2007).
Investors in high-yield bonds receive a periodic coupon, but could lose all their money if the firm borrowing money defaults. Similarly, the value of a 10-year Treasury note can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time, but it offers a certain (risk-free) payout over a 10-year period.
More importantly, departures from typical assumptions have a critical impact on investment suitability. Large losses are compounded in retirement as periodic withdrawals become larger proportions of declining assets, and can cause permanent depletion. Conversely, investors saving for retirement have longer holding periods, and can afford to ride out periods of temporary stress.
The table below captures these key aspects of investment results for the three indexes considered. We report “traditional” measures of average return and volatility, along with two additional “objective-based” metrics. First, downside capture measures the average return of each of the indexes in periods where the market (defined here as the S&P 500) has negative returns, and is an intuitive way to understand potential for large losses. The MSCI USA High Dividend Yield Index has only 69% downside capture, compared to 100% for Ibbotson Small Cap, and so it naturally offered lower risk of asset depletion from withdrawals.
Second, long-horizon risk is the ratio of the volatility calculated using 20-year annualized returns to the volatility calculated using monthly returns. This provides an intuitive understanding of mean reversion and how volatility may smoothen out over longer periods of time. Values less than 100% imply less risk over longer holding periods, and values greater than 100% imply more risk over longer holding periods.
The Ibbotson Small Cap Index has had long-horizon risk of 54%, illuminating why, despite higher short-term volatility, it produced excellent outcomes for investors accumulating savings. These measures have historically been confined to academic discourse; our research suggests that they should become more mainstream (Ramkumar, Hammond, & Bell, 2017).
Expanding conventional practice
Our case studies are not meant to be recommendations of which asset class or index to invest in. In fact, the results can vary depending on the index used, and index characteristics themselves can change through time. For example, the downside capture of the MSCI High Dividend Yield Index increased materially during the credit crisis. Our objective instead is to highlight why it is important for advisors to reframe the portfolio construction conversation around client goals, and how advisors can expand on traditional practice. This summarized in the table below:
How to expand portfolio construction in an objective-based framework
First, investors and their advisors should view risk not just as annual volatility of portfolios, but instead as the likelihood of undershooting goals. It is not enough to evaluate a client’s risk tolerance in the abstract. Instead, risk is inextricably linked to one’s goals, time horizon and life stage.
Second, just as investment risk varies with client goals, so too must the investment approach. As an example, portfolio construction for a client saving for retirement should employ investments that are different than for a client living in retirement. Investors have traditionally sought to reduce risk by simply reducing the amount of equity. Our research suggests there is value in also changing the type of equities.
Lastly, advisors usually select strategies that seek to match or beat market benchmarks. Our research suggests that they should also evaluate attributes like downside capture and long-horizon risk, which can positively impact investor outcomes.
These adjustments may seem daunting, but they are built on research that spans several decades and represent a clearer perspective on portfolio construction. They offer the opportunity for better client engagement and, most importantly, the potential for improved investor outcomes.

125,equity,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/tech-hijacking-stock-market.html,Tech is hijacking the stock market — here are 3 reasons why that’s OK,Technology & Innovation,"May 31, 2017","Tech’s weighting in U.S. markets is the highest it’s been since the tech-stock boom.
Valuations in tech are still compelling due to unique and powerful business models.
Expect tech stocks’ sway to increase as platform companies grow and gain market share.
Surging technology stocks – think Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet – are rapidly expanding their influence on the makeup and direction of the U.S. stock market. But while some might think this is a sign of excess or overvaluation, I suggest that, if anything, the sector’s influence will only intensify as the market appreciates these companies’ superior fundamentals and growth prospects.
There’s no denying tech stocks’ power. The market value weighting of information technology stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index stood at 23% at the end of April 2017, the highest level since the tech-stock boom in 2000, when it peaked at 34% in August 2000. Tech’s outsized role is even more pronounced in emerging markets, accounting for 30% of the market value of the MSCI China Investable Market Index (IMI) as of 2016. That’s up from less than 10% in 2000. And technology is the largest component in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
Individual tech stocks tell the same story, too. Mobile device maker Apple saw its market value top $800 billion this year, the first U.S. company to reach that height — meaning this one stock accounts for 4% of the S&P 500’s market value. Overseas, Chinese internet giants Tencent and Alibaba are among the world’s 10 most valuable companies and some of the biggest drivers of returns over the past year, based on the MSCI ACWI index.
My analysis shows tech’s already large influence can grow even further, because:
1. I Believe This Isn’t the Tech Bubble
Despite strong gains this year, tech stocks, specifically those in the internet space, offer value. Internet stocks’ price-to-earnings multiples are 140% higher than that of the S&P 500 based on 2018 estimates, but that number masks a more accurate picture of the opportunity. Internet companies’ free cash flow gives a truer picture of their ongoing financial power, as these companies trade at just a 55% premium to the market in free cash flow estimates for 2018, a reasonable price in my view for superior profitability. Internet companies’ return on invested capital, a measure of how much profit is driven from equity and debt invested in the company, is 26% higher than that of the S&P 500. Internet companies also enjoy valuation support due to holding 4% of their market value in net cash, as opposed to S&P 500 companies that carry net debt.
2. The Internet Is Still Growing Rapidly
Growth abounds in tech: internet companies are expected to see their profits grow three times faster than the S&P 500 the next five years. Interestingly, the internet companies growing the fastest can be bought at attractive valuations. Amazon.com, for instance, is expected to post compound average annual growth of more than 30% between 2016 and 2021, which outstrips all of its major internet industry peers. But the online retailer’s free cash flow multiple of 20 is still in line with, if not lower than, comparables.
3. Giant Tech Companies Can Get Even Bigger
The “winner takes most” dynamic of the internet — where the largest companies capture a majority of incremental business — creates opportunities for investors. This is what I call the platform paradox: companies are growing faster as they’re getting bigger.
Despite being among the most valuable internet companies, both Amazon and Facebook are also the fastest growing based on expected free cash flow increases between 2016 and 2021. These massive companies are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the large amounts of advertising and e-commerce that will still move online.
Technology has only begun to change businesses ranging from advertising to retail and travel. In a decade or two, there will probably be three to five trillion-dollar, and potentially multi-trillion-dollar, technology companies powering the digital economy.
Given this favorable backdrop, when I hear that only 23% of the market’s value is from technology, I think that number should be far higher. I think that number will be far higher.
Investors looking to capitalize on what could be a coming era of mega-technology companies can look at five American Funds with significant investments in the technology sector and/or the large technology companies:

International equities appear undervalued versus U.S. stocks.
Growth rates in Europe and Japan are showing signs of improvement.
Currency trends could provide a tailwind for international investing.
A powerful rally in U.S. stocks since the November elections has underscored a long-running trend in the financial markets: U.S. stocks have outpaced developed-market equities in Europe and Japan for 86 months on a rolling three-year basis. Despite the dominance of U.S. stocks during this seven-year period, there are many compelling reasons to remain invested in international stocks as part of a well-diversified portfolio.
It’s important to remember that financial markets are increasingly global in nature. That means companies headquartered in the U.S., Europe and Japan don’t necessarily generate most of their earnings there. Daimler and BMW, for instance, sell far more cars outside Germany — and outside Europe, for that matter — than they do within the confines of their homeland. Ditto for Japan’s Toyota, which counts the U.S. as its biggest market, and European bank HSBC, which does much more business in Asia.
Non-U.S. companies benefit from U.S. economic engine
Since 2008, shares of non-U.S. companies with significant exposure to the U.S. economy have done well, thanks in part to the country’s role as a global economic engine. Just a few of the powerhouse non-U.S. companies in that mix include: Nestlé, Novartis, Roche, Toyota, British American Tobacco and Anheuser-Busch InBev.
“This is why we invest in companies and not economies,” says Jody Jonsson, an equity portfolio manager at Capital Group. “There are many places in the world where we look for well-managed companies and remain optimistic about the potential for attractive returns — whether it’s the U.S., Europe, Japan or any number of emerging markets.”
“No matter where you look to invest,” Jonsson continues, “there will always be questions about economic growth, government policies or political change. But the opportunities are there, despite the political or economic challenges faced by a particular country or region.”
Europe and Japan picking up the pace
With that said, it doesn’t hurt to have some economic tailwinds. There are signs that gross domestic product (GDP) growth is improving in Europe and Japan, boosted by central bank stimulus programs and ultra-low interest rates.
The Bank of Japan estimates that GDP growth will accelerate to 1.4% this year, from 1% previously, and to 1.5% in 2018, supported by stimulus measures, increased government spending, and rising demand for Japanese exports to the U.S, Europe and China.
The 19-member euro zone, meanwhile, has experienced a substantial rebound since the recessionary years of 2012–13. The Euro-Zone Purchasing Managers’ Index, a good indicator of future GDP growth trends, signals even higher growth in the months ahead. Euro-zone GDP growth stood at 1.7% for the calendar year 2016, roughly the same as the U.S. rate. That’s the first time the euro zone has kept pace with the U.S. economy since the start of the 2008–09 financial crisis.
Currency trends: An improving outlook
In recent years, a strong and rising U.S. dollar has hurt investment returns at times for dollar-based investors in European and Japanese equities. But here, too, there are signs that these currency trends could be shifting back toward historical norms. While it’s always difficult to call a top, the dollar appears to be about 10% overvalued, based on the fundamentals, and it therefore could be on course to weaken against the euro and the yen later this year and into next year, says Capital Group currencies analyst Jens Søndergaard.
“A more stable currency environment should help dollar-based investors when they convert from local currency returns,” Søndergaard explains. “This could provide a nice tailwind for international equities, even though it may put some pressure on the earnings of export-oriented companies that have benefited from a weakening euro or yen.”
Clearing the political air
Another cloud hanging over international equities, particularly in Europe, is the upcoming federal elections in France and Germany. Protectionist, nationalist and anti-immigration movements in Europe have gained some momentum following the U.K.’s Brexit vote in June and Donald Trump’s rise to the U.S. presidency.
Of course, the outcome of these crucial elections remains to be seen. But if extremist candidates stay on the fringes, as expected, then that could set the stage for a rebound in European stocks, says Capital Group political economist Talha Khan. “Financial markets will fret over the short-term uncertainty, but once we are past the French and German elections, we should have a better sense of the path ahead.”
Valuations look attractive
The U.S. stock market rally has created one other interesting trend to watch: U.S. company valuations are relatively high, compared to some European and Japanese companies, meaning bargain-hunting investors should at least be mindful of the relative-value opportunities. Certain companies in Europe and Japan are trading at a significant discount to their U.S. competitors, especially in the banking and oil & gas sectors.
For instance, U.S.-based banking giant JPMorgan Chase trades at a significantly higher price — based on a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio — than French bank BNP Paribas. JPMorgan’s P/E ratio is 13, verses 9 for BNP, as of February 24, 2017. Among oil companies, U.S.-based Exxon Mobil carries a P/E ratio of 19, while the U.K.’s Royal Dutch Shell trades at 14 and France’s Total stands at 12.
This can’t go on forever, can it?
From an investor-psychology perspective, it may feel like U.S. stocks will outshine international stocks forever. However, based on historical price trends, that is unlikely to be the case. The chart below shows the cyclical tendencies of U.S. stocks versus international stocks. Indeed, there were significant time periods when U.S. stocks were the laggards, such as the period after the collapse of the technology stock bubble — or much of the 1980s, a decade when Japan’s “economic miracle” sent Japanese stocks soaring to record highs.
“One of the interesting things about being in this business for more than 30 years is that I’ve lived through a few cycles where the U.S. has been the best market, and a few cycles where it hasn’t,” says Rob Lovelace, an equity portfolio manager with Capital Group. “It seems to take about five to seven years before people will throw in the towel and say, ‘I can’t recommend investing here anymore.’”
“While that sentiment is understandable, in my view, investors shouldn’t lock themselves into one geography,” Lovelace adds. “There are great companies all over the world. Our job is to find them, and invest in them, regardless of where they are domiciled.”

Technology stocks have long been thought of as investments into the potential growth of a company and less as an investment for those seeking income. However, this thinking is changing as a growing number of technology companies are paying dividends. The percentage of MSCI USA technology stocks paying dividends has nearly tripled during the past 16 years, while emerging markets and EAFE technology stocks have shown a similar trend.

The U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates aggressively to fight inflation, battering both equity and fixed income investments. By year-end, those efforts helped to bring inflation from a peak of 9.1% in mid-2022 to 6.0% in February 2023, as measured by the Consumer Price Index.
For fixed income investors, the worst may be behind us. Fed funds futures — the market’s expectations of the federal funds rate — reflect a terminal (peak) rate around 5.0% by midyear. The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions trade federal funds (balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other overnight. While stocks remain volatile and the possibility of recession weighs on the minds of investors, that light at the end of the tunnel helped bonds to realize some positive returns for a few months in the wake of the turmoil. Following the collapse of SVB Financial, parent company of Silicon Valley Bank, and other banking sector pressures, lending has tightened. This may result in the Fed's monetary policy having a more meaningful impact on slowing economic growth.
As the International Monetary Fund signals slowing growth and the economy potentially enters a period of market contraction, municipal bonds could be a relative bright spot. Munis offer strong fundamentals, have historically held up well versus other asset classes during periods of market difficulty and can now provide strong income to help cushion price volatility.

Strength in numbers: Munis dig deep with meaningful fundamental data
The federal government disbursed billions of dollars to state, local and tribal governments via pandemic relief programs. By doing so according to formulas rather than state by state, the funds benefited all states to a degree, even helping lead some (like California) to report budget surpluses.
State balance sheets matter to the general obligation (GO) portion of the municipal market. These bonds typically provide municipalities with funding for varied needs, paid back by property, income and sales taxes. Another category of munis, revenue bonds, fund specific projects and are paid back by related revenue streams.
Many states now face a boon, which is good news for GOs. The National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO) reports fiscal 2021 delivered record-breaking increases in general fund revenue and spending in fiscal 2022. According to NASBO, “States [in aggregate] saw two consecutive years of double-digit percentage revenue growth and collections far exceeding budget forecasts in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.”
State tax revenues at record highs

Despite healthy balance sheets, credit research remains essential, notes Karl Zeile, fixed income portfolio manager for The Tax-Exempt Bond Fund of America®. “Analyzing the strength of sector trends as well as issuer fundamentals is key to uncovering opportunities that can enhance a portfolio.”
For revenue bonds, the impact of interest rates is a two-sided coin. On one side, issuers came to market and borrowed at very low rates. This locked in a relatively low fixed cost for them to finance capital expenditures and infrastructure. Unlike corporate bonds, munis also typically don’t require refinancing on a regular basis. Muni projects come to market with decades-long, fixed-rate debt issuance aligned to the useful life of the project.
Now flip the coin for those issuers: Inflation results in rising revenues from these projects. Toll roads are an example of this. “When the toll price increases, greater revenues provide an incremental cushion against a fixed debt service cost. Issuers with growing revenues and low fixed costs can create attractive opportunities for muni bond managers,” Zeile explains.
Munis positioned for resilience in a recessionary environment
According to Moody’s Investors Service, broadly speaking, defaults have been rare for municipals. The average five-year U.S. municipal default rate since 2012 is 0.1%, in contrast to the average five-year global corporate default rate of 7.2% (Moody's Investors Service, April 21, 2022). But their potential resilience is even more notable in a contracting economy.
”Should we enter a recession, it does not seem likely to be driven by the excesses of a bubble,"" Zeile says. “It would potentially be a more traditional recession. I would expect equities to experience a correction due to the pressure on earnings. The job market may weaken, causing a cash crunch for consumers, and economic growth would further contract. We can’t predict the depth or length of a recession, but historically, munis have shown strong recovery after recessionary periods.”
Munis historically have recovered amid recession

Municipal credit quality is supported by an important economic benefit in recessions: Muni-related services are typically the “last skipped bill” as most revenue bonds, which make up approximately two-thirds of the muni market, are supported by essential services that tend to have high collection rates and thus are less sensitive to economic indicators.
“When recession knocks at the door with a car payment, credit card and a water bill due, everyone wants the ability to take a shower. People might not dine out at a restaurant, but they will open their wallets for water, electricity and gas to avoid shut-off,” says Greg Ortman, an investment director focused on the municipal bond market.
“Trash isn’t trash,” Ortman adds. “For-profit companies, such as those in waste management, hold contracts with local city governments, and they issue muni debt to help finance operations. Trash pickup has been very recession resistant, and it’s typically a much higher priority than a store credit card.”
The same principle applies for GO property taxes. Property taxes fund schools, police, parks and other local infrastructure. People may want to go on a shopping spree to decorate their home, but they need to pay their property taxes to keep their home.
In a recession, munis also tend to have a benefit shared by other fixed income sectors with interest rate sensitivity. The Fed could start cutting rates as the economy falters. Bond prices move inversely to interest rates. Falling interest rates would drive up bond prices, creating a tailwind for municipals.
This doesn’t mean every muni receives an automatic gold star. During the pandemic, some transportation agencies faced significant declines in ridership, resulting in significantly more volatility than in a traditional market.
“As we analyze sectors and sense weakness, we may shift holdings. Health care, and certainly hospitals, represent essential services. But are they as strong as they were before the pandemic? In broad strokes, I am a bit concerned about health care for a combination of reasons: the soaring cost of nursing care and a nursing shortage that does not have an easy fix. It’s expensive to hire, and you can’t train someone in two weeks. Even with those considerations, selectivity is possible. For example, to skirt some risk and consider credit quality, investigate a multi-state system or an integrated provider versus a single-site, standalone hospital,” Zeile says.
Higher income can serve as a shock absorber
Should volatility move center stage once again, munis have another advantage: Bond yields are near or above decade highs. The Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index began 2023 2.5 percentage points higher than the start of 2022. The lack of income provided by munis at the start of last year is part of the reason returns were so dire once rates began sharply rising. The bonds had very little income return to cushion the negative price return impacts from rising rates.
Municipal yields higher now than in the past decade
Sources: Capital Group, Bloomberg. Data as of 03/31/23. Yield represented by Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
A painful road? Yes, but today’s rates can furnish greater shock absorption. If unexpected shocks hit markets and impact munis, the likelihood of negative returns is more distant with a stronger income component to soften the blow. The yield to worst of the Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index (representing the broad muni market) was 3.25% at the end of March. For periods when the yield was in this range (+/– 0.3%), the five-year forward return was 4.3% (according to an analysis of Bloomberg data over the past 20 years). When investing at yields observed in recent months, munis have traditionally experienced solid returns.
Contracting markets result in anxious investors, even if it’s part of the normal market cycle. You can’t have an expansion without the rubber band eventually snapping back. In recessionary periods, many high-quality bond sectors may fare well relative to equities. However, munis offer some unique advantages, including strong fundamentals, distinctive characteristics that provide some resistance to recessionary impact and higher current yields to act as a buffer. For investors seeking tax-exempt income, munis warrant consideration, particularly if growth continues to slow and recession fears grow.

134,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/svb-collapse-changes-fed-calculus.html,How SVB’s collapse changes the Fed’s calculus,Monetary Policy,"March 16, 2023","With the volatility in markets in the wake of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and other events, we have been asked by clients about our views on monetary policy and evolving views in bond portfolios. Here, we share a Q&A with Tim Ng, a portfolio manager in American Funds® Strategic Bond Fund and other rates-oriented strategies as well as a member of our fixed income interest rates team.
Given recent regional bank failures and the stress in the banking system more broadly, what is your overall view of the macro situation and monetary policy?
The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank reflected various factors. Many of these were arguably idiosyncratic, but there were also broader macro aspects that resulted from tighter financial conditions stemming from one of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s most aggressive hiking cycles in decades. We are also seeing some stress in Europe amid questions around Credit Suisse bank. The situation remains quite fluid but will likely result in even tighter financial conditions, particularly as bank lending slows and regulatory scrutiny increases. All else equal, I believe this will have a negative effect on economic growth, and the likelihood of recession has increased.
What does this mean for the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, especially the path of interest rates?
The scope for the Fed to raise rates aggressively has narrowed dramatically with the recent developments in the banking sector. Only a couple of weeks ago, markets were pricing in more rate hikes and a higher terminal rate. I don’t expect the central bank to keep that pace. But I do think it will maintain a hawkish posture unless and until the economic outlook deteriorates materially. Inflation is still well above the Fed’s target and labor markets remain tight, as the latest economic data shows. The consumer is humming along. So looking at both sides of the picture, my expectation is that the Fed will temper its approach to rate hikes in the next few months and be more cautious. At the next meeting on March 22, I expect the central bank to raise the fed funds rate 25 basis points to a target range of 4.75% to 5.0%, and then assess the data and financial market conditions. In my view, there is a reasonable probability we will see a peak in the federal funds rate in the next few months.
Do you expect the Fed to cut rates later in the year?
I put a 50% probability on the Fed cutting rates in the second half of the year. The Fed is in an increasingly difficult position whereby inflation appears stubbornly high, but economic risks and challenges to financial market stability are rising. In my view, SVB is the first casualty of tighter monetary policy, and I believe others may follow as the Fed remains focused on curbing inflation.
How does this impact positioning in core and core plus bond portfolios?
We have been positioned for a steepening of the yield curve in several of our bond portfolios. This positioning has been additive given the market repricing we have seen with short-term Treasury yields rallying more than intermediate- and longer-term maturities. We still favor a yield curve steepener on the expectation that the Fed will eventually ease monetary policy as economic growth slows and inflation comes down. We have generally preferred yield curve steepeners over outright duration positions as we see greater return potential in yield curve positioning given how inverted the Treasury curve is by historical standards.
We have been relatively more cautious on credit in most core bond and core plus bond portfolios. Given the potential spillover effect from regional bank issues, we have seen some pressure on credit spreads, and this could continue, particularly if a recession becomes imminent. The bull case for credit markets is that the Fed eases and provides that support. But given its inflation mandate, and where inflation is today, the Fed is unlikely to support risk markets with monetary easing as quickly as it has in the past, which suggests a wider range of outcomes for spread products.

135,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/3-reasons-60-40-portfolios-comeback.html,3 reasons why 60/40 portfolios may make a comeback,Asset Allocation,"February 2, 2023","The death of the 60/40 portfolio has been greatly exaggerated.
Ask your search engine, “Is the 60/40 portfolio dead?” and it will generate about half a million results, many of them published recently. Following a difficult year for both stocks and bonds, the increased interest is understandable.
The 60/40 portfolio — shorthand for a diversified portfolio built with 60% equities and 40% fixed income — is intended to generate solid returns while minimizing risk. This did not happen in 2022, as stocks and bonds declined in tandem.
Investors expressed their disappointment with their dollars, withdrawing $43.6 billion from strategies in Morningstar’s “Allocation — 50% to 70% Equity” category in 2022. That followed a period when investors withdrew billions from such strategies in six of seven years for different reasons, including when stock markets were soaring.
“We saw a lot of folks exit balanced strategies in 2022,” says Hilda Applbaum, an equity portfolio manager for American Balanced Fund®. “While there is a lot of wisdom in markets, there also is a herd mentality. I believe many investors have become disbelievers in balanced strategies at the wrong time. I am confident that, going forward, balanced portfolios — whether they are a 60/40 split or 65/35 — may continue to be a successful approach for most investors over the long term.”

Data as of 12/31/2022.
Below, Applbaum, who invests in both stocks and bonds, and David Hoag, a fixed income portfolio manager with The Bond Fund of America®, share three reasons they believe conditions today are more favorable for balanced investing, as well as perspective on how they see balanced approaches evolving.

Reason #1: 2022 was an anomaly, not the norm
Last year stands out as the only time in the past 45 years that both stocks and bonds declined in tandem for a full calendar year. “The culprit for the chaos in both stocks and bonds last year was the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes,” Hoag says. “I think it’s very reasonable to say that bonds will go back to offering diversification benefits as we near the end of the tightening cycle.”
Applbaum says such correlation between the two asset classes won’t likely repeat soon. “With stocks and bonds correlated in terms of their returns, I believe last year reflected an inflection point, not a new normal,” she says.
Most investors had never faced a year as challenging as 2022

Stock returns represented by the S&P 500 Index. Bond returns represented by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
Once the Fed gets inflation under reasonable control, it will have more flexibility, and investors can likely expect bond markets to zig when stock markets zag.
Reason #2: Attractive income is back in fixed income
If there’s a silver lining to the aggressive Fed action, it’s that most classes of bonds are offering significantly higher yields than a year ago. The yield on the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index, a widely used benchmark for investment-grade (BBB/Baa and above) bond markets, was 4.25% as of January 25, 2023. That compares to 1.75% on December 31, 2021. The yields for the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Investment Grade Index and Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High Yield Index stood at 4.96% and 8.16%, respectively, on January 25.
Dating back to the 2008–2009 global financial crisis, historically low rates meant that investors were not able to count on bonds to make much of a contribution to a portfolio’s total return. But with bonds offering higher potential income today, investors may be able to take less risk with their equity investments and still meet their return expectations.
“Today many core bonds can provide a dependable return in the mid-single digits,” Applbaum says. “And investors who are comfortable taking a little more risk by including some investment-grade and high-yield bonds can look for their bond portfolios to potentially contribute even more to a portfolio’s total return. That means you can take less risk with respect to your allocation to stocks in your pursuit of income and total return.”
Reason #3: Dividends can make a difference
If a bond portfolio can provide mid-single digit returns or better, dividends can potentially contribute to an attractive overall return picture within a portfolio’s equity allocation — without taking undue risk.
Historically, dividend-paying stocks have tended to be less volatile than growth stocks. And although dividends accounted for a slim 16% of total return for the S&P 500 Index in the 2010s, historically they have contributed an average 38% from January 1, 1926, to November 30, 2022. In the inflationary 1970s, they climbed to more than 70%.
Many investor portfolios don’t focus on dividend payers
Sources: Capital Group, FactSet and Morningstar. Totals may not reconcile due to rounding. The average advisor portfolio is representative of the aggregate exposures of 543 portfolios analyzed by Capital Group’s Portfolio Consulting and Analytics team from 10/1/2022 to 12/31/2022. The American Funds Moderate Growth and Income Model Portfolio represents the most recent available data calculated as of 12/31/2022. This model aligns closely to the broad asset allocation of the average advisor portfolio.
“For the first time in a long time, I get to talk about the importance of dividends in terms of shareholder returns,” says Applbaum. “When interest rates were zero, companies really didn't have to think about their cost of capital. They could have lower hurdle rates in terms of returns on investment. Now that capital isn’t free they must be more thoughtful about how they can get the best return on investment, in addition to being thoughtful about when it makes more sense to return money to shareholders in the form of dividends.”
Bottom line: Look for better returns, lower risk in 2023
There are several reasons investors can expect a 60/40 portfolio to deliver better potential returns and lower volatility in 2023 and beyond. Bonds today are offering higher yields than a year ago, and with the Fed taking a less aggressive approach to rate hikes lately, interest rate volatility will likely be more muted. Valuations across a range of stocks are more attractive than they were a year ago as well.
But it is important to remember that there is more to balanced investing than deciding on how much equity and how much fixed income to include in a portfolio. “These aren’t monolithic allocations,” explains Applbaum. “For example, growth stocks and dividend payers offer very different risk-reward profiles. So successful balanced investing depends not simply on how much equity is in a portfolio but also what kind of equity is in a portfolio.”
A balanced portfolio would have outpaced other strategies over the past 16 years
Sources: Capital Group, Bloomberg Index Services Ltd., FTSE Russell, ICE Benchmark Administration Ltd., MSCI, Refinitiv Datastream, Standard & Poor's. Returns figures are as of December 31, 2022. ""Buy the dip"" strategy represents buying the prior year's worst performing asset class every year. ""Ride the wave"" strategy represents buying the prior year's best performing asset class every year. ""Balanced portfolio"" strategy represents maintaining a 60/40 split between U.S. large cap stocks (represented by the S&P 500 Index) and U.S. core bonds (represented by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index). This assumes the portfolios are rebalanced annually. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods. 
“Last year many types of asset allocation models failed to deliver on their pursuit of solid returns with moderate risk,” Applbaum adds. “But that followed a long period of relative success. Asset allocation is not a broken or failed strategy. It will always make sense to think about balance, diversification and risk in portfolios. But a one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t work. It’s about building portfolios from the bottom up that align with investor objectives.”

Diversification and the 60/40 portfolio
Investors who fled volatile stock markets in 2022 faced a new problem: Bonds weren’t offering the stability they had expected. The year-long stretch of both stocks and bonds posting losses left many investors questioning the relevance of the 60% equities/40% bonds portfolio and whether bonds could still provide diversification from equity market downturns.
The profound pessimism in markets globally was tied to central banks raising rates to rein in decades-high inflation. The pain was acute with both the S&P 500 Index and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index down double digits. The losses were also unique, with 2022 being the only time in 45 years that stocks and bonds declined in tandem.
“Last year was very disappointing since bonds didn’t do what people expected, but at the same time, it was what the Fed needed to happen to bring inflation down,” Hoag explains. “The culprit for the chaos in both stocks and bonds last year was the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes. I think it’s reasonable to say that bonds will go back to offering diversification benefits as we near the end of the tightening cycle.”

Bond funds are also offering more income and higher return potential. The yield on the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, a widely used benchmark for investment-grade (BBB/Baa and above) bond markets, ended 2022 at 4.68% compared to a yield of 1.75% on December 31, 2021. The total return of a bond fund consists of distributions, price changes and interest paid, and the latter has been rising.
With high returns potential from core bond funds, investors may not need to take as many risks in their equity or bond portfolios, Hoag says. “The magic today is that core bond funds offer more cushion from the income component compared to the start of last year.”
This also means that even amid modest price or interest rate volatility it may be easier to achieve a positive total return in 2023.
Despite the very low yields that investors have faced since the 2007–2008 global financial crisis, healthier income from bonds like we see today is closer to the historical norm. In the past three decades — which includes periods of price or interest rate volatility — core bond total returns were driven predominantly from the interest or coupon component, not price changes.

Inflation has declined but the Fed can’t declare victory
Whether Fed officials feel confident that they have vanquished inflation is important. The last few months have offered some relief as inflation rates declined from their peak, which has allowed central banks to slow their rate hikes. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services, rose 6.5% in the year through December, down from 7.1% for the 12 months through November. The Fed’s preferred core inflation measure, which strips out food and energy prices, slowed annually to 5.7% in December from 6.0% a year earlier.
“I see core CPI continuing to decline this year to a range of 3.5% to 4.0%, which is still above the Fed’s 2.0% target level,” says Timothy Ng, fixed income portfolio manager for American Funds Inflation Linked Bond Fund®.
Pandemic-related supply chain disruptions were a big contributor to high inflation in 2022, and that problem has largely dissipated. The demand for workers also fed into higher prices since companies passed on to consumers the increased costs of hiring. There are signs that the worker shortage is beginning to improve, and more companies have paused hirings or announced layoffs.
“Still, the Fed can’t declare victory yet, and the fine-tuning that’s going to happen may be a source of volatility in the market overall,” Ng notes.

Signs of an economic slowdown … or a recession?
What’s next for policymakers is a thorny question. Rapid rate hikes are necessary to cool inflation, but too much tightening could severely hurt the economy and job figures.
Investors don’t expect a repeat of the same interest rate volatility that hit bond markets in 2022. Inflation is moving in the right direction, and the Fed has already dialed down the pace of hikes, giving officials time to see their policy impact on the broader economy.
Assuming growth continues to deteriorate, the market expects the Fed to pivot from rate hikes to rate cuts in late 2023. Such a dramatic move would positively impact bond prices, as yields would begin to fall. That’s a major reason why high-quality bonds tend to provide diversification from equities: The Fed swoops in to ease policy as stocks get hammered by a sagging economy.
Rate expectations have dramatically changed from 2022

“Investors have been buying Treasuries in part because they expect a mild recession,” Hoag says. The market is also expecting rates to decline by year-end since the Fed may want to get to a rate that is considered “neutral,” or a place where policy is neither stimulating nor restricting economic growth, as the economy weakens further.
Signs of a slowing economy have started to appear beyond a decreased demand for housing. Consumers have begun to pull back on buying cars, furniture and even fuel with retail sales down 1.1% in December compared to the prior month, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Producer Price Index, which reflects inflation at the supplier level, also slowed in December to 6.2% from 7.3% the previous month.
“Once there are some weaknesses, they tend to snowball — and above a certain threshold, it usually means the economy is in a recession,” says Ng.
Under this scenario, actively managed core bond funds that hold high-quality bonds will likely do better than those that hold lower rated debt.
“I’m finding more value in high-quality mortgages rather than investment-grade corporate bonds since I am concerned that the Fed may have already gone too far and tightened by too much,” Hoag says.
The search for stability amid volatility
After a series of jumbo rate hikes, the Fed has entered a new phase of smaller increases that give officials time to consider the impact of higher borrowing costs.
“With inflation finally coming down, the likelihood that bond markets experience another year of massive hikes in 2023 is very low,” Ng adds. This is a welcome scenario for bond investors, as it means core bond funds could again offer diversification benefits.
“Economic indicators are dropping from the heavy lifting the Fed did last year, and there’s bound to be stock market volatility. If we enter a recession, policymakers could look to rate cuts, which could help boost returns for core bond funds,” Hoag notes.

138,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/2023-bond-market-outlook.html,Bond market outlook: Prospects brighten as Fed slows hikes,Bonds,"December 15, 2022","Bond markets had a difficult year in 2022 as the Fed aggressively hiked interest rates to stamp out inflation. With the end of rate increases in sight, investors may be wondering if volatility may be replaced with relative tranquility in the year ahead.
At its December meeting, the U.S. Federal Reserve moderated its approach and lifted rates by half a percentage point to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. Investors welcomed the downshift after an unprecedented string of four 75 basis point adjustments by policymakers attempting to quash decades-high inflation. But officials underscored that they will continue to raise rates to around 5% next year.
Wide-ranging challenges still lie ahead. Among them: Inflation remains stubbornly high, and economic activity is expected to slow or contract.
Here, fixed income portfolio managers from across Capital Group weigh in about what’s next for bonds.
Inflation has likely peaked, but should remain high
Even the most optimistic investors are bracing for a recession. The question is more a matter of how wide or deep the downturn will be as central banks worldwide raise rates to try to contain inflation. With growth expected to stall or contract in major economies including the United Kingdom, European Union, Japan and the United States, will high prices stick around in 2023?
Inflation remains high in most economies
Source: Refinitiv Datastream. U.S. data as of 11/30/22. Data for other countries/regions is current as of 10/31/22. Consumer Price Index (CPI), a commonly used measure of inflation, measures the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and services.
Demand for sectors that quickly absorb rate increases, such as housing, has predictably declined. Other areas of the economy will take more time to cool.
“The impact of rate hikes will unfold over the next several months, likely in the form of higher unemployment, fewer job openings and declining retail sales,” says Ritchie Tuazon, portfolio manager for American Funds Strategic Bond FundSM.
So far, the economy has coped surprisingly well. Ironically, bright spots could feed into the inflation problem.
“Supply chain issues appear to have worked themselves out, but the labor shortage and persistent wage growth could keep inflation higher than the Fed’s 2% target range for some time,” Tuazon says. Geopolitical risks could further undermine the Fed’s efforts.
“There is a flavor of stagflation ahead,” Tuazon adds. Stagflation, the much-feared mix of stagnant economic growth, high unemployment and soaring prices, warrants an active approach to bond investing. “I see select opportunities within the Treasury yield curve as well as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities.”

Bond funds should once again offer relative stability
Fixed income's role as a portfolio ballast when stocks are falling was of no help as the Fed continuously revised rate expectations upward.
It’s rare for both stocks and bonds to fall in tandem in a calendar year. In fact, 2022 marks the only time it occurred in 45 years. That’s because the Fed hiked aggressively when rates were near zero.
Stocks and bonds rarely decline in tandem
Sources: Capital Group, Bloomberg Index Services Ltd., MSCI. Returns above reflect annual total returns in USD for all years except 2022, which reflect the year-to-date total return for both indexes. As of 11/30/22. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
That should change in 2023 as inflation moderates. “Once the Fed pivots from its ultra-hawkish monetary policy stance, high-quality bonds should again offer relative stability and greater income,” according to Pramod Atluri, portfolio manager for The Bond Fund of America®.
As additional cracks start to show in the economy, recession fears may take center stage. “One way or another, the consumer is going to feel more stressed in 2023. Either the economy is so strong it continues to feed into inflation, or the economy weakens and unemployment rises,” Atluri says.
But slowing growth and moderating inflation could be a good thing for high-quality fixed income. They should lead to lower yields and higher bond prices. Staying on the sidelines to wait out market volatility could mean giving up on income opportunities and the potential for an even higher total return. “Valuations are attractive, so I am selectively adding corporate credit,” Atluri says. “Bonds now offer a much healthier income stream, which should help offset any price declines.”
Investing six months prior to the final rate hike would have provided strong returns
Sources: Capital Group, Bloomberg. Right chart shows date of the last hike in all Fed hiking periods since 1980, excluding the 2018 peak which does not yet have five years of data. Hypothetical 12-month dollar cost average return is the total return for a level monthly investment for 12 months starting six months prior to each last rate hike. The hypothetical five-year return annualizes the total return for that first 12 months plus four more years, assuming no additional investment after that first year. Regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss. Investors should consider their willingness to keep investing when share prices are declining. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
Historically, investing prior to the final rate hike in a cycle would have paid off. In the last 40 years, there were six hiking cycles that offer five years of returns data. Purchasing bonds regularly for a year starting six months prior to the last Fed rate hike in each of those cycles would have returned a range of 3.3% to 10.2% in the first 12 months. Longer term, that year-long investment would have provided a five-year annualized total return that spanned from 5.9% to 15.6%.
Income is back in fixed income
Bond market losses can be painful to endure, as rising rates cause bond prices to decline. The upside is that bond yields also rise, which may set the stage for higher income down the road.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury hovered around 3.47% on December 14, 2022, versus a yield of 1.51% on December 31, 2021. Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, have soared across sectors. Over time, income should increase since the total return of a bond fund consists of price changes and interest paid, and the interest component is higher.
Yields have soared across asset classes
Sources: Bloomberg, Bloomberg Index Services Ltd., JPMorgan. As of 11/30/22. Sector yields above include Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index, Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Investment Grade Index, Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High Yield Index, 50% J.P. Morgan EMBI Global Diversified Index/50% J.P. Morgan GBI-EM Global Diversified Index blend and Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index. Period of time considered from 2020 to present. Dates for recent lows from top to bottom in chart shown are: 8/4/20, 12/31/20, 7/6/21, 1/4/21 and 7/27/21. Yields shown are yield to worst. Yield to worst is the lowest yield that can be realized by either calling or putting on one of the available call/put dates or holding a bond to maturity. ""Change"" figures may not reconcile due to rounding.
With investors better compensated for holding relatively stable bonds, the question of whether to invest in riskier corporate or high-yield bonds ahead of a potential recession is an important one.
Despite gloomy headlines, consumers continue to open their wallets. “This has helped keep corporate balance sheets in pretty good shape,” says Damien McCann, fixed income portfolio manager for American Funds Multi-Sector Income FundSM.
The reward potential for corporate investment-grade bonds (BBB/Baa and higher) at current levels is enticing, but many are vulnerable in a downturn. “I expect credit quality to weaken as the economy slows. In that environment, I prefer defensive sectors such as health care over homebuilders and retail,” McCann says.
High-yield bonds are also relatively well positioned for an economic slowdown, and their prices have declined sharply. An uptick in defaults, which the market has already priced in, could still increase in a deep recession.
“We went through a significant default cycle with the pandemic,” says David Daigle, bond manager for American High-Income Trust®. “The underlying credit quality of the asset class has improved markedly since 2008. I do expect fundamentals to weaken from here so I’m positioning the funds I manage to have less exposure to consumer cyclicals such as automotive and leisure since demand for their products and services will likely soften.”
Municipal bonds are well positioned ahead of a downturn
The Fed-induced selloff sent municipal bond yields to near 15-year highs. For patient, long-term investors, that can make munis particularly attractive.
Historically, the allure of munis was their federal and often state tax-exempt status. Because of that, they generally have yielded less than comparable taxable bonds. Decades of low rates translated into modest income payments.
According to fixed income portfolio manager Karl Zeile, “Muni yields are reaching levels where the tax-exempt income is attractive.” The Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index was down 8.8% in 2022 (through November 30) and yielded 3.6%, which is the equivalent of a 6.0% yield for investors in the highest tax bracket. The highest tax rate assumes the 3.8% Medicare tax and the top federal marginal tax rate for 2022 of 37%.
Muni bond yields offer attractive entry point
Sources: Bloomberg Index Services Ltd. As of 11/30/22. Yields shown are yield to worst. Yield to worst is the lowest yield that can be realized by either calling or putting on one of the available call/put dates or holding a bond to maturity.
“Thanks to robust employment and significant aid through the American Rescue Plan, state balance sheets are broadly in good shape,” Zeile reports.
Revenues have increased for some project-specific bonds such as toll roads, colleges and universities since they were able to pass higher costs to consumers. These so-called revenue bond issuers tend to issue long-term debt, so many have low fixed debt payments.
Lower tax revenue and other negative recessionary impacts take longer to flow to munis compared to corporate credit and high-yield bonds.
With many opportunities in higher rated issuers, “valuations don’t yet reward the risk of going meaningfully down in credit quality,” Zeile adds.
Why bonds are back
After a difficult year for bonds, there are reasons for optimism. Inflation has moderated, and Fed rate hikes are likely to peak in the not-too-distant future. Higher yields and the specter of a recession could also send investors back into bonds in search of relative stability and income.
Today’s starting yields can offer an attractive entry point for investors and provide a cushion to further volatility. There are also compelling opportunities across asset classes that an active manager can uncover via bottom-up research and security selection.

Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable. While not directly correlated to changes in interest rates, the values of inflation linked bonds generally fluctuate in response to changes in real interest rates and may experience greater losses than other debt securities with similar durations. The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds. Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness.

140,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/securitized-credit-investing-themes.html,Securitized credit can be an important diversifier in bond portfolios,Bonds,"October 18, 2022","As the risk of recession looms large over financial markets, how will securitized credit fare? It’s a growing area of bond markets that has become an important anchor of some actively managed fixed income portfolios. Portfolio manager Xavier Goss, who manages securitized credit in American Funds® Multi-Sector Income Fund and American Funds® Strategic Bond Fund, discusses the reasons he remains optimistic on several areas of this market despite some near-term challenges.
The economic outlook is mixed
The U.S. Federal Reserve is obviously looking to bring inflation under control, which means we will likely see the economy slow down and unemployment go back up. But while tightening financial conditions should be a headwind, consumers have remained strong because of wage inflation and low unemployment, as well as the subsidies they received directly from the government. Therefore, even if we head into a recession, consumers are starting from a much better position than they were in the lead-up to the global financial crisis.
Overall, it is not a bad time to be looking at fixed income broadly. With the backdrop of rising unemployment and slower growth, I do expect defaults to increase from current low levels, but relatively tight underwriting standards and a stronger consumer should help mitigate downside risk. Additionally, the excess yields available from investment-grade (BBB/Baa and above) and high-yield corporate bonds are beginning to attract “crossover” investors who are dipping their toes into fixed income. There is a lot of cash in the system and new issuance is low. This could provide a nice backstop for the securitized market.
1. Asset-backed securities provide income, diversification
Securitized credit today is a large and diversified sector. At one end of the spectrum, you have asset-backed securities (ABS), comprising consumer credit such as student loans and auto loans. At the other end, you have commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), backed by loans on a variety of assets such as industrial warehouses, office buildings and retail malls. The securities are segmented into different credit ratings, depending on the level of collateralization (i.e., the value of the assets backing the loan) and/or their position in the capital structure.
Today in the portfolios I manage, the largest relative exposure in securitized credit is to asset-backed securities backed by consumer loans. I am optimistic about the continued strength of consumers’ balance sheets. Given where we are in the financial cycle, I prefer taking shorter duration credit risk in consumer loan sectors as opposed to longer duration commercial assets. ABS look attractive in this rising rate environment as they tend to have significantly shorter duration (meaning they are less vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations). These assets have tended to be good diversifiers and income generators for portfolios.
Consumers remain strong despite economic headwinds
Sources: New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel, Equifax. Data from 1/1/2003 through 6/30/2022.
In the coming years, I expect there will be significant divergence in performance across sectors. This should increase the opportunity to generate alpha through security selection. Bonds backed by subprime auto loans are a good example of asset-backed securities that have shorter duration and increased credit risk, depending on the originator of the loans. This is an area where credit research can add substantial value.
Private student loans are another example. Credit risk on these loans has come down marginally because of President Joe Biden’s move to provide debt relief to educational loan borrowers, though the program is being challenged in court. Private student loans are, of course, not being forgiven by the government, but it is common for students to have both a federal loan and a private loan. However, the debt relief on the federal loans should lighten the overall debt load, thus the credit risk on private loans should be lower. If the program receives approval to go ahead, it would likely provide a further catalyst for the sector.
Overall, the portfolios I manage are about a year-and-a-half to two years short spread duration versus their benchmarks. (Spread duration is a measure of how the price of an asset moves in relation to its credit spread.) I believe financial conditions will tighten further, and as a result, structured credit spreads need to widen from current levels. I try to keep the investment portfolios I manage balanced between income generation and total return. So, while the market is tilting toward a risk-off stance, I want to own a decent amount of assets that provide a strong revenue stream.
Even with the Fed tightening aggressively, I do not expect unemployment to spike significantly in the next 12 to 18 months. So, if I am buying a bond that matures in two to three years, I am comfortable going down in credit quality given the shorter maturities.
2. Select opportunities in CMBS despite retail headwinds
Commercial mortgage-backed securities are a different story from consumer ABS. These assets are longer duration in nature and closely tied to gross domestic product (GDP) growth and corporate profits. I currently favor the more senior part of the capital structure in CMBS. In a slowing economy, I don't really want to own long-duration intermediate-risk (mezzanine) tranches as they tend to be more vulnerable to slowing GDP growth.
While I remain cautious on CMBS overall, there are some corners of the market that still look attractive. In terms of the underlying collateral of these bonds, warehouses for companies like Amazon and other large retailers, data centers and industrial buildings have held up better, but there is still a lot of uncertainty in the office and retail sectors. Some companies are bringing their employees back to the office five days a week, which should be positive for CMBS. But it is impossible to project what the office sector will look like in the coming years. Lower office attendance has also meant less foot traffic in commercial city centers, which can be a headwind for retail. But even if the reopening brings more people into stores, the retail sector is still facing the same challenge it has faced for years with people shopping more online.
I see better opportunities in commercial mortgages in single-asset, single-borrower (SASB) deals, where instead of the bonds being backed by a broad portfolio of commercial real estate, it's just one asset or a small handful of assets. The majority of the total volume of deals coming to market this year have been SASBs. This is representative of a shift in investor preferences. Single-asset borrower deals are also easier to analyze than a traditional CMBS that contains multiple underlying assets. Currently, in portfolios I manage, the CMBS sleeves are almost equally split between SASBs and more traditional conduit deals backed by multiple properties.
Single-asset CMBS have gained significant market share

3. Managing risk in non-agency residential mortgages
In non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) assets, I currently prefer credit risk transfer securities, which are government-originated loans that have been offloaded to the private sector. I think the biggest potential headwinds in this sector are extension risk and a moderate increase in delinquencies as unemployment increases. With rising interest rates, borrowers are likely to extend their mortgages. Borrowers who received loans or refinanced their existing mortgages during the pandemic when rates were below 3% are unlikely to prepay any time soon. Relative to asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities need much greater management of duration and convexity risk.
I am also starting to look out for deteriorating underwriting standards. Broad market underwriting standards appear to have returned to pre-COVID-19 levels as certain lenders look to increase origination volumes to meet loan demand. However, as financial conditions tighten, I expect we will see significant bifurcation in terms of what loan originators will do.
Savvy originators are likely to tighten their underwriting standards, or at least keep them consistent and be willing to let their origination volume go down as a result. On every call that our analysts and I have with originators, we ask about their underwriting standards and their origination volumes. If their volumes are up in the last year, it is an immediate red flag.
Originators that have steady backing from long-term investors tend to accept that their origination volumes can decline 20% or more given current financial conditions. I expect any weakening of standards to first appear in private equity-funded issuers since many commercial banks have maintained a more conservative stance. 
Given this backdrop, I strongly believe that security selection will be a key driver of results in the coming years. We have a team of analysts that aims to sort the good originators from the bad ones.

4. Highly selective on CLOs
One of the key benefits of having securitized credit in a diversified fixed income portfolio is that it has a lower correlation with corporate credit. You can generate similar returns while getting decent diversification. Right now, I’m looking for relative value opportunities along the same lines I mentioned before: shorter duration credit in consumer loan sectors.
That's manifested itself in the portfolios I manage in an overweight position in consumer ABS. I am also looking to build a position in collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), although I am highly selective and opportunistic when investing in these securities. I think there is going to be an opportunity in CLOs, but for now there are a lot of technical headwinds. Valuations are relatively high and there are a significant number of loans sitting on dealer warehouse lines, which have not yet been securitized. U.S. and Japanese banks, which have historically been large investors in CLOs, are also dramatically reducing their demand due to recent changes in the regulatory environment for U.S. banks. Meanwhile, a strong U.S. dollar is reducing demand from Japanese banks. That leads me to believe spreads are likely to grind wider in the coming months. Given the above technical backdrop, potential purchases in the future will be very slow and deliberate.
5. Fundamentals are supportive of securitized credit
While an economic slowdown always increases risk, I am less worried about forced selling by leveraged investors than I have been in past cycles. Many securitized credit investors have been cautious on the market since the start of 2022 and are holding significant cash positions.
It is probably one reason credit spreads have held up relatively well despite the recent selloff in equities. Another factor supporting structured securities is that there is just not a lot of supply coming to market. New issuance in the corporate sector is down around 30% year over year; structured products supply is lower by around 50% relative to the prior year.
While the risks emanating from a weakening economy cannot be ignored, the securitized credit market appears to be in a pretty good spot overall from a fundamental perspective. I expect overall credit fundamentals to weaken, but security selection will be the key to alpha generation in the coming years. There will be ample opportunities to utilize our deep credit analysis to add value for clients.

The high-single-digit yields that the sector is offering are renewing investor interest in this asset class, even as the specter of a recession raises some concerns. We do not believe in timing this market.
History shows that when yields rise to the high-single-digit range, they tend not to stay that elevated for very long, as the discounted price and higher yields tend to draw in a broader cross section of investors. The carry (interest earned) that the high coupon provides also helps mitigate the risk of return volatility.
High-yield investors also benefit from cash flows arising from calls and tenders. This creates an ability to redeploy that cash in opportunities at potentially higher yields.
We discuss here five factors that make the case for investing in high yield and how we are approaching this market in a period of economic uncertainty, as well as when macro factors are having a large influence on markets.
There is no doubt that we are in an uncertain economic environment. We could also be in a recession that is in large part the result of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s aggressive stance on fighting inflation. As expected, the Fed raised interest rates by 75 basis points at its September meeting. But how soft or shallow will the recession be?
If the Fed’s actions are not successful in bringing down inflation, or if they push the economy into a longer, deeper recession, the high-yield market — and credit and risk assets more broadly — could face a bumpy ride.
One could argue that the negative scenario is reflected in prices already, given that returns for most areas of fixed income were in the negative high single digits through the end of August this year. On the other hand, if the Fed manages a “softer landing,” high-yield bonds could rally. Thus, it may make sense for investors to consider building exposure to high yield. We believe several areas of the market could be resilient. In this environment, our focus is on quality: For example, one of our largest high-yield portfolios is invested 34% in bonds rated BB and 40% in bonds rated B.
1.   Stronger fundamentals and lower issuance support valuations
Even with a softer macroeconomic backdrop, the high-yield market appears healthier and more stable than it has been in many years. We have a weaker economic environment but a stronger asset class, and the combination has resulted in yield spreads of around 480 basis points (bps) that are in line with historical averages, bringing the yield to worst on the benchmark Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High Yield 2% Issuer Capped Index to 8.4% as of the end of August.
High-yield spreads and yields are in line with their long-term averages

A second positive factor is the absence of near-term large-scale refinancing requirements. Savvy corporate management teams have tapped into the low-rate and favorable credit environment of the past few years to complete their financing requirements. Especially in 2021, companies were able to refinance their near-term debt at exceptionally low yields and push maturities out by several years.
As a result, corporate borrowers have entered this period of rising rates with financing that has been locked in for a few years. Because of that, many can sit on the sidelines today and do not need to issue new debt at prevailing higher rates. Many companies don’t need to tap capital markets or refinance until 2025, so the volume of issuance could remain low for at least another year, unless rates fall or high-yield spreads tighten.
Year to date through August, there has been about $92 billion in high-yield issuance, compared to approximately $366 billion for the same period last year. So, the opportunity set for us has shifted to the secondary market, where we are looking at relative value across capital structures and between issuers in the same industry, or even between industries.

We are concerned about the lower rated segment of high-yield companies that were waiting for their own prospects to improve before refinancing their debt. These firms may have missed the window to capture the lowest rates. While they represent a small segment of the high-yield market today, they also present us with opportunities to find solid companies seeking fresh capital that will now have to come with higher coupons.
Many borrowers have time to refinance and are sitting on the sidelines

2.   Default rates are likely to remain low
Also supporting the high-yield asset class are solid economic fundamentals, which should keep default rates relatively low. At less than 1%, the latest 12 months’ default rate is very low by historical standards. When we evaluate future default probabilities, we consider the amount of bonds that are trading at distressed levels because this can be an early indicator of future defaults. Today, distressed debt as a percentage of the high-yield universe is in the mid-single digits. Based on this metric, while we do expect the default rate to rise from very low levels, we are not forecasting a spike in defaults.
Another factor that we consider is the universe of high-yield debt that is rated triple-C or below. This too is around historical lows at about 12% of the high-yield market, compared to 20% in December 2007, prior to the recession following the global financial crisis. So, when we combine these three parameters — historically low default rates around 1%, triple-C and below-rated securities at about 12% of the market, and distressed debt stock in the mid-single digits as a percentage of the universe — it presents an overall supportive credit picture for the high-yield market.

3.    Risk of contagion from leveraged loan market is limited
The relationship between the high-yield and leveraged loan markets has evolved over the past decade. Historically, companies might have issued floating-rate loans as part of the secured portion of their capital structure, and separately issued fixed-rate unsecured bonds in the high-yield market. Today, many companies — often backed by private equity — that would have come to the high-yield market to finance themselves, have instead chosen to issue solely in the leveraged loan market. So, a lot of the risk traditionally associated with high-yield bond investing has migrated to the leveraged loan market. (Both the leveraged loan and private credit markets have expanded so rapidly that today their size, at about $1.2 trillion, is similar to that of the high-yield market.)
Companies that are tapping both the high-yield and the leveraged loan markets tend to be higher quality, larger firms issuing loans in conjunction with high-yield bonds, rather than to finance their entire capital structures. As a result, the high-yield market now is made up of stronger companies, based on credit ratings, and is also less exposed to private equity portfolio companies (which can be the most aggressively financed issuers in the debt markets).
Companies that are seeking to be upgraded to investment-grade (BBB/Baa and above) can be attractive because they not only present an opportunity to earn a high coupon today, but can also benefit from the price appreciation that often comes from a rating upgrade as and when it occurs. Several large issuers in the high-yield market today have only been high-yield issuers since they were downgraded from investment grade during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and they seek to return to the investment-grade market. In many high-yield portfolios, we also have the flexibility to hold issues rated BBB once they are upgraded, so there’s nothing forcing us to part ways with many of these rising stars. In light of the current economic environment, we are focused more on higher quality companies that have the potential to weather a longer, more pronounced recession, and there are more of these than ever in the high-yield market.

4.   Finding value across a spectrum of industries
Telecommunications has been a large part of the high-yield universe for many years. Another historically large segment, consumer discretionary credits such as lodging, gaming and cruise lines, saw their valuations recover with the reopening of the economy following the pandemic. We remain selective in these sectors given the uncertain economic outlook and the leverage that issuers in these sectors took on while they were shut down during the pandemic.
We see value in certain subsectors that represent a smaller part of the high-yield market, such as asset managers and insurance brokers. Given the recurring revenue models, these types of businesses have the potential to do better than the more cyclical issuers in a soft economy or a rising rate environment. Many of these companies have had predictable cash flows, whether through management fees earned on the assets under management or via commissions earned from the sale of insurance products. 
Investment time horizons matter

5.   Energy sector fundamentals have improved
Over the past decade, the energy segment of the high-yield market grew rapidly as issuance to finance oil/gas exploration and production ballooned. But when oil prices fell, many of those companies were forced to restructure their debts and cut back on capital spending. This wave of defaults is now behind us, and the energy segment is now much smaller than it was at its peak.
Today, the energy segment is the healthiest it has been in many years. As balance sheets have improved, capex plans have been curtailed, and oil/gas prices have surged, energy has been the best-performing subsector within the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High Yield 2% Issuer Capped Index. Elevated oil/gas prices and restrained spending on exploration and production have transformed this segment from cash-burning to massively cash-generating, and management teams appear laser-focused on protecting their now-healthy balance sheets. And so, while the sector is still cyclical, we view it as less risky today and it also features a larger number of high-quality companies in which to invest. 
Bottom line
Assuming a duration of four years, given a 100-basis-point rise in interest rates, a high-yield fund would be expected to lose 4%. However, given recent yields of more than 8%, the risk of rising rates is mitigated by the high yield and coupons. Of course, additional factors could impact losses that a fund experiences.
In our view, the goal of investing in high yield is to try to manage the risks that are inherent in lower quality, lower rated companies and be appropriately compensated for the risk we take. At the same time, we are careful not to be too cautious and give up yield opportunities along the way. It is not advisable to try to time the high-yield market. We believe that investors willing to maintain a long-term perspective should consider a strategic allocation to high yield as part of an income-producing fixed income portfolio and can also be opportunistic in broader multi-sector and core plus portfolios, depending on fundamentals, valuations and investor goals.

Companies are benefiting from consumer demand, but expect a more volatile environment for credit
Damien McCann, fixed income portfolio manager
The Fed seems intent on trying to slow economic activity. Rate hikes tend to impact economic activity with a lag of at least two quarters. Right now, corporate fundamentals are fairly strong, and companies are benefiting from a consumer that is able to withstand price increases. I am seeing early indications that lower income consumers are spending less, but overall, there is no significant pullback.
Inflation is a major concern, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has only added fuel to the fire. The economic toll of the invasion has far-reaching effects that are not yet fully visible. Obviously there has been an impact on the energy and grain sectors, but it has also spilled into certain parts of auto manufacturing and industrial gasses the semiconductor industry relies on.
Food and autos are more exposed to higher input costs and shortages compared to telecom and cable, or health care companies.
Spreads have widened over the past year, and it is a more volatile environment for credit. The issuance of high-yield bonds has dropped dramatically as companies wait for things to settle down.
As an active manager, I have the flexibility to react to these ongoing shifts.
The returns across investment grade, high yield, emerging markets and securitized debt are not the same over time. Being flexible and adjusting your portfolio can help buffer some of the current headwinds. There have been more opportunities in investment-grade bonds over the past few months, but I still think high-yield bonds offer better value.
Within investment-grade corporates, certain California-based utilities seem attractive. In high yield, energy companies have some upside. In my view, oil prices will stay fairly high as supply is likely to remain tight. Beyond Russia, U.S. energy companies have a labor shortage problem which will limit increases in drilling activity. People in West Texas can work remotely and earn the same wage as if they were working on an oil rig.
Among high-yield credits, I also see value in insurance brokerage and financial advisory issuers. These are resilient business models that can withstand high leverage.
Valuations and fundamentals suggest cautious optimism for emerging markets
Kirstie Spence, fixed income portfolio manager
What’s happening in Ukraine is heartbreaking. I’ve dealt with many crises in my 25-plus years of investing in emerging markets, and this one is uncharted territory on so many levels.
I think it’s prudent to stay cautious given the heightened volatility from war, inflation and the slowdown in China. However, there are idiosyncratic opportunities in emerging markets debt that an active manager can pursue.
Bonds across many emerging markets have traded lower, but some of that trading has been related to risks tied to inflation and what central banks are doing. The asset class has matured significantly over the past decade. I think valuations generally reflect some downside risks.
Overall, fundamentals are fairly decent. Several emerging markets banks have raised rates dramatically to combat inflation. And in some markets like Brazil, investors are being fairly compensated for elevated inflation. I also think certain currencies may even be cheap by historical standards.
There are bright spots. Commodity exporters such as certain Latin American-based countries have traded higher, as surging prices could help them withstand a slowdown in global growth.

Securitized assets may be more resilient compared to other bond sectors as inflation and rates rise
Xavier Goss, fixed income portfolio manager
Securitized assets cover a wide gamut of sectors such as residential mortgages, auto loans, commercial real estate and student loans. Broadly speaking, asset-backed securities and commercial mortgaged-back securities have some upside even with higher inflation. Select areas appear attractive compared to corporate credit, particularly at current spread levels.
I remain a bit cautious as tighter monetary policy will slow growth and loan demand. That will flow through and impact consumer spending. I expect an uptick in delinquencies and defaults as eviction moratoriums and other pandemic-era programs roll off. While the increase could be higher than pre-pandemic levels, it shouldn’t be exceptionally so because consumers are in a better financial position today as compared to past financial crises.
Consumers may be better prepared to weather an economic slowdown

I have been spending more time meeting with loan originators to better understand their specific underwriting standards. As financial conditions tighten, there may be a bifurcation in deal performance as weaker originators loosen their underwriting standards to maintain current loan volume.
In the current environment, I foresee more bespoke and privately negotiated transactions across the securitized space, particularly as security selection becomes a more prominent driver of returns. This is especially relevant in the consumer asset-backed securities market where there are more niche issuers.

145,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/can-tips-help-portfolio-high-inflation.html,Can TIPS help your portfolio amid high inflation?,Inflation,"February 9, 2022","If you filled up your gas tank recently, you probably weren’t thrilled with the bill. Prices are up — and not just at the pump. Across many goods and services, they are rising at the fastest pace in decades. While this increases the cost of living, it also has investment implications.
How do you shield a portfolio from rising inflation? There’s no silver bullet, but depending on your investment goals, a few strategies might help.
Key inflation question: How high for how long?
Supply shortages and other pandemic-related factors first triggered the rise of inflation. Demand for many goods began to outpace supply, which boosted prices. Towards the end of 2021, however, the trend began to look less temporary and more lasting. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a favored broad level of inflation by many economists, increased to 7% by year-end, the highest in nearly 40 years.
The Federal Reserve has taken notice. It is moving to tighten monetary policy much more aggressively than markets expected a year ago. We should see the first interest rate hike as soon as March. And, while the most recent hiking cycle saw quarterly rate moves of a quarter of a percentage point per hike, this cycle could be more rapid given the current inflation dynamics.
“High inflation is likely to persist,” says Ritchie Tuazon, portfolio manager with American Funds Strategic Bond Fund℠. “Our interest rates team estimates that inflation will continue to be firm in 2022, with our forecast a little above market consensus. In coming quarters, we project inflation well above the Fed’s 2% target.”
“The inflationary impulses we’re seeing today are strong and signal that inflation will remain elevated for some time,” says Tim Ng, a portfolio manager with American Funds Inflation Linked Bond Fund®. “Businesses are indicating rising input costs, low inventories and a backlog of orders. Supply chain bottlenecks remain. Labor markets are tight, employers are having difficulty finding workers and wages are rising. All these factors are contributing to the strongest inflationary dynamics in over 20 years.”

TIPS provide direct inflation protection
Many of today’s investors have never had to worry about high inflation. Protecting against rising prices can be important: Inflation erodes purchasing power over time. However, several assets have some indirect inflation hedging potential built in. Some stocks may benefit from rising prices as companies may see their nominal earnings rise with inflation. Many commodities are an input into production and a source of rising prices. So, having some commodity exposures in a portfolio may help hedge against rising prices. Gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset during inflationary periods.
CPI is not directly linked to any of these. Consequently, these assets can only do an imperfect job of hedging broad-based purchasing power erosion. For example, if you pick the wrong stocks and inflation affects those companies’ labor costs more than is compensated for by their rising prices, those shares could decline. If you pick the wrong commodities, they could see less value appreciation than others driving the broader trend. Gold, too, is influenced by a variety of factors and market forces that don’t always correlate directly to actual inflation.
You've discovered one of Capital Group's 10 investment themes for 2022
See the rest
A Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) is a U.S. Treasury bond that pays additional compensation when inflation rises, linked to CPI. Due to that link, it is arguably the most direct hedge to the sort of broad inflation of goods and services that affect a consumer’s purchasing power.
Are TIPS a slam dunk?
Given that direct link, should every investor pile into TIPS right now? Unfortunately, nothing in investing is quite so simple. Every asset is influenced by a set of risks, and TIPS are no exception.
“At the end of the day, TIPS are bonds and therefore have interest rate risk,” Ng says. “And as most investors have seen, yields have risen recently. So, while inflation has remained elevated, the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury-Inflation Protected Securities Index (TIPS Index) had a negative return in January due to the broad rise in bond yields.”
However, one tough month does not make an investment a poor choice in every month. To help manage the complexities of buying individual TIPS, investors can consider an actively managed inflation-linked bond fund that seeks to outpace its benchmark index. In contrast, passive index funds seek to replicate, not beat, their benchmarks. 
“We can target certain maturities within the TIPS Index that may benefit the most from near-term inflationary dynamics and are less exposed to a general rise in interest rates,” Ng explains.
Conviction about how investors are thinking about inflation also plays a part. “TIPS market values are based more on expectations than actual inflation,” Ng adds. “That means if the market decides it was wrong about the severity of inflation, prices could fall. The flip side, of course, is that as expectations rise so do TIPS values. Breakeven rates capture these expectations. These are rates of inflation that the market expects over a given period.”
TIPS breakeven rates have risen notably since 2020
Source: Bloomberg. As of 1/31/22. TIPS are Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities.
“We will be watching TIPS values closely over the next several months as the Fed’s tightening ramps up,” Ng says. “In particular, if the Fed begins reducing its balance sheet growth, it could have a negative impact on these bonds. Fed purchases are responsible for roughly 20% of TIPS demand.”
Owning a TIPS fund as a longer term strategy for preserving purchasing power might be a reasonable choice for some investors. Consider even a medium-term time horizon: The TIPS Index has only seen one period of modest negative three-year annualized returns since the inception of TIPS in 1997.
TIPS have notched positive returns over most three-year periods
Source: Morningstar. Monthly rolling returns shown for the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities Index between 2/29/2000 and 12/31/21 (from when TIPS were first created in 1997).
A TIPS fund may also be worth considering prior to retirement. At this point in a person’s investing cycle, purchasing power becomes extremely relevant as investors nearing or entering the distribution phase begin relying on their investments to contribute to income.
Core and core-plus bond funds are another option
But what if an investor is neither nearing retirement nor feels the need for a long-term TIPS exposure, but still worries about inflation’s impact on their portfolio? Some actively managed core and core-plus bond funds — the sort that aim to provide ballast to a diversified portfolio — seek to provide some exposure to TIPS as well.
The core benchmark, the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index, does not contain these inflation-protected securities. So, passive index funds seeking to replicate the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index do not own TIPS either. When active fund managers maintain exposure to TIPS, they are taking a view on inflation expectations indicated by breakeven rates. TIPS have the potential to be additive to fund results relative to the benchmark if they outpace that core index — even if the TIPS Index return is negative.
TIPS can be a useful tool for core fund managers. “For starters, we can purchase TIPS in a broader context,” Tuazon explains. “For example, TIPS can sometimes incur losses when yields are rising due to their interest rate exposure. If we have conviction that inflation will rise along with rates a hedge could be put in place to seek to mitigate that interest rate risk while still benefiting from the inflation protection.”
Like in a TIPS fund, actively managed core and core-plus funds can invest in specific inflation-linked bonds where research suggests more upside potential. As managers see inflation receding, exposure to TIPS can be reduced. This prevents the need for individual investors to attempt to time markets by getting in or out of direct investments in TIPS.
Inflation is likely to stick around for a while until central bankers get it under control. But investors have tools that can seek to limit its negative impact on their portfolios.

It’s a myth that Fed hikes are always bad news for munis
Treasury yields are a major influence on muni returns
Relative value varies widely with muni bond maturity
Not so long ago, the key question was: will they, or won’t they? Now, when it comes to the U.S. Federal Reserve and rate hikes, investors are simply wondering how high rates could go and for how long?
Interest rate hikes are taking center stage. For municipal bond investors, this is happening at a time when two other potential developments are already under the spotlight: higher income taxes and massive infrastructure spending.
Tax changes and federal spending — on bridges and roads, among other things — should act as tailwinds to munis. The asset class’s tax exemptions could become even more valued, while hundreds of billions of dollars of new capital should bolster fundamentals.
But what about higher rates — tailwind or headwind? Answer is: It’s complicated. You might assume Fed hikes will inevitably have a negative impact. After all, the values of bonds fall when yields climb — as they often have around Fed hikes.
While bond math doesn’t lie, it’s not the whole story. Here are three facts that could change your thinking about municipal bonds and rising rates.
1. Fed hikes aren’t necessarily bad news for munis
With Fed hikes now front and center, it’s little wonder bond math (when yields rise, bond values decline) has spooked some investors.
So, if you’re feeling that now’s not the time to own muni bonds, history may offer a valuable insight. The last four times rates were raised demonstrate it’s possible for municipal bonds to show limited downside — or even gains — when the Fed hikes.
Gains, as well as modest declines: Municipal bonds and past Fed hikes
Source: Bloomberg Index Services Ltd. Daily returns unavailable prior to 2006; results prior to 2006 were calculated using nearest month-ends to the first and final hikes. High-yield muni results unavailable pre-2003.
2. Treasury yields are a major influence on muni returns
Surging inflation and debate over the Fed’s likely policy response can dominate the headlines and, on occasion, unsettle markets. Volatility among U.S. Treasuries will likely continue to spill over into municipals.
Although this dynamic is nothing new, it may have more of a profound impact on muni returns than in the past. To understand why, recall that, in simple terms, muni bond returns result from two components.
First, there’s the change in yield for Treasuries (assumed to be non-risky and, therefore, provide a baseline pricing for munis and other bond markets). The other component results from changes in the credit spread, which is the “extra” yield muni investors are paid over and above Treasuries; it reflects the non-zero risk of default for any bond issuer that isn’t Uncle Sam.
The reason Treasury yield moves may hold greater sway over municipal bond valuations in coming months is that spreads are near their multiyear lows and look poised to remain there. There’s limited scope for further declines, and a significant move higher appears unlikely. Massive pandemic-era fiscal support for states and local municipalities should help keep a lid on spreads for some time, reflecting healthy balance sheets and fundamentals.
So far in 2021, Treasury yield curve changes have been a drag on overall positive muni market returns.
Munis have eked out a modest gain lately, though higher Treasury yields took a toll

3. Relative value varies widely with muni bond maturity
Relative value across the muni bond curve ebbs and flows. Lately, ratios — which express pretax AAA-rated municipal bond yields as a percentage of Treasury yields — have declined among shorter maturities. In comparison, intermediate and longer maturities have stayed relatively stable. 
This notable move in relative value seems to have resulted from investors favoring the front-end of the curve, ahead of Fed rate hikes. Compared to issues with longer maturities, the values of short-term bonds tend to be more resilient as the prevailing level of interest rates climbs (in other words, they have a lower duration).
Front-end ratios have dropped as investors prepare for Fed hikes
Source: Bloomberg Index Services Ltd. Data as of 11/30/21.
Ratios are a simple indicator of relative value. A level above 100 indicates municipal bonds are offering a yield premium, even without accounting for potential tax advantages.
In recent times, a ratio in the mid-60s and higher would suggest the tax benefits of munis could be especially attractive to an investor in the highest marginal federal income tax bracket (37%).
Over time, the specific muni maturities that have offered the highest and lowest returns has varied, further underscoring the potential benefits of taking a selective approach to investing.
Putting an emphasis on certain maturities could add value
Source: Bloomberg Index Services, Ltd. Returns shown for the Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index, and the maturity buckets that notched the maximum and minimum returns; 2021 (YTD) is through 9/30/21.
Volatility is inevitable. Here’s how to be prepared
If recent history is a guide, Fed hikes won’t be the disaster for market returns that the bond bears claim.
That said, with markets pricing in rapid and aggressive Fed policy action, volatility could remain elevated. A defensive posture in regard to interest rates — possibly including an emphasis on municipal bonds of shorter maturity — seems prudent.
More broadly, the way that muni bond yields vary with maturity (that is, the shape of the muni curve) could also present opportunities for selective investors.
As yields for different maturities move up and down, the slope of certain segments of the curve shifts. Lately, longer term yields have risen relatively rapidly amid robust economic recovery and supportive monetary and fiscal policies.
The municipal bond curve has, historically, been steeper than its Treasury counterpart due to key differences in the buyer bases for the two markets. Crucially, future tax policy is more uncertain over longer periods. Longer maturity muni bonds have, therefore, often included a yield premium to reflect that uncertainty.
Intense investor demand at a time of more moderate issuance has resulted in the muni curve becoming less steep over the past year, though it has re-steepened more recently. In general, a steeper curve can be attractive to bond investors as it means that, with the passage of time, they should earn return from capital appreciation as well as a bond’s coupon.
Curve changes are another way that active investors can seek relative value
Source: Bloomberg Index Services, Ltd. Differential between the 2s10s curve (slope of segment between 2- and 10-year maturities) for the Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index and the U.S. Treasury yield curve, through 9/30/2021.
Looking forward, moderating long-term growth prospects could result in a flatter curve as muni yields at shorter maturities climb more swiftly. If, on the other hand, the Fed is able to normalize policy while inflation subsides, the curve could steepen as the growth outlook brightens.
Cast in this light, preparing for volatility doesn’t have to mean being uninvested. A changing rates environment may actually present opportunities for those investors with the research and execution capabilities to invest nimbly. For active muni investors, market setbacks can even have a silver lining: the opportunity to invest in bonds offering higher tax-exempt yields.

Monetary Policy
The market indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
Methodology for calculation of tax-equivalent yield:
Based on 2021 federal tax rates. Taxable equivalent rate assumptions are based on a federal marginal tax rate of 37%, the top 2021 rate. In addition, we have applied the 3.8% Medicare tax. Thus taxpayers in the highest tax bracket will face a combined 40.8% marginal tax rate on their investment income. The federal rates do not include an adjustment for the loss of personal exemptions and the phase-out of itemized deductions that are applicable to certain taxable income levels.

147,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/fed-reserve-tapering.html,The long unwinding road: Our take on Fed tapering and inflation,Monetary Policy,"September 23, 2021","In the final months of this year, we expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to begin scaling back some of the extraordinary stimulus measures launched last year in the early stages of the pandemic. Although the Fed chose not to break any news about its first move at the September 2021 meeting, we already know the initial step. The central bank will begin by reducing, or tapering, the pace of its bond buying.
The last time the Fed tapered, it prompted the infamous Taper Tantrum of 2013. Markets were caught off guard and bond yields soared. With investors better prepared for tightening this time around, we don’t expect another tantrum. The Fed’s unwind has been well telegraphed with only the precise timing unknown. Let’s unpack that path and consider how it might affect fixed income markets.
Fed tapering soon but no hikes likely before late 2022
As recently as August, some investors believed that the Fed could announce the start of its taper program at its September meeting. The relatively weak jobs report paired with a softer inflation rate reading in August closed the door on that possibility, however. We now believe the Fed will announce its intention to taper as soon as its November meeting, unless economic conditions deteriorate significantly before then.
The U.S. central bank will probably begin tapering assets in the weeks following that announcement. Once that begins, based on the Fed’s previous statements and its prior tapering program, we expect it to last roughly six to nine months, most likely ending sometime around the middle of 2022. Currently the Fed is buying $120 billion of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage bonds each month. That amount will decrease gradually until the Fed is no longer adding any securities to increase the size of its balance sheet.
Once the taper has ended, the Fed will only buy assets sufficient to maintain the size of its balance sheet, replacing old securities that mature. At that time, the central bank will consider a three-part test prior to raising interest rates:
Has the economy achieved maximum employment?
Has core inflation — the rate that excludes food and energy prices — reached its 2% target?
Is core inflation on track to exceed its 2% target?
We’ll dig into these conditions next. We believe the Fed isn’t likely to begin considering hiking rates until late 2022 at the earliest. Once it does allow short-term interest rates to drift higher, we expect it to do so in a very gradual manner, as it did from 2015 through 2018.
The Fed’s expected unwinding path: Sequential and gradual
Sources: Capital Group, Bloomberg, Federal Reserve. As of 9/22/2021.
Why the Fed hasn’t hit the brakes, despite rising inflation rate
As most investors are aware, the inflation rate is not holding the Fed back. This year it has risen above the Fed’s 2% target. Consider the Fed’s favored measure, the U.S. Core Personal Consumer Expenditures Price Index. Its July reading was 3.6%. That puts it well above target — at a level not seen since the early 1990s.
Core inflation is the highest in three decades
Source: Bloomberg. As of 7/31/2021. Core inflation excludes food and energy prices.
But today’s inflation rate is not necessarily what matters when it comes to interest rate hikes. The Fed probably won’t begin considering that move until late next year. We’ll have to wait to see if the current high inflation rate is durable enough to last until then. If price growth recedes below its target, the Fed may have to wait longer.
On the other hand, inflation pressures could begin to look more severe. For example, we could see higher prices begin to bubble in areas like rent, housing and services. If the Fed begins to worry more about inflation running too hot, it may feel compelled to respond sooner.
The Fed is unlikely to signal interest rate hikes until there is a clearer employment outlook
Full employment is tougher to measure. Right now, we’re seeing some real dislocations in the labor market. Payroll surveys show the U.S. had 5 million fewer people working this summer than it did in early 2020. And that doesn’t even account for the expected natural growth of 200,000 new workers each month. That widens the gap to at least 8 million fewer workers than full employment would imply.
But looking at wages and job openings complicates this picture. Lower wage workers have seen income gains exceeding 3% this year — well above average. We are also seeing 1.3 job openings for each unemployed worker. These factors would normally indicate a very strong labor market. Current trends paint a murky picture, however. For example, the labor market could look less healthy next year than those job openings and wage increases indicate, delaying the Fed’s first interest rate hike if the unemployment rate needs more time to heal.
Mixed signals: High job openings, low employment
Source: Bloomberg. As of 8/31/2021.
Why we don’t expect Taper Tantrum 2.0
Fixed income investors panicked when the Fed announced its last taper. We don’t expect that this time. First, investors have seen the Fed take such action before. They saw its impact and that broader normalization was far from catastrophic. Back in 2013, investors feared the Fed would eventually increase the federal funds rate from zero to a range of 4% to 5% over time. That didn’t happen. This time they’re not expecting the Fed to hike interest rates much above 2%.

WATCH
Second, the market should not be caught by surprise once the process begins. The Fed has been very transparent with its plans. In numerous speeches and other communication, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and other governors have explained what to expect. As a result, the market isn’t likely to react as dramatically. Of course tighter financial conditions — through reduced liquidity and higher borrowing costs — will still have some negative impact on investors’ appetite for risk.
The Fed’s clarity has led current bond yields to already reflect the assumption of a taper announcement before the end of the year. After that happens, investors’ concerns will likely shift to how quickly the Fed reduces its asset purchases and when it will start hiking interest rates. If inflationary pressures persist and the labor market trends in the positive direction, we could begin to see Treasury yields rise across the maturity spectrum.
When the Fed begins raising short-term interest rates, shorter term yields may feel a more direct impact, prompting the yield curve to flatten. Historically, this is how we have seen it play out.
While yields throughout the market should rise over time as the Fed normalizes, the past 12 months have shown just how stubborn low yields can be. Concern about the longevity of robust economic growth has been one factor. Investors began to understand the persistence of COVID-19 when Delta and other strains caused new infection surges. The Chinese economy, a source of global economic strength over the past decade, has also been slowing. Lastly, investors believe the Fed’s inflation narrative — that the high rate we’re seeing is just transitory.
Some investors may fret or become nervous about the Fed pulling back. Yet, policymakers will only do so when they’re confident the economy can sustain it. Ultimately, normalization should help ease the concerns about inflation that have cast a long shadow over markets this year. Importantly, once the Fed has trimmed its balance sheet and, eventually, raised interest rates, it will be in a much stronger position to act when the next major economic challenge begins. Looking at the taper through the lens of a Fed that wants to maintain price stability should reassure investors: Core fixed income funds should continue to provide ballast in diversified portfolios.

The rally in high-yield municipal bonds has been a bright spot in fixed income
Valuations are stretched, though yields still compare favorably with other bond markets
Current pricing in this underresearched market underscores the need for selective investing
With their historically low correlation to equities, high-yield municipals can occupy a sweet spot in portfolio construction
High-yield municipal bonds have been on a tear. For many investors seeking higher income and total returns, this area of the bond market has been the place to be in fixed income. As of July 31, the Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Municipal Bond Index had notched a year-to-date return of 7.4% — well above the gains recorded in most other parts of the U.S. bond market.
Following an extended rally, however, spreads have narrowed to pre-pandemic levels. Municipal fundamentals have experienced a remarkable turnaround due to the more than $1 trillion of pandemic-era fiscal stimulus. The recent increase in rating upgrades should continue as local economies recover. At the same time, investor demand has remained robust. Year-to-date muni fund inflows through July 31 totaled $57 billion — nearly 50% higher than the net inflows for all of 2020.
Amid stretched valuations, now seems like a good time for investors to reassess high-yield municipal bonds. With that in mind, here’s our take on this underresearched and underinvested asset class.
Income remains relatively attractive
From an income perspective, high-yield municipal bonds offer attractive carry (put simply, yield earned by holding the bond to maturity, minus the cost of short-term financing) relative to other segments of the fixed income market. And, on a taxable-equivalent basis, relative value remains compelling.
High-yield municipals outyield corporates on a taxable-equivalent basis

Market proxies are the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index and its components for U.S Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and investment-grade (IG) corporates (rated BBB/Baa and above), and the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index (investment-grade munis), Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate High Yield Index (high-yield corporates) and Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Municipal Bond Index (high-yield munis). Yield to worst is the lowest yield that can be realized by either calling or putting on one of the available call/put dates, or holding a bond to maturity. Calling and putting refer to features of some bonds that enable an issuer to redeem the bond early, or a bondholder to demand early repayment from the issuer. 
Investors should be prepared for more muted returns
High-yield muni spreads are more than one standard deviation tighter than their 10-year average. Because fundamentals are now on a firmer footing than they were pre-pandemic, there appears to be limited potential for further spread tightening.
When spreads have been this narrow in the past, the ensuing returns generated from tightening have tended to be muted compared to returns in periods when valuations were less expensive. The chart below illustrates this in terms of the Z-score, which shows spread levels relative to the moving average, measured in standard deviations.
Historically, returns have moderated following periods of high valuation
Source: Bloomberg Index Services Ltd. Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Municipal Bond Index month-end spreads for the period July 2011 through June 2021. Standard deviation is a statistical measure of the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean. In a typical normal distribution (bell curve), about 68% of values in the dataset can be found within one standard deviation of the mean.
In the near to medium term, credit spread changes may be less of a driver of returns — but what about interest rates? In our view, a combination of macro, policy and technical factors make the possibility of rising rates a significant downside risk. Economic recovery and higher inflation expectations are providing conditions that could help lift bond yields. And, given the predominance of retail investors, any abrupt rate increases could prompt outflows from this asset class.
Furthermore, high-yield municipal bonds are often longer in duration (about 5.5 years is typical) compared to their investment-grade counterparts. Active management of duration and curve positioning in this uncertain rates environment is, therefore, especially important.
Selective exposure is prudent given the market’s credit profile
The credit ratings profile of high-yield municipal bonds also argues for taking exposure on a selective basis. Accounting for about 14% of the total municipal bond market, high-yield issues are typically rated below BB or are unrated. There are about 98,000 below-investment-grade and unrated issues outstanding.
The issuer universe is diverse. As might be expected, there are credit-challenged borrowers. However, there are also numerous smaller borrowers with modest capital needs; arguably, many of these issuers could actually warrant an investment-grade rating — if they had been around longer.
Unrated bonds are the largest segment of this market. Crucially, these issues are not necessarily riskier than rated high-yield bonds. Rather, their lack of rating may reflect that an entity has tended to issue less frequently, or perhaps in smaller sizes. Bond-by-bond credit analysis is, therefore, crucial for shining a light on fundamentals in this underresearched corner of the muni market.
Most high-yield municipal bonds are unrated
Source: Bloomberg Index Services Ltd. As of 7/31/21. For simplicity, chart omits small percentages of unrated issues in IG; for HY, those issues rated investment grade or classified as cash and equivalents are omitted.
Sector composition is more concentrated than in the investment-grade universe. The industrial development revenue (IDR), health care and special tax sectors account for the lion’s share of high-yield municipals. Special tax bonds may be less well-known: These issues are repaid with revenues from taxes on specific goods and services, or special assessment taxes levied on property owners. Overall, these sectors are dominated by project finance bonds and land-backed deals.
Three revenue bond sectors account for 62% of high-yield municipal bonds
Source: Bloomberg. As of 6/30/21. IDR refers to the industrial development revenue bond sector.
High-yield municipal bonds can occupy a sweet spot in portfolio construction
This asset class offers yields at a relatively favorable level (especially for individuals in higher income tax brackets), but without the high correlation to equities that has so often seen high-yield corporates sell off alongside equities. That historical return profile offers food for thought in the current environment, where the stock market has touched new highs and valuations among high-yield corporates appear even more stretched than in munis.
Compared with high-yield corporate bonds, similarly rated municipals recently offered a yield advantage of nearly 150 basis points (taxable equivalent). In addition to that favorable income potential, high-yield munis can offer excellent diversification potential for equity-heavy portfolios. As of June 30, 2021, the Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Municipal Bond Index had a three-year correlation to the S&P 500 Composite Index of just 0.3.

Correlation describes how closely changes in the returns of two assets mirror each other. A value of 0.3 or below is often characterized as “low,” and suggests the two assets may have a diversifying effect when held together in a portfolio.
Now’s not the time to stretch for yield
Amid tight spreads and favorable fundamentals, some municipal bond investors may be tempted to take on more risk in exchange for higher yields. We think that reaching for yield in the current environment can leave portfolios vulnerable.
At present, investors aren’t being compensated well for moving significantly lower in credit quality, extending duration, or adding leverage to amplify returns from higher quality bonds. Taking on additional muni risks in these ways may introduce significant volatility into portfolios, especially during an outflow cycle.
One way to try to reduce volatility without sacrificing too much yield could be to moderate exposure to credit risk overall, while seeking spread opportunities among higher rated municipal credits. It may also be sensible to build liquidity now — either in cash or higher quality bonds. That way, when dislocations do arise, investors with a valuation-centric approach may be well-positioned to take advantage of more favorable entry points.

150,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/how-high-rates-go.html,"Amid an economic boom, how high can rates go?",Interest Rates,"April 14, 2021","The possibility of an economic boom this year has stoked worries about higher inflation and prompted a sharp selloff in U.S. Treasuries. We spoke with fixed income portfolio manager Pramod Atluri and U.S. economist Darrell Spence about the outlook for the economy and interest rates, and whether the market could force the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected.
What’s behind the current expectations, and how fast do you think the U.S. economy can grow in 2021?
Darrell Spence: It’s all about the stimulus. The $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, which sends more than $400 billion directly to consumers, should provide a powerful tailwind for growth. All of that money hitting the economy at once is powerful, and gross domestic product growth could be pretty spectacular. There are also unspent funds from prior relief packages, plus a vaccination timeline that currently puts the U.S. somewhere in the second half of August for achieving full vaccination of the over-16 population. As that timeline compresses, the economy should open further. Finally, the Fed has said it will view near-term inflation as transitory and remain accommodative.
I think all of this could drive a quarter or two of growth of around 10% this year. Supply chain bottlenecks and residual weakness in the labor market could be impediments to reaching that level, but high-single-digit growth is very likely in 2021.
We’re seeing many signs of economic acceleration. Look no further than the recent surge of U.S. consumer spending on pleasure boats. While some American families have saved their stimulus payments, as reflected in a savings rate close to 15%, others have essentially viewed them as a bonus. While purchases of pleasure boats is a signal of high-end spending, we’re starting to see a more broad-based increase in consumer spending as well.
High seas: U.S. consumer spending on pleasure boats soars
Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Refinitiv Datastream. As of February 28, 2021. Gray bars denote recessions as determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Given the economic outlook, the market has grown concerned about inflation. Do you share that concern?
Spence: I agree with the consensus that inflation will rise this year, but a lot of that is likely to be temporary. We’ll be lapping last year’s super-low inflation, massive stimulus will be hitting the economy, and supply chain bottlenecks may drive some upward pricing pressure. I think we could see the consumer price index in the area of 2.5%.
These things will probably play out by the end of this year, and then inflation should get back to a longer-term trend rate. I don’t expect it to stage a major breakout. But it could persist a little bit higher over the longer term, especially if there is more fiscal support in the form of a large infrastructure bill.
It’s clear that the market is already sniffing this out. That's why TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) breakeven rates, which measure inflation expectations, are elevated. But inflation would have to really take off for expectations to rise meaningfully from here. At this point, a market pricing in 2.6% inflation doesn’t seem to be worrying the Fed.

Given this backdrop, where do you see interest rates moving over the next year?
Pramod Atluri: With the 10-year Treasury yielding almost 1.75%, interest rates at the long end of the curve are back to pre-pandemic levels — a time when U.S. growth and inflation were both trending at around 2%. That was a late-cycle economy that looked tired in many respects. Today, the economic environment is vastly different. So it makes sense to me that interest rates could move higher, although the bulk of the repricing has already occurred. 
I’d say long rates could move higher by around 50 basis points, but it will be hard for them to move too high, too fast. Here’s why. First, there’s the Fed. By holding overnight interest rates close to 0% and promising to keep them there for years, the Fed is preventing the curve from moving significantly higher, particularly at the front end (less than seven years). Second, this effect is magnified by the Fed’s purchase of well over $1 trillion of securities per year. And third, there’s global interest rates. While the U.S. has a very positive growth and inflation outlook, other countries are still dealing head-on with the effects of COVID-19. With interest rates still low and even negative in many parts of the world, the U.S. should continue to attract international capital, which will weigh on U.S. rates.
How do you see the yield curve evolving?
Atluri: The yield curve has already steepened significantly, with the 10-year Treasury yield almost 125 basis points above the 2020 lows and the Fed pinning the short end near 0%. If growth and inflation reach the levels that Darrell suggests are possible, then 10- and 30-year Treasury yields may rise further, but shorter maturities will find it difficult to move higher.
At this point I’m finding value at the front end of the curve, such as the five-year maturity. At a yield of around 0.9%, it’s approaching my year-end target of 1%. The income generated from holding these bonds would significantly outweigh a move higher of 10 basis points. When you layer on the extra yield from investing in sectors such as corporate bonds and agency mortgage-backed securities, plus the benefit of falling yields as bond holdings get closer to maturity — what we call rolling down the curve — I think it is quite possible that short and intermediate fixed income securities could have positive low-single-digit total returns over the next year.

In terms of monetary policy, could a stronger-than-expected economy force the Fed’s hand?
Atluri: The Fed will adjust policy based on actual employment and inflation outcomes, not on forecasts. So the key to understanding how fast the Fed will hike rates is how quickly growth picks up. If U.S. economic growth approaches 8%-10% instead of the consensus of 5.5% for 2021, this may accelerate the Fed’s timeline. The more growth you have, the faster we're going to hit the Fed’s targets, and the market is going to start pricing it accordingly.
My base case is that the Fed will begin to hike rates in early- to mid-2023 at a pace of 25 basis points every quarter, which is the same pace as the last hiking cycle. The Fed has signaled that it will taper asset purchases ahead of any rate hikes, so that implies a Fed taper in late 2022 or early 2023 — roughly two years from now.

How do you think the labor market might affect the Fed’s decision-making?
Spence: At 6.2% in February, the unemployment rate looks a lot better than it probably is under the surface. If you're out of the labor force, you’re not counted as unemployed. But we have to assume that a good chunk of those people would normally be employed — they dropped out because they had to care for kids who were at home, or for other reasons. So the true unemployment rate may be around 8%-8.5%. Overall, I think we’re around 6 million jobs below where we were before the pandemic. There's still a lot of lingering damage.
Now, it could go in the other direction quickly, but we need to see a broader and more sustained reopening, particularly in schools and things like that. In my view the jobs market is healing, but there’s a long way to go. Meanwhile, the Fed wants to see sustained improvement in the labor market and broad-based participation in the economy. All of this just makes me think it’s going to be slower to tighten. 
What does all of this mean for bond investors?
Atluri: In an environment where longer rates rise by 50 basis points while the five-year Treasury yield remains around 1%, one might expect that a passive index bond fund could have a negative total return of –1% to –2% over the next year. However, active managers can do better than this.
For example, by focusing investments at the front end of the curve while avoiding or underweighting the long end, active managers with a duration of six years may be in position to maximize their gains and minimize their losses, leading to potentially better total returns. In fact, investors who are nervous about higher rates can do this themselves by shifting their fixed income allocation into short and intermediate bond funds that have a majority of their assets in the part of the curve that has already repriced and may be poised for positive total returns in 2021.
The flipside to higher rates is that they improve the ability of bond funds to diversify equity risk and provide downside protection in the event of another market correction. Even though asset valuations are high, there are many indications that markets are more fragile beneath the surface. It certainly seems plausible that the extreme liquidity provided by central banks has fueled massive speculation. If so, then investors need to be very careful to not overextend, which is why maintaining a high-quality fixed income allocation is as relevant today as it was in 2020. In the event of another significant shock that threatens the recovery, we could easily see interest rates fall significantly, which would push bond prices higher. In this situation, the fixed income allocation can provide ballast, capital preservation and liquidity to help cushion portfolios, just like it did during the COVID-19 shock of 2020.

151,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/4-reasons-no-fear-rising-interest-rates.html,Four reasons not to fear rising interest rates,Interest Rates,"March 24, 2021","After a stellar 2020, the bond market is coming under pressure. Massive government stimulus measures and an improving economic outlook are combining to stoke one of fixed income investors’ biggest fears: higher inflation.
The selloff has been sharp. After rising more than 7% last year, the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index is down more than 3% on a year-to-date basis. The key questions for investors: Is the selloff warranted, and are rates likely to continue rising significantly from here? Our answer to both is no.
Long-term yields have risen but remain historically low
Source: Bloomberg. As of 3/19/21.
1. The market is overreacting
We believe the market is getting carried away with rate hike anxiety. Market expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike in 2022 are earlier than we anticipate.
Our view is based on the Fed’s desire to get the U.S. back to full employment. On evaluating the labor market, the Fed has articulated a broad approach. That means no single employment measure will work as a rate hike trigger. Fed officials will consider a variety of measures of underemployment, labor participation and even employment trends within specific demographic and income groups. Some of those, such as a weak labor participation rate, suggest labor market slack and possibly some longer term scarring. This should lead to patience on the part of U.S. central bankers when considering when to tighten policy.
Additionally, the Fed has indicated that it is comfortable allowing inflation to run “hot” — above its 2% target — for a period of time if monetary policy is helping to hasten job creation amid elevated unemployment. This is evident by embracing policies such as average inflation targeting. This policy targets an average inflation rate over a period rather than having a rigid ceiling for all periods.
For these reasons, we believe that the Fed will remain broadly accommodative. It appears likely to encourage strengthening economic activity until late 2023 or even early 2024. Fed Chair Jerome Powell seems committed to projecting any action that could tighten policy well in advance of implementation. We believe the Fed will follow a structured unwinding path. This strategy is likely to be similar to its 2013–2015 signaling that led to its first hike after the financial crisis.
How will the first rate hike unfold?
Source: Capital Group, Federal Reserve. As of 3/22/21. Fed dots represent the median Federal Open Market Committee projections when rate increases will occur. The market dots represent investor expectations based on futures pricing. The lower timeline represents how Capital Group’s interest rates team believes the unwinding path could unfold. The Fed is likely to ""taper,"" meaning to reduce its asset purchases, as an early step towards policy normalization prior to raising rates
Due in part to our view on the Fed, we find shorter term U.S. Treasuries attractive at present. If the market comes around to our view on monetary policy, these yields could decline and associated bond values rise. We are neutral on longer term Treasuries.
The combination of loose monetary policy and fiscal stimulus has led inflation expectations to rise over the past few quarters. That has helped boost values of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). However, the Fed’s tolerance for moderate inflation could lead expectations to rise further. This may occur if the central bank’s policy remains stimulative for longer than the market currently anticipates. If those expectations rise, so too will the value of TIPS.
What if we are wrong and higher rates are rapidly approaching? Even then, there are strong reasons to stay invested in high-quality bonds.
2. Rates are rising for a good reason — a strong recovery
Growth and inflation expectations have picked up, as markets are seeing light at the end of the pandemic tunnel. Vaccines are steadily rolling out, and infections are on the decline: These are harbingers of stronger growth. They also underscore that the improving U.S. labor market trend will likely continue as COVID-19 restrictions lift.
These positive factors have not prompted the Fed to signal rate hikes. However, their commitment to maintaining low rates amid more robust economic activity has helped boost inflation expectations. The Fed has pledged to endure moderate inflation to cut unemployment further. Yet the market believes rising inflation could mean higher rates are not that far off. An investor consensus projects an initial hike in 2022.
Inflation expectations are rising

3. Core taxable bonds have shown resilience amid rate hikes
Bond values decline when rates rise. But history suggests that this isn’t the whole story. When rates rise, they historically haven’t done so quickly and sharply enough to cause significant losses over a hiking cycle for core bond investors.
The yield bonds offer investors and other factors that push up bond values can help provide a positive total return. The chart below shows rate hiking periods over the past several decades. In all those periods, only two have seen negative total returns for the core bond benchmark. Despite rising rates, the average return for these periods was nearly 4%.
Rising rates don’t always mean negative bond returns
Sources: Bloomberg Index Services Ltd., Federal Reserve. Data through 3/17/2021. Periods represented above include: 4/1/83-7/31/84, 1/1/87-9/30/87, 4/1/88-5/31/89, 2/4/94-2/1/95, 6/30/99-5/16/00, 6/30/04-6/29/06, 12/16/15-12/20/18. Note: Daily results for the index are not available prior to 1994. For those earlier periods, returns were calculated from the closest month-end to the day of the first hike through the closest month-end to the day of the final hike.
Recent history is probably more relevant to what we can expect from the Fed as well. When central bankers began raising rates in 2015, they did so gradually. They began with a 25-basis point hike in December 2015. The Fed then waited a full year for another. Over the next year it raised rates three more times, again by just 25-basis points per hike.
History alone may seem a compelling enough reason not to abandon your core bond allocation when rates begin to rise. However, we would argue a core bond allocation is something a balanced portfolio needs in any market environment. Having a strong core bond allocation can help to provide a measure of stability when unexpected shocks hit. Indeed, today’s market makes an even stronger case for maintaining a solid core.
With riskier asset prices soaring, we believe investors should prioritize diversification from equities and capital preservation in fixed income. Markets are reflecting the likelihood of a post-pandemic economic upswing, but there could be bumps along the way. As the market crash in early 2020 illustrated, high-quality core fixed income can serve as ballast in portfolios during periods of equity stress.
What kind of core or core-plus funds should you consider? Those that do not take excessive credit risk. Their correlation to equities — how closely tied their returns are to those of stocks — should be relatively low. At Capital Group, we strive for this outcome with our core and core-plus funds The Bond Fund of America® and American Funds Strategic Bond Fund.℠
4. Core municipal bonds have also shown stability amid rising rates
Like taxable bonds, municipal bonds have also felt the impact of rising yields this year. While munis have become more credit driven in recent years, rates still have a major impact. Returns for the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index are down 0.75%, year-to-date through March 18. But as with taxable bonds, a longer term perspective can be revealing. Consider those same periods of Fed rate hikes as shown earlier for the core taxable index.
Munis have held up well amid periods of rising rates
Sources: Bloomberg Index Services Ltd., Federal Reserve. Data through 3/17/2021. Periods represented above include: 4/1/83-7/31/84, 1/1/87-9/30/87, 4/1/88-5/31/89, 2/28/94-2/28/95, 6/30/99-5/31/00, 6/30/04-6/29/06, 12/16/15-12/20/18. Note: Daily results for the index are not available prior to 2006. For those earlier periods, returns were calculated from the closest month-end to the day of the first hike through the closest month-end to the day of the final hike.
For the municipal bond index, the results are similar. In most periods, the return was positive or close to flat. The average over all seven periods was a positive return of more than 4%.
“Rising rates may help our strategies increase tax-exempt yields,” says Fixed Income Product Manager Neil Amirtha. “Narrowing spreads, the premium investors are paid for credit risk over risk-free assets, would help us take advantage of dislocated subsectors. Those include bonds from hospitals, senior living facilities and transportation issues such as mass transit. For these sectors, spreads have yet to fully normalize to pre-pandemic levels.”
Today’s muni market has already been recovering from the onset of the pandemic, with better-than-expected revenue collections. But it has another tailwind: recent stimulus measures from Washington. The 2020 CARES Act, the stimulus passed in December and the American Rescue Plan Act passed this year will all help. Together, they provide about $1.2 trillion in muni-related aid provisions for subsectors such as state and local governments, health care and education. This should further improve muni bond fundamentals.
At first glance, prospects for rising rates may make fixed income investing seem unattractive. And yet, from a vantage point that is both long term and recognizes the roles of fixed income in a balanced portfolio, it’s clear that rising rates are no reason to abandon bonds.

The market indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable. While not directly correlated to changes in interest rates, the values of inflation linked bonds generally fluctuate in response to changes in real interest rates and may experience greater losses than other debt securities with similar durations.

Municipal bond issuers have taken a pervasive revenue hit, though a rebound has begun and we do see some attractive value
Downgrades look set to increase, while defaults should remain rare
The pandemic and its economic fallout are reshaping opportunities for active investors
Expect greater differentiation among sectors and credits as fundamentals diverge
Commuter trains with seats to spare at rush hour. Vacant dorm rooms. And, of course, hospital wards, stretched to capacity. The effects of COVID-19 on all our lives have been plain to see. 
As municipal bond investors, however, it’s important to note that the pandemic’s impact on transportation, education and health care (among other sectors) has also been profound.
Although everyday life should return to “normal” with the rollout of vaccines, muni investors should prepare for uncharted territory. The pandemic and its economic fallout mean that 2021 will prove anything but business as usual. We anticipate that we’ll continue to see pockets of attractive value across the market, as well as weakness in certain areas.
Lost tax revenue is leaving some state and local governments with critical budget shortfalls. Likewise, a wide range of issuers in transportation, education, health care and other parts of the market have struggled with weaker revenues and higher costs.
All that almost certainly adds up to a more challenging investment environment. And yet, in today’s low-rate world, there’s a clear silver lining: improved tax-advantaged income potential.
So far, municipal valuations have not rebounded from the meltdown of March 2020 to the same degree as other global credit markets. For example, the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index is yielding more than the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index, even before adjusting for taxes. Yields already vary widely among and within municipal sectors. Looking forward, we expect to see even greater sector and credit differentiation as fundamentals diverge. 
Income potential varies widely among municipal sectors
Yields and returns among muni bonds will likely vary more widely and that’s OK. As Karl Zeile, a portfolio manager for several funds including The Tax-Exempt Bond Fund of America® and American High-Income Municipal Bond Fund® has noted: “It’s just the kind of environment where active managers like us can really prove our mettle.”
With all that in mind, here are four key themes we’re keeping an eye on in 2021:
1. Downgrades could accelerate, but widespread defaults are unlikely
Lower sales and income tax receipts are putting a sizable hole in state and local government budgets. In some states with economies that are reliant on tourism, sales and income taxes have declined by double-digit percentages. Total budget gaps across all 50 states could total several hundred billion dollars in 2021.
Rainy day funds have helped lessen the impact of lost revenues. In many states, these budget stabilization funds (as they’re formally known) could be exhausted by year-end. 
On the other hand, state and local governments can raise revenues and cut expenses to offset these fiscal challenges. Many issuers will also benefit from the economic boost that results from the new $900 billion federal stimulus package that was signed into law in late December. 
Even though the revenue hit to states hasn’t been as severe as initially feared, some investors remain concerned about the possibility of defaults and bankruptcies. It’s therefore important to note that municipal defaults and bankruptcies have been relatively rare. 
Analyses by Moody’s Investor Service (for the period 1970 through 2018) laid bare the contrasting default trends of municipals and global corporates. For example, the 10-year cumulative defaults rate for high-yield munis and corporates were 7.5% and 28.8%, respectively. For investment-grade issuers, the rates were just 0.1% and 2.3%, respectively.

WATCH NOW
States are not able to file for relief under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and filings by counties and cities have typically numbered 10 or fewer per year in the past decade. On average, the annual number of defaults across all sectors has been in the double digits, and almost all have occurred in the nonrated segment of the market. 
For context, the municipal market includes tens of thousands of issuers and hundreds of thousands of securities. Senior housing and industrial revenue bonds accounted for much of the dollar value of defaults in 2020, and none of these issuers were rated investment grade prior to the pandemic. 
Revenue bonds account for most of the municipal market. Each bond is backed by a dedicated revenue stream from a specific project — anything from a hospital to a toll road. Unlike general obligation (GO) bonds, they therefore have very little connection to state and local government finances.
For the foreseeable future, downgrades among revenue bonds will likely remain elevated compared to recent years, and may accelerate in 2021. Even so, except for the sharp rise in downgrades seen in the second quarter of 2020, the trend hasn’t been as grave as during the global financial crisis. Back then, downgrades jumped at the onset in 2008, and remained elevated for a few years. It seems prudent, therefore, to prepare for a period of greater downgrade risk.
Default history and distressed yields highlight potential trouble spots 
2. Opportunities in education, hospitals and senior living are being reshaped
High unemployment levels and some setbacks for consumer spending have meant less tax revenue going into state coffers. This, in turn, may result in reduced official expenditure on both education and health care. Here are our thoughts on some key sectors:
Higher education. Online and hybrid learning will potentially reduce income from tuition fees and state budget cuts could impact some public universities. On the expense side, teacher salaries often dominate spending and, because of the “tenure” system, can’t easily be reduced. Profit margins will likely trend lower, and balance sheets could weaken as schools are forced to free up cash to help cover operating expenses.
School districts. Most continue to collect their reimbursements from states, even if they have switched to fully remote or hybrid learning. Providing technology to students for remote learning has resulted is some increased spending, but the pandemic has so far had a fairly muted impact on fundamentals.  
Not-for-profit hospitals. Nationwide, hospitals experienced temporary revenue and volume declines due to loss of elective and non-urgent procedures. Many systems have tapped the bond market to help bolster liquidity at relatively low interest rates, while also deferring capital investments. Fundamentals heading into this downturn were generally stronger than witnessed in the Great Recession, and federal support has also provided a lifeline. Even so, this is shaping up to be a tough year for the sector. Mergers and acquisitions activity will likely reaccelerate as struggling hospitals seek out new partners.
Senior living. We’ve seen a marked divergence here. Fundamentals for well-run projects with high occupancies and sound management teams are showing resilience. On the other hand, fundamentals among weaker credits have deteriorated. Overall, this sector may bounce back strongly as pent-up demand is unleashed, once vaccinations become more widespread.
Some potential COVID winners and losers in three key muni sectors
3. The transit sector could take years to fully recover 
Transportation is another area where we see growing divergence. Toll road bonds, for example, have rallied and regained much of the ground lost earlier in 2020, while mass transit credits continue to suffer.
Greater numbers of people working from home or favoring alternate transportation has prompted a collapse in transit ridership and, therefore, fare collections. At the same time, many transit agencies are heavily subsidized through sales taxes, payroll taxes and other revenues. Many of these revenue streams have also taken a major hit.
As a result, risk is elevated across the sector, and it will likely be several years before revenue streams recover to pre-pandemic levels. Mass transit has often accounted for a greater share of lower rated issuance among transportation bonds. We’ve already seen high-profile downgrades, and volatility may rise as systems feel increased financial pressure. That being said, funding mixes do vary among mass transit systems. Furthermore, some may be deemed essential to the functioning of local and regional economies — making them potentially strong candidates for extra state or federal support.
4. Expect yields and returns to vary more widely as fundamentals diverge 
As noted in our sector-specific views, diverging fundamentals will lead to greater variation in yields and returns within the asset class. 
Pockets of value are also apparent when viewing the market through the lens of credit quality. For example, before adjusting for the tax exemption, BBB municipal yields are more than 100 basis points above comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries (and, indeed AAA-rated municipals). 
This yield gap is well above what we witnessed pre-pandemic. Amid overall normalization in municipals and other fixed income markets, this differential hasn’t narrowed back down because uncertainty still hangs over the outlook. Given ongoing questions around the short- to intermediate-term financial health of states and other municipal issuers, it’s perhaps not surprising that lower quality municipal credits are most affected.
Lower rated investment grade is a sweet spot among munis 
Final thoughts
The pandemic’s immediate impact on municipal issuers has been cushioned by massive policy responses. Federal fiscal aid provided as part of the $2.2 trillion pandemic stimulus package in March 2020 and the Federal Reserve’s Municipal Liquidity Facility were both hugely helpful. Many states, for example, managed to record less severe declines in revenues for the fiscal year ended June 2020 than they had initially feared. The new $900 billion federal stimulus package could prove similarly supportive. 
Even so, 2021 is shaping up to be quite different. Uncertainties about the precise path of economic recovery and how quickly vaccination will turn the tide on the pandemic all loom large. The Democrats’ victory in Georgia’s runoff elections on January 5 is also potentially significant. With Democrats controlling the U.S. Senate, it may be more likely that state and local aid will pass under the new administration. This development could benefit certain parts of the market such as governmental and transportation bonds. It’s likely to be a year where careful municipal bond selection, built on issuer by issuer research, will be especially important.

If agency ratings differ, the security will be considered to have received the lowest of those ratings, consistent with the fund's investment policies. Securities in the Unrated category have not been rated by a rating agency; however, the investment adviser performs its own credit analysis and assigns comparable ratings that are used for compliance with fund investment policies.

In some ways, markets have already moved on, boosted by promising news on vaccines and improving economic data around the world. Investors have found their animal spirits, helping fuel rebounds in prices for equities and other risk assets. 
Most fixed income sectors are on track to notch healthy gains for the year. But with low interest rates and relatively modest yields for credit, much of that optimism is already priced into markets. As a result, we expect more moderate returns as we look forward to 2021.
With the tailwind of ultra-low interest rates, accommodative monetary policy and the potential for additional fiscal stimulus, we believe the economy will continue to heal in 2021. And if vaccines and other medical advances prove effective, growth could continue to look better than expected. 
However, COVID-19 has had a huge impact on virtually every part of the global economy. These effects will be felt for years to come.

Travel, hospitality, energy and retail sectors have all been upended. While this has created opportunities for the strong, it has meant distress or bankruptcy for the weak. 
Looking ahead to 2021, we see a vastly different economic and market backdrop compared to the pre-COVID world. Interest rates in many parts of the globe are negative and likely to remain that way for some time. 
In the U.S., the Federal Reserve’s near-zero interest rate policy looks set to continue for years while unemployment remains elevated. Inflation had been low and stable for years, but it fell precipitously in 2020. It looks set to push higher going forward due to massive central bank stimulus, stronger economic growth and other factors. After a decade of dollar strength, surging budget deficits and reduced globalization could trigger a U.S. dollar bear market.
The new year is going to look very different. The shifting tides we see ahead create both risk and opportunity for investors. With valuations fully recovered in many parts of the market, active security selection will be critically important. Portfolio managers need to be poised to take advantage of opportunities and avoid investments that will not fully recover. 
In this challenging environment, investors should consider these four actions:
1. Do more with cash
In a world where money markets yield almost 0% and inflation is moving higher, holding excess cash is likely to destroy wealth and purchasing power. And with the Fed expected to hold rates down for two years or more, this wealth destruction will be compounded. With an accommodative Fed and an improving economic outlook, excess cash may be a significant drag on returns. 
Fixed income offers alternatives that seek to provide relative safety and liquidity, as well as yields that should better keep pace with expected inflation. Short and intermediate taxable funds offer yields near 1%, while short-intermediate muni funds can offer even greater tax-equivalent yields for investors in high tax brackets. And in an actively managed fund, investors may be able to generate even stronger total returns. 
Holding cash can be costly
While the relative safety of a bond fund is not quite as strong as cash since a negative return is possible, some can get close. Consider a short-term fund consisting of 100% investment-grade bonds and a track record of capital preservation as an alternative to pursue some investment gain. 
Two such funds in the taxable and tax-exempt buckets include Intermediate Bond Fund of America® and Limited-Term Tax-Exempt Bond Fund of America®. These funds aim to provide modest income while focusing on capital preservation and diversification from equities. Their three-year correlations to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index — a good measure of diversification if near zero or below — were –0.08 and 0.27, respectively (F-2 share class as of November 30).

2. Stay strong at the core
Coming into 2020, some bond bears argued that with most Treasury yields below 2%, fixed income offered little value and might no longer be an effective hedge for a portfolio’s equity investments. Once again, these predictions proved wrong. During the deep equity correction, the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, a typical benchmark for core bond funds, did exactly what it was supposed to do. It zigged when stocks zagged, providing both diversification and capital preservation. 
Even as equities have recovered, bonds have held up. The benchmark was up 7.4% as of November 2020. In this challenging market environment, high-quality fixed income has shined. Anyone who held a strong core fixed income allocation should be more convinced than ever of its value — and its role in a balanced portfolio. 
The core bond benchmark held steady as stocks sank
Equity indexes recently set new all-time highs in the face of a shifting and uncertain economic backdrop. The resulting equity appreciation creates an excellent opportunity for investors to consider rebalancing portfolios by adding fixed income to restore their desired allocation. This would seek to rebuild the diversification and capital preservation that proved so valuable in 2020.
Of course, not all core and core-plus bond funds are created equal. Some put too much emphasis on yield. Such funds take on the sort of credit risk that should be avoided when pursuing stability. A strong track record of diversification from equities matters. 
Consider the three-year correlations to the S&P 500 Index of The Bond Fund of America® and American Funds Strategic Bond Fund℠ (our flagship Core and Core-Plus offerings). They were 0.12 and 0.00, respectively (F-2 share class as of November 30), demonstrating strong diversification.
3. Rethink income
Credit is an area where careful security and industry selection should be front and center in 2021. Finding good value in corporate bonds now requires a much more discerning eye. The yield gap between corporate bonds and U.S. Treasuries, known as the spread, has returned to near pre-COVID levels, despite deteriorating prospects and fundamentals. 
In other words, corporates on the whole are not offering a tremendous amount of compensation for the additional risks entailed. High-yield default rates have risen and are still rising. 
In this type of environment, owning the corporate index indiscriminately at a time when it includes nearly $300 billion of BBB bonds (the lowest investment grade rating) with a negative outlook does not seem prudent. Fundamental research is more important than ever to distinguish between companies with the strongest return potential and those with weakening prospects. 
Corporate bond spreads have fallen to near pre-COVID levels
Plenty of opportunities can also provide attractive sources of income beyond investment-grade corporate credit. The coming year is likely to be one where we see significant shifts in sector leadership. A diversified multisector approach can offer particular value here by uncovering additional investment ideas and providing varied sources of potential return. 
American Funds Multi-Sector Income Fund℠  takes such an approach. Its managers pursue income by drawing from different sectors — from corporates to securitized bonds to emerging markets debt. This allows managers to pursue the best income opportunities from a broad set of options. By aiming for a 50/50 split of above/below investment grade, managers also remain mindful of risk. 
4. Look to municipal bonds for attractive tax-exempt yields
At first glance, the municipal bond market appears to have moved on from its March 2020 meltdown. Strong investor demand has helped fuel a recovery. However, municipal valuations have not rebounded to the same degree as other credit markets, and the impact of the economic downturn will likely cast a long shadow into 2021.
Tax revenue lost during the pandemic leaves some state and local governments with critical budget shortfalls. Likewise, a wide range of muni issuers in sectors such as transportation, higher education, health care and various tax-backed parts of the market have struggled with weaker revenues and higher costs.
We expect to see even greater credit differentiation among muni bonds as fundamentals diverge in the months ahead. Given the likely headwinds, a selective investment approach is crucial. Bottom-up research is an essential aspect of assessing the trade-off between risk and return potential.
This challenging outlook does have a silver lining in today’s low-rate world: improved income potential. Lately, the taxable-equivalent yields offered by municipals have surpassed those of taxable bonds. They are especially attractive for investors in the highest tax brackets. 
Some sectors, such as toll roads, have regained much of the ground lost earlier in 2020. However, there are pockets of potential value in other sectors, such as education and health care, across the credit quality spectrum. BBB municipal yields are more than 150 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasuries before the tax exemption — a yield gap well above pre-pandemic levels.
Lower rated investment grade is a sweet spot among munis
Actively managed funds such as The Tax-Exempt Bond Fund of America® have the flexibility to emphasize bonds where research indicates an attractive trade-off between risk and return potential. And don’t forget, this is an asset class that has often provided excellent diversification. As of November 30, 2020, this fund’s F-2 share class had a three-year correlation to the S&P 500 of 0.17%.
Higher yields offered by certain bonds appear to compensate investors for the risks entailed. This is especially true if you factor in the possibility of further federal support for states and local government issuers materializing in 2021. But even without federal aid, some pockets of value in municipals will reward investors over the long term.
Looking ahead, it seems likely that the world will soon start to overcome this terrible pandemic. Even so, it seems prudent to prepare for bumps along the road to recovery. In our view, the four actions outlined can help smooth the ride for your portfolio, no matter what comes next.

The market indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable. The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds.
Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness. If agency ratings differ, the security will be considered to have received the lowest of those ratings, consistent with the fund's investment policies. Securities in the Unrated category have not been rated by a rating agency; however, the investment adviser performs its own credit analysis and assigns comparable ratings that are used for compliance with fund investment policies.
Methodology for calculation of tax-equivalent yield: 
Based on 2020 federal tax rates. Taxable equivalent rate assumptions are based on a federal marginal tax rate of 37%, the top 2020 rate. In addition, we have applied the 3.8% Medicare tax. Thus taxpayers in the highest tax bracket will face a combined 40.8% marginal tax rate on their investment income. The federal rates do not include an adjustment for the loss of personal exemptions and the phase-out of itemized deductions that are applicable to certain taxable income levels.

154,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/corporate-defaults-triple.html,Corporate defaults have tripled: What you need to know,Bonds,"August 19, 2020","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Corporate defaults have jumped, but the default rate has been low for a very long time
The market for lower rated companies is much less efficient, so there’s more opportunity to differentiate and find value
Especially over the long term, returns on high-yield bonds (BB/Ba and lower) can provide investors who are willing to take a little higher risk of loss a significant income boost
Hertz, Neiman Marcus and Cirque du Soleil are just a few of the household names that have recently filed for bankruptcy amid pandemic-induced lockdowns. With more bankruptcies on the way and sharply rising default rates, are high-yield investments worth the risk to your portfolio?
The good news is that decisive action by the Federal Reserve — including a corporate bond-buying program — has reduced the potential for a severe market selloff such as the one experienced in March. And while no one can predict the future, high-yield bonds have held up well in the aftermath of previous recessions.
In the following Q&A, fixed income portfolio manager Shannon Ward shares her thoughts on the wave of bankruptcies and its impact on the high-yield bond market:
We’ve seen defaults in the U.S. triple from last year to a rate of 6.2%. What’s your expectation for the rest of the year?
The default rate has been very low for a very long time. The normal default cycle is around 3% per year, and it’s stayed below that level for multiple years. We are now seeing an upswing. I expect default rates to continue rising until next year. I wouldn’t be surprised if they hit the high single digits. As an active high-yield bond manager, that’s a big deal. I am trying to price and avoid defaults.
With COVID-19 shutdowns hitting businesses hard, companies have had to take on new debt, borrow on their revolving credit facilities and/or take advantage of government relief programs. But the longer the pandemic lasts, the more likely they will exhaust these pools of liquidity and be forced to negotiate a deal with their lenders or file for bankruptcy.
What industries are most vulnerable?
Not surprisingly, companies forced to cut back drastically because of the lockdowns make up a sizable portion of the defaults and bankruptcies we have seen so far. Think retailers such as GNC and J. C. Penney. Energy companies dealing with persistently low oil prices such as Chesapeake Energy are also examples.
These companies and industries have been on our watch list for some time as they were struggling pre-pandemic. Brick-and-mortar retail companies have been dealing with the massive shift toward e-commerce. In energy, there was considerable excitement around shale and fracking, and investors threw a lot of capital at these companies when oil prices were higher. But now that exuberance is coming home to roost.
It’s rarely just one thing. Defaults typically don’t happen with only one catalyst, it’s usually a number of things that push companies over the edge, and it depends on leverage. Many of the companies that defaulted recently took on a lot of debt over the past few years, so their defaults have been years in the making.
In a knock-on effect, commercial real estate companies that own malls may also face some distress since they depend on rent payments from retailers to service their own debts. Smaller stores that count on mall traffic and don’t have a robust online presence have and will continue to experience headwinds as large anchor stores depart.
High-yield investments are so company specific. Can you provide an example of a company whose high-yield bonds did well?
Sprint is a case in point. Some industry participants viewed the company as the weakest of the four U.S. wireless providers, and their over-levered balance sheet made it hard for them to invest in improving the network. Others thought that the company and its spectrum had strategic value, and that the bonds were trading at too big a discount.
When investment-grade-rated (BBB/Baa and higher) T-Mobile agreed to purchase the company, and when they finally received regulatory approval for the merger to go through, their bonds soared in value. This took years to play out, and there were a lot of twists and turns along the way.
Can you cite an example of an investment that proved to be a disappointment?
As I mentioned earlier, regulatory approval for acquisitions can really move bond prices. In this case, I owned the bonds of a printing company that had agreed to merge with a higher quality competitor. The merger was widely expected to get regulatory approval, but it was unexpectedly deemed to be anti-competitive and so the transaction fell through.
The company’s performance suffered during the protracted period of uncertainty while the merger was under review by the government, and when the acquisition was called off the bonds dropped.
What happens to high-yield bond investors when a company files for bankruptcy protection?
The bankruptcy process gives companies time to deal with their debts and prevents lenders from taking action without court approval. Many are pre-arranged so that by the time the company files for bankruptcy, a plan of reorganization has been agreed to by creditors. The time leading up to the actual filing is when we as investors make decisions about what we want to do with the investment.
By the time they are in bankruptcy, we’ve generally already decided if this is a company that we want to stick with through the restructuring. We also are constantly reassessing our investment thesis as new information or events happen.
We can and have made investments such as debtor-in-possession financing to help companies through the bankruptcy process. We also own post-reorganization equity, or stock that we received as a form of payment as part of the court process. It’s not something we do regularly of course, but it’s one way to preserve capital.
Where are you finding opportunities in the high-yield market?
During the worst of the market collapse in March and April, there were a lot of opportunities in the higher rated high-yield issuers and so-called “fallen angels” (companies downgraded to high yield from investment grade). But most of these higher quality bonds have recovered to pre-crisis levels. The BB-rated market has grown to about 55% of the high-yield market as of July 31, 2020, so we are making investments there, particularly with new high-yield issuance up 48% compared to last year.
I’m also finding more opportunities lower in the high-yield ratings spectrum. Many of these companies should be able to manage through the pandemic but a lot of investors just don’t have the time, expertise, or mandate flexibility to invest in this area. Given the smaller base of investors, the market for lower rated companies is much less efficient, so there’s more opportunity to differentiate and find values.
But you must be careful because some of these companies may not fully recover. This is where our company-by-company and security-by-security approach to investing can shine.
Did the Fed’s program to buy corporate debt help high-yield companies?
The Fed has been there to solve the systemic issues. They don’t want Treasury markets to seize up, mortgages to crash and large investment-grade companies to be unable to repay their debt. The bond-buying programs worked to reopen markets in April and helped many companies raise the cash they needed to weather the downturn. They also gave other lenders the confidence to lend, so the actual quantum of debt purchased by the Fed has been limited.
The Fed also has special programs for industries most impacted by the pandemic such as airlines and hospitals. One such program provides advanced payments on Medicare receipts so health care providers can get cash faster.
However, the impact of the Fed increasingly wanes as debt ratings decline.
What can we learn from the Fed bailout of auto and financial companies during the 2008–09 financial crisis?
Fed measures this time have been focused on keeping the markets liquid and allowing capital to continue to be provided. It’s not a direct bailout of companies like we saw then. The Fed is attempting to provide the support needed so public markets can bridge the crisis.
The big lesson in my mind is that instead of being there to pick up the pieces when large, systemically important companies fall apart, the Fed has been ahead of the game and came through early so whole industries don’t collapse. I think that’s a much better way to do it.
Are high-yield investors being adequately paid for the additional risks they’re taking on?
People understandably focus on headline events such as bankruptcies and defaults. But despite the default rate rising, deeply troubled companies make up a small subset of the high-yield universe.
Even with the rise in defaults, returns for the high-yield asset class have been robust these past few months. The high-yield index we track has returned 25.5% from the March nadir and is up 0.64% for the year, as of July 31, 2020.
Especially over the long term, returns on high-yield bonds may provide investors willing to assume a higher risk of loss of principal with a significant income boost when compared to other debt investments, and for some investors high-yield bonds function well as part of a diversified portfolio. 
What does a rise in bankruptcies mean for people who are trying to save for retirement?
I view the impact of a rise in bankruptcies as having relatively little impact on most investors. Defaults affect a small part of the high-yield market, and many investors have small allocations to the high-yield asset class. Over time, the extra yield should compensate for the risk of default inherent in this asset class. That’s the “bargain” we’re trying to extract.
Investors can seek a diversified high-yield investment in a variety of ways. For example, they can invest in a dedicated fund such as American High-Income Trust®.  There are also funds that look for opportunities across high yield and credit more broadly, such as American Funds Multi-Sector Income Fund.℠

155,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/credit-recessionary-economy.html,The outlook for credit in a recessionary economy,Fixed Income,"May 20, 2020","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Despite support from the Federal Reserve, downgrades are poised to be more prevalent than in previous cycles
The full financial impact of COVID-19 on corporate America will become clearer over the next few quarters
For investors who can take a long-term view and be selective, current high-yield valuations are attractive
With the severity and duration of the economic downturn still unclear, investors may be wondering what this means for corporate credit, particularly the riskier high-yield sector.
We talked with Damien McCann, lead portfolio manager for American Funds Multi-Sector Income FundSM to get his perspective on the broader credit market and how companies are traversing the pandemic.
What’s your outlook from here?
We’re in a period of incredible uncertainty given the unknown path of the virus. We do know, however, that much of the economy has been significantly disrupted by the pandemic. Revenues and cash flows in many industries are currently under severe pressure. Other industries are faring much better. Second quarter earnings will be ugly but should represent the bottom for most companies. More important than second quarter earnings, however, will be what managements of companies are seeing for third and fourth quarter activity.
My base case is that the economy is beginning to improve as we speak, and that this recovery will continue through the remainder of the year and 2021. How fast is unknown. I expect an uneven recovery by industry and more volatility given the unprecedented economic disruption and the many uncertainties regarding the spread of the virus, containment efforts, and progress on therapies and vaccines.
Is this downturn different from the global financial crisis (GFC)?
Each is similar and different. Similarities with the GFC include the significant economic contraction and related sharp rise in unemployment. Both periods include significant stock and bond market volatility, as well as a seizing up of credit markets. Both periods have received significant stimulus and support by governments and central banks.
But the drivers of each downturn are very different. The GFC came from within our economy and markets. The pandemic is an exogenous shock, and the hit to economies is more severe than during the GFC. The monetary and fiscal stimulus came much faster this time around, and in much larger size, because policymakers have learned from the past and want to prevent a severe recession from becoming a financial crisis.
The Fed is actively supporting numerous markets — including U.S. Treasuries, mortgages and credit markets. Some of this, such as buying corporate bonds and ETFs, is without precedent in the U.S. In my view, these programs indicate a deep commitment by the Fed to ensure credit markets continue to function. This helps explain why credit markets have responded favorably and, after widening dramatically in mid-March to the widest levels on record for a few days, spreads recovered some of that widening later in the month.
What steps are companies taking to manage through this period?
Companies are grappling with a high level of uncertainty about the duration of the downturn. As a result, many companies are taking steps to bolster liquidity. In other words, companies are trying to build up a lot of cash so they can survive this period. Steps companies are taking to build cash include cutting operating expenses and capital outlays, reducing or eliminating dividends and share repurchases, and raising capital. 
On this last point, the Fed’s injection of liquidity and its direct participation in corporate bond markets have restored order to markets and made it possible for investment-grade companies and certain high-yield issuers to borrow again.
The combination of the Fed’s support for credit markets, and the severity and uncertainty of the downturn, has led to record levels of investment-grade bond issuance in recent months. Certain companies, such as Disney, have tapped the bond market more than once recently. What’s more, companies in the eye of the storm — including certain leisure and travel-related issuers — have been able to access markets.
What is your expectation for default rates?
I expect defaults and downgrades to be higher than in prior cycles given the severity of the economic contraction. In fact, U.S. corporate downgrades have spiked to their highest level in more than a decade in the first quarter, according to data from Standard & Poor’s.
Companies that are more exposed to economic disruption, as well as those with more leverage and less liquidity, are most vulnerable to defaulting. Despite efforts to cut costs and preserve cash, some companies won’t be able to handle the sudden near full stoppage of economic activity.
I expect downgrades to exceed previous cycles, with the potential for bankruptcies of companies in the U.S. high yield and loan market to exceed 10% over the next year.
Can you provide some color on “fallen angels” — the large companies such as Ford that have recently entered the high-yield market? How does that impact the high-yield market?
Credit rating agencies have been more aggressive with downgrades in recent years. Given the magnitude of the economic contraction I expect this to continue. There will certainly be many downgrades in the months and quarters ahead.
I also expect more companies to enter the high-yield sector. Some investors fear that a rash of supply in this sector could overwhelm the market, but keep in mind that it has actually shrunk in recent years on fewer issuances and more companies turning to the loan market. In that sense, the high-yield market could use some additional supply. Also, the Fed’s move to scoop up corporate debt should help absorb the shock. In some cases, these downgraded bonds could represent attractive investment opportunities in high-yield portfolios.
In what areas are you finding value?
As I look across the corporate market, exposure to this pandemic and economic contraction varies dramatically by industry and company. For example, at one extreme are certain insurance underwriters that have become more profitable due to fewer claims in this environment. At the opposite extreme are certain leisure companies that have seen revenues fall to zero. But even within this sector, exposure varies significantly based on the business model and balance sheet. Some leisure companies adapt and survive better than others.
The variation in exposure to the pandemic represents an incredible opportunity for deep, fundamental credit research to add value in portfolios. Our credit analysts are well versed on their companies and are in regular contact with managements. They are identifying and investing in issuers they believe have the ability to navigate this period.
Market events like this can and have historically represented a good entry point for long-term investors. Spreads today are broadly comparable to past crises and recessions, excluding the global financial crisis. I don’t believe in timing the market but do feel that current spreads provide an opportune entry point for a long-term investment strategy.
What about relative value between investment-grade and high-yield bonds? And what about the BBB-rated area of the market?
While income opportunities are higher in both investment-grade and high-yield corporates, I’ve been finding even more in high yield. In particular, the improved valuations have led to more opportunities within health care, technology companies and consumer staples.
The BBB market is huge (nearly $3T) and very diverse. The work our analysts have done suggests that a large majority of this particular market is unlikely to fall to high yield during this period. Many BBB companies are considered high quality and resilient. Some of the BBBs that fall to high yield will be attractive investment opportunities within that space, particularly if the downgrade leads to wider credit spreads.
How is Capital navigating this environment?
From a credit perspective, we are diving deep into understanding which companies will come out of this crisis intact and be able to repay their lenders. Our strong relationship with management teams and focus on fundamental credit research help us in this endeavor, as it’s our belief that that the prospects for recovery will very much be company, industry and geographically specific.
We remain very selective about our investment decisions, which are made on a security-by-security basis. This is especially important in today’s environment as downgrades and defaults become more frequent. Knowing what you’re buying helps mitigate broader credit market risks.
We also can’t stress enough the benefits of a long-term perspective, as a multiyear view may provide investors with the opportunity to capture higher returns.

If agency ratings differ, the security will be considered to have received the lowest of those ratings, consistent with the fund's investment policies. Securities in the Unrated category have not been rated by a rating agency; however, the investment adviser performs its own credit analysis and assigns comparable ratings that are used for compliance with fund investment policies. The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Investments in mortgage-related securities involve additional risks, such as prepayment risk, as more fully described in the prospectus. Higher yielding, higher risk bonds can fluctuate in price more than investment-grade bonds, so investors should maintain a long-term perspective.

156,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/coronavirus-fixed-income-questions.html,Answers to your 5 biggest Fed rate cut and bond questions,Market Volatility,"March 17, 2020","Stock markets around the world have continued to sell-off amid concerns that emergency measures by central banks and fiscal stimulus from governments will fail to ward off a global recession caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
The lack of liquidity in areas of bond markets and pricing discrepancies in pockets of the exchange-traded funds (ETF) markets led the Federal Reserve to act over the weekend of March 14 with extraordinary measures to stabilize the economy. It delivered a package that is larger in aggregate than any single move in the past. The stimulus measures included a cut in the benchmark interest rate to near zero — the second emergency rate cut this month. In addition, the Fed announced a $700 billion program to purchase Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. It also cut the rate charged to banks for short-term emergency loans from its discount window and said it would activate swap lines with five other central banks.
On March 17, the Fed announced a further measure to help companies with short-term funding to purchase commercial paper through a special credit facility. Fiscal stimulus may be on the way to help calm markets as well, with news reports suggesting that the Trump administration is pursuing a massive $850 billion stimulus package.
The bond market is in uncharted territory. The 30-year U.S. Treasury yields recently touched yields below 1%, and the 10-year dipped below 0.5% for the first time. Against this backdrop, Mike Gitlin, head of fixed income, and Pramod Atluri, principal investment officer of The Bond Fund of America®, discuss fixed income markets and the outlook for interest rates.
1. What is your outlook for interest rates, and what are your expectations from the Federal Reserve?
We believe the Fed will continue to act to support financial markets and the real economy in the coming weeks and months. As 2020 began, the market expected a pretty uneventful year from the Fed. Economic growth looked to be improving as U.S./China trade tensions eased and employment growth remained healthy.
Then the outbreak of COVID-19 and the extraordinary efforts to contain it changed everything. As the virus spread and its deadly nature became more evident, this initial supply disruption morphed into a massive demand disruption as businesses and consumers began to self-quarantine leading to reduced travel and consumption. This was then compounded by an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that led oil prices to fall more than 25% in a day, causing yet another disruption to financial markets.
Interest rates have fallen and credit spreads have widened, leading to a tightening of financial conditions. If left unchecked, this would hurt both businesses and consumers, and ultimately worsen the economic outlook.
In response, the Fed has conducted two emergency rate cuts totaling 150 basis points on March 3 and 15. This brought the monetary policy rate down to its zero bound, 0%–0.25%. Despite the cuts, financial conditions remain challenged as equity prices and credit spreads have continued to weaken. We believe the Fed will continue to act to support the economy using a variety of tools at their disposal, including a commitment to keeping rates low for the foreseeable future and potentially more large-scale asset purchases known as quantitative easing.
2. With rates in the U.S. already near zero, what other tools could the Fed employ?
Given the rapidly worsening economic outlook, the Fed was forced to act both quickly and forcefully as the sudden stop in economic activity by consumers and businesses roiled financial markets. But with the Fed funds rate now at 0% to 0.25%, we believe that reducing short-term interest rates will no longer be the primary tool of the Fed.
Many global central banks have pushed interest rates into negative territory. However, the Fed is reluctant to follow suit given differences in the structure of U.S. money markets as well as concerns over how negative interest rates would affect financial conditions in the banking system. Instead, it is more likely to lean more heavily on other tools. Those include:
Forward guidance: Telling the market to expect more stimulus in the future
More quantitative easing: Expanding its balance sheet to buy assets
Additional liquidity facilities: They may introduce additional such measures, perhaps targeting specific sectors that are facing the greatest stress
Encouraging banks to lend: They may use their authority to encourage otherwise reluctant banks to extend credit
Average inflation targeting: An explicit willingness to let inflation rise above its 2% target for a period of time, since it may be below target during another period
3. What is your outlook for credit? How do you distinguish between investment grade and high yield?
In times of enhanced uncertainty and volatility, the flight to quality is high as investors seek safety in U.S. Treasuries. If you look at credit markets, both high-yield and investment-grade bonds, the risk premium investors demand over Treasury yields can rise significantly. Corporate bonds tend to have a greater correlation to equities, so when equities decline in value, these bonds historically also decline, and high-yield bonds fall (credit spreads widen) typically much more than investment grade.
Given significant market volatility and the rapidly declining economic outlook, we are very cautious on the outlook for credit. We believe there are many scenarios where credit may continue to weaken before markets stabilize and prices improve. Over the past decade, corporations have tapped into the low interest rate environment and taken on a large amount of debt. Many companies are highly leveraged and will be vulnerable if credit spreads continue to widen. It is important to be very discriminating in the credit space, considering the increasing leverage we have seen over the past few years.
Overall, in our broad fixed income portfolios, we have generally had a long duration exposure, which translates into an exposure to interest rates, and a less-than-benchmark exposure to credit and mortgage-backed bonds. However, valuations are changing rapidly, and we are also likely to see a significant series of steps to help support markets and the economy from both central banks and fiscal authorities. Therefore, our analysts and portfolio managers look to take advantage of volatile markets to find investments in credits they like at more attractive valuations.
4. Given that we are in an environment facing constraints on both the supply side and the demand side of the economy, should investors brace for a recession in the U.S.?
Our economists believe that the U.S. has been in the late part of its economic cycle for some time. Before COVID-19 hit, investors anticipated modest growth might persist over the medium term. But the outbreak of COVID-19 and the Saudi/Russia oil shock have rapidly changed the economic outlook.
Suddenly, investors are faced with a grave new uncertainty that has caused significant disruptions. On the supply side, factories are experiencing stoppages, and both supply chains and global trade have been disrupted. On the demand side, nervous consumers and businesses may not spend as much as they would in normal times. And given the oil price collapse, the market is bracing for another wave of defaults from related sectors. This could particularly affect energy sector issuers in the high-yield market, as many of those issuers are already starting with more stretched balance sheets.
Additionally, liquidity is very challenged in the commercial paper market. If such pressures persist, they could force creditworthy businesses to issue shorter maturity commercial paper over a one- to seven-day horizon versus the usual one month. This could potentially constrain cash flows for companies even further as they would need to roll over their issuance of short-term debt more frequently. In response, the Fed has announced it will open a commercial paper lending facility for the banks.
The probability of a recession has increased dramatically from where it was just a few weeks ago. Investors should expect a period of heightened volatility. Knowing how much risk they are taking in their overall portfolio is essential, and they should consider upgrading their bond portfolios to hedge against the volatility of their equity portfolio. 
5. How should investors position bond portfolios?
The recent drop in equities and rise in price of 10-year Treasuries is a timely reminder that high-quality bonds can help to stabilize investor portfolios against losses during volatile periods. In times of great uncertainty, investors should look to bond funds first and foremost as a way to diversify their portfolio and preserve capital. But not all bonds or bond funds are created equal. There are many broad bond funds which own significant amounts of lower quality bonds that may not provide the protection and stability investors need when risk assets decline.
We would encourage investors to do a health check and ensure the bonds in their core portfolios are high quality, like U.S. government bonds, AAA-rated mortgage bonds and investment-grade corporate credit. These bonds have historically been more resilient when shocks occur, helping to preserve investors’ capital while also providing some income.
While it can be tempting to increase holdings of riskier bonds like high-yield corporate debt in a reach for yield as interest rates fall, it is important that investors know that high-yield bonds can be highly correlated to equities. When equity prices fall, so do many high-yield bonds, which means investors have not really reduced risk in their overall portfolio.
Consider the five deepest equity market corrections — those where the S&P 500 Index lost at least 12% — since the financial crisis ended. In each one, higher quality bond funds experienced solid absolute returns, on average. Importantly, during these stressed equity periods, higher quality funds as represented by the Morningstar U.S. Intermediate Core category experienced stronger returns than the Intermediate Core-Plus and Multisector Bond categories that tend to be much more exposed to the higher risk end of high-yield bonds.
This demonstrates how a strong core bond allocation can act as a ballast in an investor’s overall portfolio. A fixed income allocation should zig when stocks zag to provide some shock absorption. Our core and core-plus bond funds, including The Bond Fund of America and American Funds Strategic Bond Fund℠, aim to do this through careful attention to risk and correlation to equities.
We would urge investors to focus on the important role of bonds in an overall portfolio. When the economic outlook becomes more uncertain, we believe investors should prioritize capital preservation and diversification from equities over adding a few more basis points of yield.
Since investors never know when volatility will hit or how bad it will get, maintaining a core bond fund allocation may be their best defense against the unknown. This present episode of market volatility is not unique. Long-term investors know that bouts of volatility are a constant in the market. Even if the current scare fades, another will eventually take its place — and a recession at some point is inevitable. For this reason, we encourage investors to take a long-term view when making investment decisions and to consider whether their fixed income funds are positioned to serve their important role in maintaining a well-balanced portfolio.

158,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/5-ways-invest-corporate-bonds.html,5 ways to approach corporate bonds in a late-cycle economy,Bonds,"October 30, 2019","Amid low interest rates, investors continue to look for sources of yield, and corporate bonds have garnered substantial interest. But in the late stages of an economic cycle and with very tight credit spreads over U.S. Treasuries, how should investors approach credit markets? We spoke with Damien McCann, a portfolio manager with American Funds Strategic Bond Fund to get his take.
1. Given the current macroeconomic backdrop, how are you positioned in credit portfolios?
Economic data will remain a bit soft in the U.S. I don’t expect economic growth to accelerate to the levels that we were experiencing a year ago. That said, the recent softening seems more indicative of a leg down in the current cycle rather than the start of a recession. The Federal Reserve also maintains an accommodative stance, as we have seen with three interest rate cuts this year. Against this backdrop, I am not in a bunker in terms of how I’m building credit portfolios. Rather, it’s a modestly defensive positioning.
2. How do you plan to add value in these portfolios?
I may be oversimplifying this, but in a credit portfolio, one way to generate excess returns, or alpha, is to take a view on the direction of corporate bond spreads and be a lot more or a lot less aggressive than the market benchmark. That is one lever available to investors, but it tends to result in periods of significant underperformance whenever aggregate credit spreads move against your view.
But there’s another, what we think is a more reliable approach, which is generating returns through security selection. That means picking the right corporate bonds that have their own idiosyncratic drivers, which means they move in price based on factors that are specific to those companies and not just the macro environment. My aim is to more consistently add alpha in most market environments by identifying companies where, working with our equity analyst counterparts, we see improving fundamentals or other catalysts for gains.
3. There is a lot of focus and market attention on corporate leverage. How does that factor into your thinking and approach?
There is no doubt that corporate debt and leverage have steadily increased since 2008. Loan covenants are less stringent in many cases, and there are signs of stress in some areas of the market. There’s also considerable concern about the growth of BBB bonds to $2.9 trillion, roughly quadruple the levels of 2008. That said, it’s important to not paint the entire market with one brush. As active managers, it’s our job to identify areas of opportunity. Our credit investment analysts talk to corporate executives regularly to identify companies with credible deleveraging plans and solid long-term strategies.
Some of the increase in leverage has come from companies with noncyclical cash flows borrowing to fund acquisitions made for — what are in my view — strategically sound reasons. For example, in pharmaceuticals, Japan-based Takeda largely debt financed its acquisition of U.K.-based Shire. In health care, Cigna borrowed in the capital markets to acquire Express Scripts. And in the food industry, Conagra issued bonds to purchase Pinnacle Foods. All three acquisitions resulted in economies of scale as well as complementary businesses or products. And all three acquirers are now actively reducing leverage with free cash flow and asset sales.
Also, we are now seeing a tapering off in the pace of leverage increases among corporations, and this should continue as M&A activity has slowed down. While varying by industry, proposed acquisitions have faced more resistance to regulatory approval, giving acquirers pause. Trade uncertainty has also led companies to push out their capital expenditure plans.
4. If we do see an economic downturn or a shock to markets, what options do companies have to avoid a credit event?
Big picture, I’d say many companies can avoid a downgrade by selling assets, slashing capital expenditures, reducing dividends and/or issuing equity. These steps may not be good for stock investors, but they would be beneficial to bondholders. While none of these options are easy, it’s often preferable to a downgrade to high-yield status, which often results in higher borrowing costs and less access to financing at what may be precisely the wrong time.
While we are likely to see downgrades from investment grade to high yield during the next downturn, as we do in each down cycle, I think the level of downgrades is more likely to resemble past cycles, rather than something extraordinary.
5. Where are you finding value in corporate bonds?
I tend to buy bonds of companies that I think are cheap based on fundamental credit theses that may take years to play out and require that we take a long-term approach.
Within investment-grade corporates, I’m positive on select large pharmaceutical companies. They may have leveraged up to do an acquisition, but there’s high visibility of free cash flow, so they can deleverage quickly. And the business models tend to be very resilient in economic slowdowns.
Meanwhile, in the energy sector, many issuers remain cautious with their balance sheets after the sharp oil price decline we saw several years ago. At the same time, new project investments will likely lead to higher earnings, and planned asset sales should result in some deleveraging of balance sheets.
In high yield, we also see opportunities in pharmaceuticals, especially in companies that are deleveraging and selling assets. Another set of companies that interests me are the fee-based data-centric technology companies that enjoy very sticky demand and generate free cash flow capable of servicing elevated debt loads even in periods of economic downturn.
On the rating spectrum, BB-rated corporates look overvalued on average, while CCC-rated corporate bond spreads have drifted wider and now offer value in select pockets. Companies are rated CCC because they have issues, so one must be very careful and the credit selection has to be backed by very intensive analysis, but there are investment opportunities to be found.
All in all, my current focus is on companies that are less sensitive to the economic cycle or have clearly laid out deleveraging plans. And being selective is key — not by sector, but a company-by-company, credit-by-credit selection.

159,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/muni-questions-answered.html,Muni mania: Why municipal bonds are breaking records in 2019,Municipal Bonds,"September 24, 2019","Municipal bonds have soared in popularity over the past year. A wave of investor money has flowed into the asset class — prompting some in the financial media to crown municipal bonds “2019’s hottest asset.” 
Municipal bond funds raked in more investor money in the first four months of 2019 than they typically do in a “good“ year. And by mid-2019, year-to-date inflows had exceeded $45 billion — more than 10 times the amount of new investor money gathered over the whole of 2018.
In recent months, muni bond yields (which move inversely to bond prices) tumbled — setting records as trade tensions and faltering global growth bolstered the appeal of safe-haven assets.
Despite the asset class’s rising popularity, question marks hover over the market. Whether you’re new to the nearly $4 trillion municipal bond market — or are revisiting an existing tax-exempt bond allocation — here are answers to today’s key questions.
1. Following tax reform, are munis just for high net worth investors?
The asset class is certainly enjoying a season in the sun. And yet, despite increased demand, the myth that a permanent muni allocation only really makes sense for the very wealthiest persists.
Truth is, this perception is seldom correct: Historically, munis have often been a relatively attractive source of after-tax income for any investor outside the lowest tax brackets.
What’s the current situation? Even with muni yields near multiyear lows, after-tax yields have continued to exceed those of taxable bonds for anyone whose marginal tax rate is 24% or higher — well below the top tax rate of 37%.
2. Where do municipal bonds fit in a portfolio?
There’s no escaping it: The after-tax income offered by municipal bonds isn’t what it used to be. Strong investor demand at a time of relatively modest issuance has seen yields trend lower.
And yet, as discussed, the asset class remains a relatively attractive option for income seekers. In the past year or so, the yield advantage of municipals over taxables has mostly been greatest among high-yield bonds (for those willing to assume the increased risk associated with high-yield bonds) — averaging about 1.5 percentage points since tax reform was passed at the end of 2017.
In addition to income, municipal bonds can provide another potential benefit for balanced portfolios: equity diversification. Indeed, both investment-grade and high-yield municipals have often shown modest correlation to U.S. equities, an attribute that is especially attractive in unsettled times.
Munis can help balanced portfolios in three possible ways:
If you’re looking to move cash off the sidelines. Cash gives investors liquidity and can also offer refuge amid volatility. But holding too much cash (or cash equivalents) can mean forgoing potential investment gains. As the Federal Reserve forges ahead with rate cuts, investors who feel it’s time to reallocate cash — and are comfortable taking on some investment risk — may view shorter term higher quality muni strategies as an attractive option.
By upgrading your core bond allocation. Higher quality munis can provide ballast in an equity-heavy portfolio, serving three of the four roles of fixed income — income, equity diversification and capital preservation.
By diversifying portfolio income. High-yield corporates are a popular portfolio choice for greater income (for investors willing to assume the higher risk, compared to investment-grade debt, of those investments). However, they aren’t a good diversifier because they have tended to rise and fall with equities. Complementing traditional high yield with comparably rated munis can be a double win for investors. Doing so offers a different source of higher income and, critically, can enhance equity diversification potential. That said, it’s worth noting that lower rated bonds can be quite volatile. Furthermore, the flipside of increased popularity is that lower muni yields provide less compensation for the risks entailed. These considerations underscore that it’s prudent to limit allocations to high-yield munis (and other riskier corners of the bond market).
3. Should I choose a state-specific or national municipal bond strategy?
How someone answers this question will hinge on their ZIP code as well as their financial circumstances. That said, the decision really does boil down to weighing the potential tradeoff between tax benefit and market opportunity.
In simple terms, residents of states with higher taxes stand to gain a greater tax advantage from strategies focused solely on in-state municipal bonds (because that investment income is typically exempt from state, as well as federal, income tax).
Assessing in-state muni opportunities is a little more involved. The market landscape varies from state to state as much as the actual terrain. California and New York, for example, each include diverse issuers and many thousands of municipal bonds. In contrast, the number of in-state bonds in less populous places may only amount to several hundred or fewer. Yields also vary quite meaningfully from state to state.
We put these considerations into a simplified framework, illustrated below. The conclusion is clear: State-specific strategies may offer some compelling potential advantages for residents of New York and California. Elsewhere, the potential tradeoff between tax benefit and market opportunity makes a strong argument for taking a closer look at national strategies.
4. With talk of recession growing louder, how safe are municipal bonds?
Recent market developments — including the inversion of the yield curve — have left some investors wondering if a recession is near. At times like these, it’s natural to revisit the level of risk in portfolios.
To the uninitiated, municipal bonds may seem like a risky asset class. After all, munis have often made headlines for the wrong reasons. Notable examples include Detroit’s 2013 bankruptcy and the debt crisis that erupted in Puerto Rico in 2015. 
The facts, however, paint a different picture. In 2017, for example, Standard & Poor’s counted 64 defaults from U.S. companies and 20 from municipals. Recent history suggests that, over time, the percentage of rated municipal bonds that typically default is comparable to what has been observed among similarly rated U.S. corporates. Of course, default rates vary across market cycles. It’s also important to note: Historical data may underestimate actual default rates due to unrated bonds being excluded from the analysis.
5. What are the differences between general obligation and revenue bonds?
Often, when investors think about munis they have general obligation (GO) bonds in mind. By far, California and New York are the most frequent issuers of GOs. Typically, GOs are backed by the credit and taxing power of a state or local authority.
Some investors are, therefore, surprised to learn that most munis are revenue bonds, not GOs. Revenue bonds account for about 70% of investment-grade munis; hospitals, colleges and other providers of essential services issue these bonds. Each bond is backed by a dedicated revenue stream from a specific project, and therefore has very little connection to state and local government finances.
Fundamental research can provide a clear assessment of credit risk in revenue bonds, which have typically offered higher yields than GOs. In contrast, local government issuers face practical constraints on raising revenue. Politics and pensions are frequently significant factors. There can, therefore, be a lot more nuance and judgment involved in assessing whether GO bonds offer investors adequate compensation for the risks entailed.
Final thoughts
Municipal bonds can play an important role in the core and enhanced fixed income allocations of portfolios. Amid high valuations, emphasizing higher quality municipal bonds may make sense. Investors looking to add exposure may also want to consider waiting for market setbacks to offer more attractive entry points.
That being said, the municipal bond market is vast. With nearly $4 trillion in bonds outstanding, there will continue to be areas that are not as closely researched by investors.
“It’s a great time to be an active muni investor,” says Mark Marinella, a portfolio manager for several funds and separately managed accounts, including Limited Term Tax-Exempt Bond Fund of America® and The Tax-Exempt Fund of California®. “From the shape of the municipal bond yield curve, to opportunities in healthcare and relative value in housing sector munis, research is helping us uncover truly varied opportunities.”

161,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/yield-curve-inverts-negative-rates.html,"As the yield curve inverts, will the U.S. see negative interest rates?",Interest Rates,"August 20, 2019","Worries about economic recession, subdued inflation and a flight to quality have led interest rates in the U.S. to plummet in recent weeks. The flight to safety has helped push 30-year U.S. Treasury yields below 2% for the first time ever.
Significantly, two-year yields moved above those of 10-year Treasuries — an inversion of the yield curve that has often been a signal of approaching recession.
The question now being asked is: Can interest rates in the U.S. go negative, as they have in Japan, Germany and some other countries in Europe? The probability seems higher than ever before and cannot be entirely ruled out. However, many Capital Group portfolio managers and economists don’t see it happening in the near term.
Even if they don’t turn negative, interest rates in the U.S. are likely to remain quite low, anchored by global demand for a positive yielding safe haven asset and Federal Reserve policy that remains highly accommodative.
1. Will bond yields turn negative?
Negative yields have been a feature of bond markets in Japan and the eurozone for years. As of early August, for example, 100% of German government bonds (bunds) had negative yields.
Despite the recent tumble in Treasury yields, “it seems unlikely that negative yields will come to the U.S. in the near term, given my outlook for modest economic growth,” says Pramod Atluri, portfolio manager for The Bond Fund of America®. “That said, if the four-decade downward trend in rates remains intact, ‘the zero bound’ could eventually be crossed.”
“Negative policy rates are, in my view, a remote possibility for the U.S. over the next few years,” says Tim Ng, a fixed income investment analyst. “I think the Fed’s playbook is more likely to follow what was done in the financial crisis: progressively cut rates to zero if needed and use forward guidance as a tool. The Fed could also buy bonds, as we saw with their quantitative easing efforts.”
Nevertheless, policymakers are keeping a close eye, and central bankers will likely discuss all options for this scenario at their annual gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on August 22–24. The event should shed more light on the Fed’s current views on negative bond yields and, indeed, policy rates.
The topic has taken center stage once more, with the total amount of subzero bonds in the developed world hitting a record high in August of more than $15.4 trillion. This figure easily beats the previous peak of $12 trillion in 2016. Today, a little over a quarter of investment-grade bonds in developed global markets now offer a negative yield.
Negative yields essentially mean that investors are paying the issuer to hold their money. That generally happens during times of economic uncertainty, when buyers rush to snap up investments viewed as safe.
Negative yielding debt used to be contained to short-term investments — think two years or less — but recently the phenomenon has spilled over into longer dated five- and 10-year notes more significantly than in the past. Bonds backing the eurozone’s go-to safe haven, Germany, are broadly in negative territory with the 30-year bund yield negative for the first time.
2. If not negative, will U.S. rates remain extremely low?
Even though the financial professionals featured in this article don’t expect them to turn negative, U.S. interest rates are likely to remain low for several reasons:
There is global demand for positive yielding high-quality bonds. 
Despite trade tensions, rising U.S. government debt and recession worries, Treasuries continue to be viewed as a safe-haven asset — especially in times of uncertainty. This has underpinned global demand for the securities across all maturities. They are also relatively attractive, compared to the negative yields offered by Germany and Japan, for example, assuming an investor is comfortable with buying on an unhedged basis.
The Fed is maintaining a highly accommodative stance.
Weaker global growth has encouraged the Fed to maintain a highly accommodative stance, even though U.S. economic growth remains decent and the labor market is strong.
While the core Consumer Price Index has moved above 2%, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index at 1.6% has remained well below the Fed’s inflation target, giving the central bank flexibility to further ease monetary policy. Inflation expectations have also remained muted. Markets have been pricing in five more rate cuts by the Fed by the end of 2020 following the 25-basis-point cut in July to put the Federal funds rate in a range from 2% to 2.25%.
Inflationary pressures have been low in much of the developed world. The slowdown in China, which has been one of the biggest consumers of industrial commodities, has also helped keep a lid on inflation.
Structural reasons may also help explain the lack of inflation. Labor costs have been contained as many industries turn to automation or make use of cheaper labor from elsewhere. Demographics are another likely cause. 
”Global population trends point toward a near-term future where growth remains low in the U.S. and many other places,” says economist Anne Vandenabeele. “These developments, in combination with cheaper and more powerful technology, could also continue to depress inflation and yields globally.”
So, as populations age and expand more slowly, cheaper and better technology (around automation, for example) reduces the need for capital investments that can help the economy grow. Rather than undertake capital expenditure, many firms have instead funneled their cash into mergers and acquisitions, buybacks and financial assets more broadly, which has also helped push bond yields lower.
The appeal of safe bonds will continue as the world grapples with weak regional economic activity. Meanwhile, global economic pressures tied to the well-trodden themes around the slowing population growth, an aging workforce and technological innovation aren’t going anywhere. The low-yield environment looks to be with us for quite some time.
We are in the late stage of a global economic cycle.
China is experiencing an economic slowdown as the trade war with the U.S. slowed its second-quarter GDP to 6.2% from the prior quarter’s figure of 6.4%, and 6.6% in 2018. Many other developed economies are slowing. Germany reported a contraction, with GDP declining 0.1% in the second quarter on an annualized basis. Elsewhere, the fallout from Brexit has weighed on the UK’s economy, which most recently reported that GDP contracted 0.2% for the three months ended June.
3. Does the inverted yield curve signal a recession?
After more than a decade, a closely watched portion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve has inverted. In August, 10-year Treasury yields moved below two-year yields for the first time since the start of the great financial crisis in 2007.
Alongside other market and economic signals, this particular type of yield curve inversion is regarded as a harbinger of recession.
How worried should investors be? An inverted yield curve is clearly a bearish development, because it indicates that many investors believe future growth prospects will be lower than nearer term growth. Furthermore, inversion has preceded every U.S. recession over the past 50 years.
And yet, history also shows that 10-year yields falling below two-year yields is no cause for immediate panic. There has often been quite a lag between inversion and the start of recession — 16 months on average.
Economic and market indicators offer a way to take the temperature of the U.S. economy. One or two negative readings could be meaningless. But when several key indicators start flashing red for a sustained period, the picture becomes clearer and far more significant. That time has yet to arrive.
Although some imbalances are developing, they don’t seem extreme enough to derail U.S. economic growth in the near term. The culprit that ultimately sinks the current expansion may one day be obvious: Escalating trade disputes, falling consumer and business confidence, or unsustainable debt levels can be major triggers.

View transcript
Will McKenna: I know credit risk has been a theme that you and the team have been talking about for some time. And perhaps investors were more focused on interest rate risk and not enough on credit risk. Talk more about that. Where do you see that today? Obviously, in corporate bonds and in high yield. Are we still at that kind of cautious place?
Mike Gitlin: Yeah. If you look back at 2018, what we heard all the time from folks out there was that they worried about interest rate risk. That rates were going up, that the Fed was hiking. And now, we have the opposite, where if you look at how the market's pricing and what may happen with the Fed, the market's now pricing in two cuts for the rest of 2019, and then two cuts in 2020.
So just six, eight months ago, there were three hikes expected and now four cuts in the next two years. So there's a dramatic switch in terms of how people are perceiving interest rate risk. We've been long duration, so our view has been we didn't worry as much as some others on interest rate risk. But we are worried on credit risk. When you look at investment-grade and high-yield spreads, and they're basically on the border of the richest quartile or the second quartile of richness, we get worried from a valuation standpoint. 
Will McKenna: And this will tie into this big change in bond land around Morningstar splitting that intermediate category into core, core-plus. Pretty connected into this topic, I believe.
Mike Gitlin: It sure is.
Will McKenna: You kind of referenced it, but we have been talking about the shift from QE to QT, and maybe its shift back. But tell me, what's your view on that now? Is something fundamentally changed? Are we on a different path altogether, or is it a pause in the path, or —
Mike Gitlin: It's a different path altogether. You know, the Fed had made some progress in reducing its balance sheet. So at its peak it was about $4.5 trillion. Over the last few years, it's now come down to $3.7 trillion. But in September, they're stopping. So the balance sheet will pause at about $3.7 trillion. So what we saw as QT is effectively ending. And that's the Fed acknowledging some slower growth around the world that Darrell referenced, and also, quite frankly, a view that the equity market risk was relatively high. When we look at the Fed pivot, there are lots of folks who thought it might be related to the executive branch, or the President. And in actuality, it was more about global growth, in our view, and the equity market 20% decline we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018.

163,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/portfolio-makeover-bonds.html,Portfolio makeover: Are there hidden risks in your bonds?,Asset Allocation,"May 30, 2019","Christopher Kiesel manages money in Hilton Head, South Carolina, a tranquil resort and retirement community. His firm, Oak Advisors, gets its name from the region’s stately oak trees, blanketed in Spanish moss. It’s the type of place that moves at a slower, more relaxed pace.
Except, that is, for Kiesel. Because Oak Advisors serves a client base primarily made up of wealthy retirees, protection is the guiding principle. And it’s his job to play defense.
“I try to watch out for ‘land mines,’” says Kiesel, a CFA® charterholder. “I don’t want to buy into something that gives our portfolios a risk I didn’t know about and have it blow up on us.”
It was this concern that led Oak Advisors to our Portfolio Consulting and Analytics Team in 2018. After performing one of the portfolio analysis reviews we offer to financial advisors, we found a potential issue hiding in — of all places — the firm’s bond allocations. “We were already using several mutual funds with credit risk,” Kiesel explains. “And we were finding the funds we considered core fixed income might be too exposed to credit risk in general, and wouldn’t be appropriate as an equity hedge.”
While it’s not always easy to see the risks in fixed income, and harder still to convince investors that they exist, our work reviewing countless portfolios each year helps us point out blind spots. Lately we are finding a good deal of risk hidden in core bond allocations. After years of reaching for yield in lower quality issues, many core strategies have shifted away from the roles bonds are designed to play, including diversification from equities, capital preservation and inflation protection.
Underscoring this issue, Morningstar recently split the once “big tent” intermediate term bond category in two, separating core bond funds from core-plus strategies that take more credit risks. As a result, some big name bond funds received lower ratings in their new categories.
To help you spot hidden risks in your bond allocations, this portfolio makeover tackles three common fixed income issues and serves as a case study for ways to add stability to your portfolios.
Issue 1: Not enough diversification from equities
A primary role of fixed income allocations is to offer counterbalance or stability when equities are volatile. You want your bonds to hold up when stocks go down. The best way to test this is to measure the correlation between stocks and bonds in your portfolio. Lower is generally better and means you have more diversification.
Some investors overlook this important correlation metric and screen bond funds in the same way they screen equities, based on performance rather than how they pair with the overall portfolio. The result is bonds that act like stocks in some ways, leaving the portfolio vulnerable during a market downturn.
Action: Go back to basics with government bonds.
From a diversification perspective, it’s hard to beat U.S. Treasuries. They are negatively correlated with equities and tend to offer downside protection when stock prices fall. Municipal bonds also provide a low correlation to equities and historically low default rates. And recent changes to tax law make muni bonds potentially even more appealing.
In Kiesel’s portfolio, corporate issues went from representing almost half of the fixed income portfolio to a more balanced 37.6%. Those proceeds were used to increase the allocation of government bonds from 14.7% to 22.8%. Municipal bonds in the portfolio increased from 5.9% to 9.0%. More importantly, the portfolio’s three-year correlation compared to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index went from .57 to just .18.
Issue 2: Too much credit risk in the portfolio
In a protracted low-yield environment, it’s natural to want to trade some credit risk for potentially higher returns. That’s why high-yield debt has been so enticing in recent years. But when non-investment grade debt starts to pervade the portfolio, investors may lose the diversification and stability that bonds are meant to provide. In a late-cycle economy, overexposure to lower quality credit can be particularly risky.
Action: Focus on quality at the core.
Since Morningstar split the intermediate term bond category, most investors might realize they have too much allocated to core-plus and not enough to core. Investors should evaluate whether there’s a need to rebalance those positions and separate quality fixed income positions from riskier or more speculative ones. Investing in a true core bond fund can help provide stability without surprises, leaving investors better situated to weather market conditions.
Even in core-plus positions, it’s important to keep an eye on quality. One compelling example is emerging markets debt, a surprisingly compelling alternative to high-yield bonds. This asset class is not as risky as it once was, but you can still get relatively high income from it. Emerging markets debt also has a lower correlation to equities compared to high-yield bonds, although some of the diversification comes from currencies and other regional idiosyncrasies that can add some risk. 
“Having a fund that’s positioned to do what we expect it to do in various scenarios is a good core fixed income position for us,” Kiesel says. Implementing a true core fund reduced the firm’s positions in high-yield, floating-rate and strategic income opportunity funds to make room for less risky debt. The overall credit quality of the portfolio improved, with the highest quality bonds representing more than 32% of fixed income, up from just under 17%. Issues rated BB were brought down from 23% to a more reasonable 13.6%. Similarly, B rated holdings went from representing 14.5% of the portfolio to 4.7%.
Issue 3: Not enough variety in duration
“What gets us into trouble is not what we don’t know, but what we know for sure that just ain’t so.” This quote is sometimes attributed to Mark Twain, but it could easily describe fixed income investors who take large positions on specific durations in an effort to reduce interest rate risk, only to be exposed to more volatility as the yield curve shifts.
It’s also possible to successfully hedge against one type of risk only to trade it for another. When the Federal Reserve seemed poised to raise rates in 2018, for example, many investors attempted to mitigate interest rate risk through the use of floating-rate bank loans. The non-investment grade loans are issued by banks and made up of loans made to companies in need of funding, and are not as sensitive to interest rate changes. But rates did not rise, leading investors to reconsider this exposure in early 2019.
Action: Let your objectives guide duration.
Rather than try to guess which way the yield curve will move next, investors should focus on the goals they are trying to meet. Quality investment opportunities can be found across the duration spectrum. Your bond strategies should have the flexibility to take advantage of them. 
In Kiesel’s portfolio, we recommended a reduction in holdings with maturities between five to seven years from 24.1% to 16.9%. Meanwhile, holdings with 20- to 30-year maturities increased from 7.9% to 15.7%. And holdings with maturities of 30 or more years increased from 4.6% to 7.7%. Overall the average duration of the portfolio went from 2.37 years to 4.15.
With these risks uncovered and remedied, Kiesel is feeling almost as relaxed as his client base. “I have confidence that we aren’t going to have any surprises,” he concludes. “Everything should operate as we expect.”

Municipal Bonds
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable. Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness. If agency ratings differ, the security will be considered to have received the highest of those ratings, consistent with the fund's investment policies. Securities in the unrated category have not been rated by a rating agency; however, the investment adviser performs its own credit analysis and assigns comparable ratings that are used for compliance with fund investment policies.
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.

164,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/morningstar-core-bond-split.html,Bond shake-up: What you need to know about Morningstar splitting out the core,Bonds,"May 21, 2019","It’s the biggest shake-up in bond fund investing in years. Here’s what you need to know about Morningstar’s major category changes.
Morningstar split the $1.6 trillion Intermediate-Term Bond category in half.
The new categories are Intermediate Core and Intermediate Core-Plus.
Funds with less than 5% in high yield will become part of the Intermediate Core category.
Most other funds with more high yield exposure will move to Intermediate Core-Plus.
We expect many investors could decide to reallocate assets from Core-Plus to Core.
The hunt for yield in a low-rate world has led to an uncomfortable truth: Many strategies regarded as core fixed income are not what they seem. It turns out we weren’t the only ones to take notice. To help investors more easily compare similar types of bond funds, Morningstar announced a major category shake-up.
We sat down with Capital Group fixed income investment director Luke Farrell to get his take on what’s happened and why it’s a big deal for advisors.
How did Morningstar change its $1.6 trillion Intermediate-Term Bond category?
Intermediate-Term Bond included more than 300 funds and was the largest bond category in terms of assets — roughly four times bigger than the next largest. This category was retired on April 30 and replaced with two new categories: Intermediate Core Bond and Intermediate Core-Plus Bond.
Before the split, almost all funds with a duration (a measure of sensitivity to prevailing interest rates) between three and seven years that held less than 35% in high-yield bonds were grouped into the huge Intermediate-Term Bond category.
However, the funds within this old category tended to fall into one of two very different camps. There were those that generally invested in U.S. investment-grade bonds and possibly held very modest exposure to high yield.
Then there were others that had strayed more into higher risk investments, and in larger concentrations, in an attempt to boost yield and total returns in a low interest rate market. These strategies offered the potential for higher returns, but had a materially different risk-return profile. Additionally, these strategies had a higher correlation with U.S. equities and had the potential for larger negative returns.
Morningstar recognized this “scope creep” or “style drift” within the category and saw the potential for investors to not recognize the inherent risk in these funds. They therefore divided the old Intermediate-Term Bond category in two.
Going forward, fixed income funds averaging less than 5% of holdings rated below investment grade will be in the new Intermediate Core category. Most other funds — with between 5% and 35% of holdings rated below investment grade — now belong to the new Intermediate Core-Plus category.
This is great news for investors because now there’s a clear delineation between Core and Core-Plus, allowing for a clearer comparison of funds and their associated risks.
Why is it so important that Morningstar is splitting out core fixed income?
For the past decade, I’ve crisscrossed America meeting advisors and consultants. I’ve seen unintentional risks in fixed income portfolios become a frequent and routine problem.
Providing stability when the stock market stumbles should be one of the key roles of fixed income. And yet, all too often, what an advisor thought was a core fixed income allocation was a fund or funds dominated by high yield, offering more volatile returns and less downside protection.
The old category had funds with major differences in holdings and approaches, which meant that funds could have dramatically different outcomes in certain market conditions. That was far from ideal for the many advisors who look to fixed income to help them create balance and stability in client portfolios.
The new categories will help advisors more easily distinguish between the risk profiles of different types of bond funds. This, in turn, should reduce confusion about the nature of bond allocations and empower advisors to make even more informed decisions.
What would you say to advisors who view this as little more than a label change?
I’d urge them to revisit why their clients own fixed income. A portfolio’s core fixed income allocation is meant to serve as ballast. Everyone knows the stock market can be volatile. Core bond funds should counterbalance that volatility and provide some stability and downside ballast.
Core-Plus has a place in portfolio construction. However, if your goal is a balanced risk portfolio, Core-Plus should never be the bulk of fixed income, but rather complement the core fixed income allocation.
Do you expect Morningstar’s decision to prompt big changes in fixed income allocations?
Newfound clarity on core could, in my view, spark a significant reallocation of fixed income assets over the next year.
Many advisors may now find themselves with a fund designated as Core-Plus by Morningstar — even though they intended it to serve as part of a core allocation focused on diversification and capital preservation. Similarly, the change could pose some tough questions for fiduciaries in the retirement space if a target date fund now has most of its fixed income exposure in Core-Plus, for instance.
Some popular high-profile funds that moved to the Core-Plus category have also seen their Morningstar rating slide. At a minimum, I think these developments alone will see many advisors weighing whether they remain comfortable with their fixed income choices over the coming months.
To begin to explore whether a fund could be a centerpiece for fixed income investments, I suggest two simple steps: determine its exposure to below investment-grade bonds and examine how tightly correlated a fund’s returns are to equity market returns.
If, for example, I encountered a portfolio where most of the fixed income allocation was to a fund with a high yield exposure of more than 5% and correlation above 0.3, that would give me pause.
Will the changes affect Capital’s approach — what about in models and fund-of-fund strategies?
No, if anything, it supports what we’ve said for years about the importance of having bond funds that behave like bond funds. The new categories align well with our view of fixed income within the broader context of multi-asset investing.
We have long believed that core fixed income should provide stability in a broader asset allocation. Our flagship core bond fund, The Bond Fund of America®, for example, is designed to meet this need.
We are also big believers in our approach to active management. Of course, any fund can lag its benchmark over certain periods. However, by design, passive strategies seek to track – not beat – their benchmarks. With The Bond Fund of America now the largest actively managed fund in Intermediate Core, I’m hopeful that more advisors will come around to our way of thinking.
Importantly, I absolutely believe that there is a role and a need for Core-Plus strategies. Analysis shows that a 75% Core/25% Core-Plus blend can be very “efficient” — offering the potential for a theoretically optimal trade-off of portfolio risk and return.
American Funds Strategic Bond FundSM should stand out in the new Intermediate Core-Plus category. This fund is a Core-Plus strategy, yet relies less on high yield and more on interest rate-driven strategies and other sectors as its source of potential returns. I think this approach, majoring in rate exposures and minoring in credit, will appeal to advisors looking for a balanced approach. Because of its design, the fund can offer investors the potential for lower correlation to equity markets and meaningful downside protection.
While Morningstar’s new categories won’t alter what we do at Capital, the change offers a timely opportunity for advisors and investors to take a step back and think about what they want from their fixed income.
Arguably, in today’s late-cycle environment, being well prepared for more unsettled markets should be front and center. That means getting your core fixed income right.

Tax reform has boosted the popularity and usefulness of tax-exempt bonds in surprising ways.
Municipal bonds are one of the best remaining tax-advantaged vehicles.
A variety of muni strategies can help investors control their tax liabilities.
Changes brought by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, being felt for the first time as individuals prepare their 2018 returns, are turning municipal bonds into a sought-after asset class. As investors realize that tax-advantaged moves are harder to find under the new rules, municipal bonds may be their best bet.
“Everyone kind of had their heads in the sand last year as to what this tax law really meant,” says Marilyn Cohen of El Segundo, California-based Envision Capital Management, a firm known for its focus on municipal bonds with more than $400 million in assets under management. “Now reality is hitting them.”
Prices of municipal bonds are rising as buyers jump into the market. The Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index, which moves opposite of yield, is up more than 2% this year. Compare that with the roughly 1% decline for the same period in 2018.
Why all the muni madness? It’s a bit of a course correction from the initial impression that tax reform would hurt munis, which pay interest that’s generally tax exempt from federal (and sometimes state) taxes. Tax reform cut the top tax bracket to 37% from 39.6%, and business owners with pass-through income scored a tax break. It was logical to think that lower taxes for high net worth individuals could hurt the relative appeal of munis, especially for those in the very highest brackets.
In reality the opposite happened. Tax reforms took away several important deductions, most importantly capping the deductibility of state and local taxes at $10,000 annually. Meanwhile, the standard deduction doubled, meaning very few tax payers will still take advantage of itemized deductions. That leaves muni bonds as one of the last legitimate tax-advantaged vehicles for many investors.
“You can’t deduct as much as you once could,” explains Jeff Brooks, wealth strategist at Capital Group, home of American Funds. “That makes tax-exempt income strategies all the more appealing.”
That’s why many advisors building portfolios see even more relative value from munis. “We can look at REITs and preferreds and that kind of thing, but if [you] want to reduce taxable income, then munis are the way to go,” Cohen says.
To help investors asking about municipal bonds, we spoke with several financial advisors who we consider “muni masters” to learn their best strategies. Here are six ways investors can use munis to navigate the new tax law.
1. Put munis in the right place.
Clients often need both taxable and tax-exempt bonds in their portfolio. Knowing where to put them is a key role for the advisor, says James Frazier, managing director and CPA at Frazier Financial Advisors. After determining what a portfolio’s fixed income allocation should be, Frazier heavily weights taxable bonds in IRA accounts and the tax-exempt portion in non-IRA accounts. Treating municipal bonds separately and uniquely can give clients an opportunity for high-yield bond-type yields at a fraction of the risk.
Why treat munis as their own asset class? Taxes on taxable bonds held in an IRA can be controlled by deciding when to take distributions. As for the muni portion? Let’s say you have a client in the 37% tax bracket who also pays the 3.8% Medicare tax plus 5% state tax, Frazier explains. Adjusting for taxes, a state muni bond yielding 3% sees its tax-equivalent yield jump to nearly 6%. That’s the 3% yield divided by 1 minus the total tax rate as shown.
“We feel very comfortable using non-IRA money for the tax-exempt portion of client portfolios,” Frazier says.
2. Consider munis rather than cash, even in smaller accounts.
Darrell Pesek, director of the Ashcroft Pesek Group in Houston, finds a variation of this strategy can also be beneficial. A vast majority of the firm’s $2 billion in assets under management are held in ExxonMobil employees’ IRAs. Where municipal bonds come in is when clients receive large taxable distributions in the form of non-qualified pensions and executive compensation benefits at retirement. Sometimes this cash piles up after clients begin taking required minimum distributions at age 70½. Pesek uses municipal bonds as a way to drive higher yields than a savings account would offer, while controlling the tax impact.
He says municipals are solid choices even for clients not in the highest tax brackets. “You get a lot of bang for your buck on the muni side,” Pesek states.
3. Use munis to reduce taxable events during equity downturns.
Munis can help temper client emotions, which offers a tangential — call it a behavioral — tax benefit. Because municipal bond prices have tended to move independently of stocks, a portfolio cushioned with munis will likely be less volatile during periods of market disruption.
When clients see a more tranquil overall portfolio, they may be less tempted to rashly sell stock holdings. In that way, muni bonds’ historically lower correlation with stocks can help to reduce taxable capital gains generated from emotionally selling during market volatility.
“[Munis have tended to be] less volatile, especially in corrections, so clients are more likely to stay the course and not sell out of equity positions,” Frazier adds.
4. Pay special attention to munis for trusts.
The tax rates for trusts ramp up quickly. For 2018 the highest 37% tax rate applied when the taxable income of a trust topped $12,500 (that 37% bracket income threshold rose to $12,750 in 2019). So holding tax-exempt municipal bonds in a trust, versus other taxable investments, can help lower taxable income and delay hitting the 37% rate, Frazier explains.
According to Brooks, these “compressed” tax brackets apply to retained income in non-grantor trusts. In other words, income in trusts responsible for paying their own taxes benefit from the tax-exempt aspect of muni bond income.
In some trusts the creator or “grantor” of the trust or the beneficiaries are responsible for the income tax liability generated by trust-earned income. There’s additional good news for munis in these trusts. Even if the grantor or beneficiary is responsible for paying income tax on trust-earned income, the “character” of that income — tax-exempt income in the case of municipal bonds — is retained. The income may be tax free no matter who the responsible taxpayer is.
5. Set investors' expectations about municipal bonds' tax powers.
It’s important for investors to understand that municipal bond funds can still incur taxes. The interest paid by municipal bond funds is typically tax exempt, but that’s not the case with capital gains. When funds sell municipal bonds it may incur a capital gain, which should be explained to investors in advance. “We see a lot of confusion [from clients],” says Frazier, adding that he believes it’s worth the trade-off.
Medicare premiums for investors aged 65 or older are another important consideration. These premiums are deducted monthly from Social Security payments based on adjusted gross income. But interest paid by municipal bonds is added back to income for Medicare premium calculation purposes — just as is the interest paid by taxable bonds. “Tax-exempt bonds are very favorable for income tax and Medicare tax purposes,” Frazier adds. “However, when it comes to your Medicare premium, [the interest] is added back in.”
It’s also important to note that income from certain municipal bonds — those typically used to fund private projects like stadiums — may still be taxable for taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). But tax reform raised the AMT income thresholds, meaning fewer taxpayers will be subject to it. Income from municipal bonds can also increase how much of your Social Security benefit is taxable.
6. Don't let the tax tail wag the municipal bond dog.
There can be additional state tax benefits from buying in-state municipal bonds, but doing so can increase exposure to state-specific risks. To adjust, Frazier typically invests in funds that buy municipal bond securities issued by multiple states.
“Diversification is primary. Tax savings is secondary,” he says. “Tax is not the only driver.”

Tax reform sparks an unusual muni yield curve opportunity.
Not-for-profit hospitals can reward the patient investor.
Housing munis offer a structural yield advantage.
2019 is already shaping up to be a good year for muni investing. And that comes on the heels of several years of positive market returns. Who said Fed rate hikes are bad for bonds?
As a portfolio manager for several funds and separately managed accounts — including Limited Term Tax-Exempt Bond Fund of America® and The Tax-Exempt Fund of California® — I’m seeing truly varied opportunities in municipal bonds.
I’ll highlight three of them here. First, the shape of the municipal bond yield curve — which is quite steep relative to the Treasury yield curve — offers compelling value. I am also finding opportunity in the continuing wave of consolidation among not-for-profit hospitals. Finally, there are persistently attractive valuations in housing.
1. Tax reform sparks an unusual muni yield curve opportunity.
The shape of any bond curve is a big deal for bond investors. When curves are steep, the additional yield offered by longer maturity bonds can be very enticing. It’s surprising that the potential benefit of managing curve exposure in munis isn’t more widely known.
In the few years since the Federal Reserve embarked on its most recent hiking cycle, for example, returns across the curve have varied meaningfully.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 has also been a game changer for the curve — altering the balance of muni bond supply and demand. Before tax reform was enacted in December 2017, there was a surge of muni bond issuance.
Mindful that cheap refinancing through so-called advanced refunding bonds looked set to become much trickier, states and other issuers rushed to market. This increased the supply of bonds and put downward pressure on muni bond prices. (Recall that bond prices move inversely to yields.)
At the same time, tax reform cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, diminishing the advantage of holding municipals for U.S. banks and insurance companies. Historically, banks and insurers have been important investors in munis with maturities of 20 years or longer.
Consequently, the steepness of the muni curve relative to the Treasury yield curve has increased thanks to a smaller supply of muni bonds on the whole and lower demand for longer term munis.
So how exactly can an investor seek to benefit from the muni curve’s relative steepness? The basic idea is that, sooner or later, the divergence between the two curves will fade as the gravitational pull of the much larger and more liquid Treasury market is felt by munis.
I’ve looked at different segments of the muni curve, and 10-year munis offer attractive relative value compared to five-year munis. This kind of positioning can be augmented with a mirror image approach in U.S. Treasuries: using futures contracts to favor five-year over 10-year Treasuries. As the two curves move toward one another again, this approach could, in my view, generate attractive potential returns.
2. Not-for-profit hospitals can reward the patient investor.
Health care has historically been a large exposure for many of our tax-exempt bond strategies, with hospital bonds often a favorite. Amid economic growth and Medicaid expansion (which accompanied extra payments for uncompensated care and bad debt), many not-for-profit hospitals have strengthened their balance sheets in the past decade.
Our team of muni investment analysts looks to distinguish between hospitals of similar credit ratings. Often their focus is on regions where health care reimbursement is most favorable. They also regularly talk with hospital executives, as well as with colleagues from our equity and taxable bond investment teams.
In my view, collaboration helps create differentiated investment insights and enables us to get ahead of trends. On that note, the multiyear hospital consolidation wave shows no signs of receding any time soon. Large systems see mergers and acquisitions as a way to stay competitive and diversify. And from the smaller hospital’s perspective, acquisition can represent a lifeline as margins continue to get squeezed.
Each credit must be assessed on its own merits, but it’s fair to say that large multi-state health care systems can be especially attractive. That said, single site hospitals also pique my interest — if they have dominant market share and a high percentage of revenue derived from commercial insurance. Hospital bonds currently account for just under 10% of outstanding investment-grade municipal bonds, and typically offer yields above those of the broader market.
3. Housing munis offer a structural yield advantage.
There are nearly $4 trillion in muni bonds outstanding. In a market of this size, there are likely to be areas that are not as closely researched by investors. Housing is a case in point.
My focus is on single family housing bonds. These munis are issued by various state and local housing authorities across the country, with bond proceeds used to help low-income and first-time buyers purchase their homes. In many cases, the credit story around these bonds has improved: The underlying mortgage pools are either federally insured, or are structured in ways that can reduce the risk of default.
From a valuation standpoint, housing muni bonds offer attractive relative value. For very high-quality credits, it’s not uncommon to see housing munis offer around 0.75% additional yield over similarly rated munis from some other sectors.
As is always the case at Capital, investment decisions center on individual bonds. Bond-by-bond credit research is at the heart of how we invest.

Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index is a market value-weighted index designed to represent the long-term investment-grade tax-exempt bond market.
The index is unmanaged, and results include reinvested dividends and/or distributions but do not reflect the effect of sales charges, commissions, account fees, expenses or U.S. federal income taxes.
The return of principal for bond funds and funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds.

167,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/why-fixed-income.html,Why fixed income? 4 roles your bond portfolio should play,Bonds,"January 23, 2019","This article was originally published on May 23, 2018. It has been updated to reflect market conditions.
With stock markets showing increased volatility in the past year, building resilient and balanced portfolios should be a priority for investors. After all, today’s backdrop of simmering trade tensions, moderating growth and tighter central bank policy all add uncertainty to the outlook. Volatility isn’t going away anytime soon.
With that in mind, now’s a perfect time to revisit the question: Why fixed income? Fixed income serves four key roles in a portfolio: Diversification from equities, capital preservation, income and inflation protection. Many investors would benefit from evaluating whether their bond holdings are meeting these goals.
Capital Group regularly meets with thousands of advisors to evaluate their portfolios and offer our perspectives on potential enhancements. Common problems often surface. Some funds have too much risk embedded in bond allocations. Others develop high correlations to equities due to reaching for yield beyond what may be prudent.
In fact, according to Morningstar’s best-fit index methodology, which uses a quantitative method to determine which index a fund most closely resembles, roughly 88% of the intermediate-term bond category did not behave like a true core fund. Instead, for the three years ended December 31, 2018,   most of these funds behaved more like a credit index, according to Morningstar data.
Style drift like this, in addition to other pitfalls, can be addressed by refocusing on the four roles that fixed income is designed to play in a portfolio.
What goals can fixed income help you pursue in your portfolio?
We believe bonds can serve four central roles in a balanced portfolio. These roles can aid in pursuing retirement goals or simply help stabilize a portfolio to be more resilient when economic shocks hit markets. 
1. Diversification from equities
Your bonds shouldn’t behave like stocks when volatility hits.
If the stock market always rose, then many investors might not bother with bonds. But unfortunately, equity markets often experience volatility and corrections. When this happens, it’s important to have investments within a portfolio that are designed to provide resilience. That is the essence of why investors should seek balanced, diversified portfolios. When one part of a portfolio struggles, another part can pick up the slack. 
Many bond allocations may not be ideally positioned to weather a stock market decline. They hold potential “hidden” risks in the form of high correlations between the fixed income and equity portions of the portfolio. For instance, they may hold funds with an outsized allocation to higher yielding bonds, which historically have had a high correlation to equities and tend to decline in value when stock markets decline. In contrast, fixed income sectors such as Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities have tended to provide good diversification from equities.
For that reason, investors should seek to upgrade their portfolio with funds that provide diversification from equities. These can be good building blocks to help dampen volatility and create durable portfolios. These strategies often have had a low correlation to equities because they invest in higher quality bonds that tend to hold up well when stocks suffer losses. This stability can help enable an investor to rebalance when equities are priced more attractively and to take advantage of market cycles. This approach can help investors achieve long-term investment and savings goals.
2. Capital preservation
A durable portfolio needs a strong foundation.
If equities decline sharply, and a portfolio only contains equities, the portfolio could lose a substantial amount of capital. That’s a particularly serious situation for investors who are nearing retirement, and underscores another important role of fixed income: To help preserve capital.
Unlike equities, high-quality fixed income securities can serve as an all-weather foundation for a portfolio. This advantage can be seen even when looking at medium-term rolling returns for bonds or bond funds with capital preservation as their chief objective.
Although losses can occur over short-term time horizons, history shows that high-quality fixed income investments can offer a measure of stability over time. Historically, they have demonstrated a very strong track record of protecting capital. Short-term periods of losses have tended to be minor in comparison with declines in equities or a bond sector like high yield.
Bonds issued or guaranteed by stable governments or corporations with good business models and solid balance sheets can be key building blocks for a capital preservation strategy. Bonds structured to be backed by strong collateral also can achieve very high quality ratings. Many of these securities have credit ratings at the upper end of the investment-grade spectrum. That said, ratings are only one of many metrics we use to establish the capital preservation aspect of securities. The more risk-averse an investor is, the larger the capital preservation component of their portfolio is likely to be.
3. Income
It’s called fixed income for a reason.
Another way fixed income fundamentally differs from equity is its explicit income component. Although some common and preferred stocks pay dividends, these income streams can fluctuate or disappear at a company’s discretion. Bonds carry more explicit and predictable income streams in the form of coupons, so long as the issuer remains solvent. While the yield will fluctuate with the price, coupons on fixed rate bonds typically do not change.
For this reason, bond funds typically provide some income, with higher yielding bonds generally associated with additional risk. This steady source of investment income can play an important role for many investors, such as retirees who may rely on it for monthly living expenses.
However, years of rock-bottom interest rates have resulted in some style drift by select bond funds that now are holding riskier bonds to augment their yield. This added risk is especially prevalent in some of the top-performing funds, even in categories that traditionally have focused on capital preservation.
While income should be a component of any diversified portfolio, it is prudent to monitor the portion of a fixed income allocation dedicated to higher yielding bonds. Specifically, these holdings should not be regarded as a key source of capital preservation or diversification from equities — they may not perform those roles well.
In a market environment where credit valuations are still arguably high in historical terms, caution is advisable. Investors may potentially take on too much equity-like risk by allowing high-yield corporates to dominate their bond allocations. In a classic 60-40 portfolio, for example, allocating up to a quarter of the 40% fixed income to income might be considered reasonable for some investors. That said, investors should work with their advisors to determine the appropriate allocations for them.
4. Inflation protection
Even modest inflation can erode wealth over time.
Inflation has ebbed and flowed lately. The core Consumer Price Index (CPI) — the inflation measure that strips out volatile food and energy prices — moderated, dropping from 2.4% in mid-2018 to 2.2% in December 2018. A drop in fuel prices also prompted headline inflation to fall.
That said, economic growth and a tight labor market should be supportive of inflation over time. Even if inflation were to remain stuck near the Federal Reserve’s modest 2% target for a decade, that reduces a portfolio’s purchasing power by 18% over those 10 years.
While some investment vehicles can provide indirect protection against inflation, an inflation-linked bond fund can more explicitly preserve purchasing power. This goal can be achieved by owning funds that invest in bonds whose valuations have an explicit link to the CPI, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). The principal value of TIPS adjusts with changes in CPI so that as inflation rises, the principal value increases to preserve purchasing power. Inflation-linked funds can provide more precise protection for purchasing power, especially when inflation is unexpectedly strong.
The bottom line
For long-term investing, balance is key. Investors who seek a balanced portfolio should ensure that their fixed income allocation serves all four roles. Now may be a good time for investors to run a checkup on their fixed income portfolios and consider making the following adjustments:
Upgrade your core bond allocation to help provide elements of all four roles of fixed income — including diversification from equities.
Diversify portfolio income by considering emerging market debt or high-income municipal bonds strategies to complement high-yield corporate bonds.
Look to munis for more than just tax-free income. Municipal bonds can offer attractive after-tax yields for investors in higher income tax brackets, as well as diversification from equities.

168,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/what-fed-rate-hike-means-bond-portfolios.html,The Fed rate hike and what it means for bond portfolios,Monetary Policy,"October 5, 2018","This article was originally published on September 26, 2018. It has been updated to reflect a revised position on duration following a sharp rise in U.S. bond yields. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates again this week — the fourth hike in as many quarters. It came as no shock to professional investors, as the thriving job market and rising inflation prompt the central bank to stay the course on tightening credit. The national unemployment rate has been at or below 4% since April and, over the past few months, the year-over-year Consumer Price Index has been edging up to near 3% for the first time since 2012.
The federal funds target rate is now 25 basis points higher, in a range of 2% to 2.25%. Through the end of 2019, our rates team expects two to three additional rate hikes — roughly in-line with the 2.6 priced into bond markets. Both, however, are fewer than the four increases through 2019 that the Fed currently projects.
Earlier this year, U.S. equities were riled by volatility after a long period of calm. This was partially blamed on the market waking up to the fact that the Fed this time around was intent on reining in monetary policy.
As the central bank continues to soak up money supply, unforeseen knock-on effects could spur fresh bouts of volatility. And that doesn’t even take into account other risks keeping investors up at night, such as messy trade disputes and turmoil in some emerging markets possibly injecting pain into other economies.
These types of concerns led Capital Group’s fixed income Portfolio Strategy Group (PSG) to a view that lofty valuations across several bond sectors warrant prudence. In its fall forum, the group made a few key recommendations on portfolio positioning for our managers:
Be cautious on credit. Debt levels are high and the U.S. economic recovery is in the late stages. That combination makes some corporate bonds look too expensive.
Mortgage-backed securities are looking a little better. The group had been cautious on the mortgage sector for some time, but compared with overpriced corporate bonds they look more attractive.
We still like TIPS. Inflation is up, but we don’t think it has peaked. As consumer prices continue to rise, so too should the value of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. 
Expect a steeper Treasury yield curve. The curve recently had flattened. Under some scenarios, especially in an environment where volatility returns and growth sputters, this trend could change.
What is PSG?
Capital Group’s Portfolio Strategy Group (PSG) forum is a two-day event, taking place a few times a year, which gathers the entire fixed income group across the globe for an in-depth discussion of the macroeconomic environment and fixed income markets. Our proprietary fundamental research is the foundation of the discussions and the basis of any resulting recommendation for our investment professionals. Portfolio managers consider the group’s recommendations to inform investing within their individual portfolio strategies. The following is a recap of views that emerged from the recent meeting in early September.
PSG’s positioning primarily informs core fixed income portfolios. Core portfolios aim to provide diversification from equities, capital preservation and income while striving to generate returns in excess of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index. The goal is to efficiently express their thematic views and avoid stacking risks. That means all positions should not perform well, or poorly, in a single environment.
Outlook and positioning
When 2018 began it looked like all was right in the world. It was known as a “Goldilocks” economy. Fast-forwarding to now, global growth no longer looks quite so synchronized. The U.S. economy appears to be expanding at a decent clip, but prospects look dimmer in Europe, China and emerging markets. This divergence is leading to differing monetary policy paths too. As we saw this week, the Fed is continuing to tighten and that’s beginning to hamper global lending. This partly explains why emerging markets assets have hit a soft patch.
Other potential shocks also loom. Both public and private debt growth in the post-crisis period have ballooned, making financial markets more susceptible to damage when shocks hit. It’s hard to tell how the political winds will shape trade tiffs, so potential implications remain murky. Still, the volatility we saw earlier in the year serves as a sobering reminder: Domestic political agendas such as trade tariffs threaten turbulence for markets.
When it comes to the U.S. economy, growth may remain positive but weaken to more modest levels. Nevertheless, the economy and markets look vulnerable amid continued Fed tightening and late-cycle imbalances such as elevated debt levels. History also provides a not-so-gentle reminder that the last two recessions were spawned not by shifts in the underlying economy, but by shocks in financial markets.
Credit
As the U.S. economy has boomed, corporations have flourished. But as growth begins to wane over the next few years, profit margins will likely get squeezed. Meanwhile, corporate bond values still are hovering near their most expensive level in a decade. Pair that with reasonably solid fundamentals, and determining the value of these bonds becomes a challenge. A scenario in which growth sags, but doesn’t fall into the red, also is quite likely and could keep asset markets on firm footing.
Putting all that together makes us cautious on credit, so we are positioned with less exposure than the index. Having lower exposure to corporate bonds means we also will earn less interest income if the economy keeps roaring. We compensate for this possibility through other exposures.
Duration
Duration had been reduced slightly in the September PSG meeting. However, duration was increased back to neutral relative to the index in October. This adjustment follows a sharp rise in U.S. bond yields and reflects greater uncertainty about the likely path of Fed rate moves in 2019 and beyond. For those not fluent in bond investor jargon, duration is a measure of interest rate risk exposure. We think of our interest rate exposure as a combination of duration and yield curve risk.
Yield curve
We continue to find the five-year part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve the most attractive. This yield curve plots the yield that investors demand at different maturity dates. The yield curve currently is relatively flat, which indicates investors are demanding a relatively small premium for bonds with longer term maturities. 
Since the curve is now so flat, a variety of economic scenarios could lead the curve to steepen from here. That steepening could occur with long-term rates rising more than short-term rates, or short-term rates falling more than long-term rates. The PSG continues to recommend that managers position for a steeper yield curve, which should provide protection in an environment of increased market volatility.
Inflation
As an economic cycle progresses towards the end of its expansionary period, you can expect to see a few trends. One is that the unemployment rate dips very low as lots of new jobs bubble up. Competition for workers tends to result in rising wage growth, which in turn leads to expectations for higher inflation. Indeed, we’ve seen inflation tick up in recent quarters and consumer prices look likely to rise further.
This trend has led the TIPS breakeven rate, the inflation rate at which TIPS returns equal nominal Treasury returns, to increase. However, breakeven increases have lagged the rise in actual inflation. As a result, we find TIPS attractive. Under several scenarios, TIPS also are likely to fare better than U.S. corporate bonds, and may also serve as a hedge to our yield curve positioning.
Mortgages
Spreads for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to Treasuries, the differences between how much these securities yield, are narrow but stable. Although that indicates MBS are somewhat expensive, the risks facing the mortgage sector look potentially less impactful than the risks facing corporate credit.
In our view, mortgage-backed securities offer a lower volatility way to increase portfolio yield and returns in an environment of positive, but slower, economic growth. As a result, we have moved from recommending less exposure to U.S. mortgage-backed securities than the index to a neutral position.

Higher U.S. bond yields, a stronger dollar and country-specific risks have fueled volatility in emerging markets bonds.
Fundamentals for emerging markets remain favorable overall.
Global growth, firmer commodity prices and deeper local bond markets should help provide resilience.
The selloff has created potentially attractive entry points for selective investors.
Is a crisis brewing, or is this an overdue market correction? That’s the big question confronting investors in emerging markets debt in mid-2018. For me, what we’re experiencing feels more like a rough patch. 
Dollar-denominated bonds, as measured by the J.P. Morgan EMBI Global Index, are down approximately 5% year to date; local currency debt, as measured by the J.P. Morgan GBI-EM Diversified Index, is off 4% in dollar terms through June 11. But these market moves are on the heels of double-digit gains in 2017.
What’s behind the selloff?
The selloff seemed to be sparked by a couple of related developments. U.S. Treasury yields climbing to 3% and a bout of dollar strength dimmed the appeal of certain emerging markets currencies and bonds.
Confidence in the asset class may have taken a hit lately, but the market has actually done a good job of pinpointing country-specific vulnerabilities. In the cases of Argentina and Turkey, for example, higher bond yields seem justified. Both countries face elevated levels of short-term debt, inflationary pressures and expensive currencies relative to the dollar, as well as governments who are unwilling to take measures to address these issues in the longer term. 
Why I remain cautiously optimistic
So far, Argentina, Turkey and Brazil have been among the hardest hit. The possibility that negative sentiment may spread to other emerging markets can’t be ignored. With that in mind, a degree of caution is warranted in the near term.
Escalating trade tensions, U.S. midterms, dollar strength and presidential elections in Mexico and Brazil, are among the possible sources of volatility that I’m keeping an eye on. The European Central Bank is likely to soon announce the end of its bond-buying program, and that could also be impactful. And yet, as a selective investor, I continue to find plenty of reasons to remain constructive:
Fundamentals for a number of developing economies remain favorable.
Vulnerabilities to political risks or higher U.S. interest rates may not be as widespread as is sometimes assumed; better debt structures should allow them to withstand higher yields.
Synchronized global growth, albeit at a more moderate pace than last year, should be broadly supportive.
Commodities prices are stable and appear reasonably valued.
Policymaking by central banks in many developing nations is closely tied to growth and inflation in those respective domestic economies.
Debt levels generally aren’t alarming and, in some cases, debt burdens are substantially lower than in major developed nations.
What’s more, rising rates in the U.S. don’t necessarily have to result in a selloff in emerging markets debt. The key thing is that as long as they rise with what the market is expecting and what the U.S. Federal Reserve is communicating, I don’t think there will be an issue for emerging markets debt. Balanced growth in emerging markets is a much more supportive phenomenon.
In the past, emerging markets debt was primarily dollar-denominated; so when U.S. rates rose there was often a rush for the exits in emerging markets bonds. But since local currency markets have grown in recent years, that pattern may not repeat.
Modest preference for local currency bonds
As a portfolio manager for American Funds Emerging Markets Bond Fund®, I remain diversified across the entire emerging markets bond universe.
Modestly greater emphasis on local currency bonds seems appropriate to me in the current environment. In terms of the yield curve, I’m balancing exposure to higher yielding local sovereign bonds with maturities of less than five years with investments in longer maturity bonds from investment-grade countries.
I’m mostly favoring government bonds issued by countries offering a combination of positive growth prospects and political stability (or diminishing political risks). I also prefer to be invested in markets where central bank policy is clear and more driven by domestic economic factors rather than external forces.
India, South Africa, Mexico and several African nations are among the markets offering attractive opportunities at present. Recent volatility has, in some instances, had a silver lining: lifting return potential in a number of markets where fundamentals remain just as solid as they were before the market jitters began.
With U.S. high-yield markets at their tightest spreads in more than a decade, emerging markets debt could be an attractive alternative for investors to consider: The asset class has offered comparable income with modestly better equity diversification potential.

172,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/muni-rule-changes.html,Investing in individual munis? A new disclosure rule shakes things up,Municipal Bonds,"May 3, 2018","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
New regulations will lend additional transparency to retail municipal bond trading.
The trend of advisors transitioning client assets from individual municipal bonds to more flexible muni strategies may accelerate.
This could bring additional benefits, if advisors opt for managers with both scale and an emphasis on research-driven investing.
New rule for greater transparency
Do you allocate to municipals via individual bonds? If so, a new bond disclosure rule set by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) could be a game changer. Approved by the SEC last year and set to go into effect on May 14, this change will affect an estimated 8,000 retail investor muni bond transactions every day.
The new MSRB markup disclosure rule has two major parts. First, it will require retail bond brokerage firms to disclose the amount of their “markup,” or how much profit they are making on each trade. This is only the case for transactions that are bought and sold by the broker dealer on the same day, and only for retail clients.
Second, all client trade confirmations will feature a link to trade price data about the bond on the MSRB’s Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA®) website. With minimal effort, clients will be able to look at the price they paid (or received) versus the recent trading history for that same bond.
Why all the fuss?
First off, this rule will apply to most bonds traded with investment advisors, stock brokers or individual retail clients. But the new rule will have the greatest impact on municipal bonds, where a lack of transparency has historically led to relatively high transaction costs for individual buyers.
Overall, the municipal market is a very different place than it was a decade ago. Bond insurers have left the marketplace, creating the necessity for teams of experienced investment analysts to ascertain credit risk and relative value. The breadth of the market is extremely large as well: The Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index includes more than 50,000 separate issues.
It's safe to say that the new rule could potentially be a catalyst for some uncomfortable client conversations. Rather than letting the headlines dictate the discussion, we believe advisors should take a proactive approach and initiate the dialog with a solution already in place. 
While not all clients need ot transition away from advisor-managed muni sleeves, there will likely be many cases when enlisting a third-party manager is prudent.
Flexible muni strategies can open the door to other benefits.
Tax-advantaged mutual funds and separately managed accounts (SMAs) can offer investors a relatively liquid and diversified way to invest in the asset class. For example, investors in Capital Group’s range of muni strategies can potentially benefit from:
Deep research: With munis now much more of a credit-driven market, fundamental research is a crucial aspect of understanding risk-adjusted return potential.
Institutional access: Managers with scale can access new issues, as well as competitive pricing in the secondary market.
Liquidity: Funds and SMAs offer a relatively liquid investment option, compared to individual muni bonds.
Duration and curve management: Strategies that manage interest rate exposure can potentially add value in different bond market environments.
The time for proactive client conversations is now.
The new disclosure rule is sure to spark many discussions about advisor-managed municipal bonds
Ultimately, greater transparency should benefit all by shedding light on costs. It should also provide greater context for those advisors who are considering transitioning client assets from individual municipal bonds to more flexible muni strategies such as The Tax-Exempt Bond Fund of America® or Capital Group Intermediate Municipal℠ SMA.

173,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/3-views-treasury-yield.html,10-year Treasury yields: 3 views on 3%,Bonds,"May 2, 2018","The 10-year Treasury yield topped 3% last week after rising steadily since the beginning of the year. How much can bond yields rise and what are the implications for stocks? Three of our portfolio managers provide their views.
Gradual rate hikes to continue as inflation poised to pick up.
Ritchie Tuazon
Portfolio manager, Strategic Bond Fund, Inflation Linked Bond Fund
Bond yields have moved higher as inflation has risen. Commodities broadly, and especially gasoline prices, have risen meaningfully in recent months.
More importantly, wages have risen and will feed into inflation. There is a debate in the market as to whether the traditional relationship between wages and inflation, also known as the Phillips curve, is not as strong as it used to be. I think sooner or later, tighter wages will feed into inflation.
Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, could touch 3% in the middle of this year and then drift lower at the end of the year. Core inflation, which is the measure that strips out volatile energy and food prices, could be up 2.6% by the end of 2018.  
It is worth remembering that we are in the later phases of this economic cycle. And the Federal Reserve is not only raising interest rates, it is also removing money from the system through quantitative tightening. Given a tightening of financial conditions, there's certainly a reasonable chance that financial markets could wobble.
So the Fed will watch and calibrate its rate cycle based the impact of its actions and other factors on markets and the broader economy. There could be up to three further hikes this year, though two hikes would also be reasonable. If there is one word that summarizes the Fed’s approach, it’s “gradual.”
In this environment, I don’t expect 10-year Treasury yields to move a lot higher in any sustained way. A range of approximately 2.75% to 3.25% for the remainder of 2018 appears reasonable. And within that, higher than 3% may be more likely than lower than 3%, in part due to increased Treasury supply to fund the larger deficits. 
Rising interest rates can be good for stocks.
Jim Lovelace
Portfolio manager, Capital Income Builder
Although the conventional wisdom is that interest rate increases are bad for stocks, the relationship really depends on the reason that rates are moving higher. If rates are going up because the economy is healthy, then we can be in a period when both interest rates and stocks can go up.
For me, reaching 3% is a significant moment in that it means the economy has fully recovered from the financial crisis and is healthy. We have gone from an extremely low level of interest rates to what will be a more normal level of 3% to 4% yields. And that’s probably good for equity valuations.
The real debate is: when does that change? When do rising interest rates reflect an overheated economy? I don’t think we are there yet, as inflation remains modest and rates are rising from a pretty low level.
Similarly, it’s not always the case that rising rates are bad for dividend-paying stocks. The dividend-paying universe of stocks has evolved and electric utilities are among the few areas that still have a tight relationship to bond yields. The telecommunications companies don’t trade in line with rates as much as utilities do, and consumer products companies hardly trade with interest rates at all. On the other hand, financials, and especially banks, benefit from rising rates.
We may continue to see sharp market moves for a period of time as the benchmark 10-year yield touches key levels — 3% or 3.25%. But these can be driven by program trades or large positions from select market participants getting flushed out. The trends that impact markets long-term — the gravitational pulls — are generally more subtle and not captured in one-day moves, but occur over a number of months.
I am less concerned about the impact of rising rates on markets than the possibility of trade wars and the impact it may have on the economy and market sentiment. As a portfolio manager in a multi-asset fund, Capital Income Builder, we reduced the equity exposure in favor of fixed income over the last year, albeit from historically high levels of equity in the fund.
The equity risk premium has declined as rates have risen. It is stocks' earnings yield minus the Treasury yield.
Emerging markets bonds could hold their own.
Rob Neithart
Portfolio manager, Emerging Markets Bond Fund, World Bond Fund
From a global perspective, as bond yields continue to rise in the U.S., it becomes increasingly attractive versus other developed markets. Higher relative rates should also be supportive for the dollar in the near-term. From the perspective of valuations, however, a stable to weaker dollar seems more likely over time. 
For emerging markets, rising U.S. interest rates have historically had a negative impact. But emerging markets economies have undergone profound changes in the past two decades.
Economic and monetary cycles are much less tied to the U.S. It’s no longer the case that they have to raise interest rates when the U.S. does. Also, many markets have well-developed local bond markets with a local investor base, even though that base may not be as deep as in some developed markets.
Many economies in the emerging markets are at the early or middle stages of their economic growth cycle, and that has a momentum of its own. Overall, they’re well positioned to handle modestly higher U.S. yields. There’s still decent return potential in emerging markets debt, even after the strong rally of the past year or so.

In between each of the last five recessions, the spread between 10- and 2-year Treasury yields has been negative, a proxy for an inverted curve. But even if evidence supports this trend, it is not an indicator of timing. Over the last five cycles, the start of a recession has ranged from 10 to 24 months following the first month of a negatively sloped yield curve.
The U.S. curve has flattened in recent years and will likely be inverted at some point. That trend could point to the U.S. being in the late cycle of its current expansion, but not necessarily at the end. Investors should consider this potentially bearish signal as just one data point within a bigger picture, while many positive signs remain. In fact, the global outlook remains relatively bright as most economies continue to expand.

The net impact of reduced monetary accommodation and rising fiscal stimulus is leading to a period of higher volatility.
Inflation has been modest in recent years but may increase as resource utilization rises.
Tight credit spreads imply asymmetric downside risk, even amid economic expansion.
We continue to be in a Goldilocks period for the global economy. Growth across most regions is running modestly above trend, while inflation is gradually moving higher but remains tame. However, this equilibrium is at the risk of being disrupted as central banks around the world begin to tighten monetary policy while U.S. lawmakers move forward with a strong dose of fiscal stimulus via tax cuts.
Capital Group’s Portfolio Strategy Group Forum (PSG) takes place three times each year. The two-day event brings together the entire fixed income group from across the globe for an in-depth discussion on the macroeconomic environment and fixed income markets. Our proprietary fundamental research is the foundation of the discussions and any recommendations for our investment professionals that result from these meetings. This is a recap of views that emerged from the recent meeting in late February.
Outlook and positioning
The economic backdrop looks positive. U.S. growth is expected to be above 2.5% in 2018 with momentum likely through 2019. In Europe, economic expansion is broadening beyond the core economies and should remain around 2% over the next two years. Meanwhile, China should be able to sustain a growth rate above 6% in 2018 but will likely slow next year as the government implements more aggressive economic and credit reforms.
Thus far, the uptick in global growth has left core inflation below central bank targets. However, years of modest but steady growth have begun to push resource utilization rates higher, which should put upward pressure on prices. Recent weakening of the U.S. dollar and rising shelter costs, a major component of the Consumer Price Index, are also lifting inflation.
Tax reform and the proposed budget, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the Bipartisan Budget Act respectively, are likely to push the U.S. economy further away from equilibrium and increase fiscal deficits. Lower corporate tax rates should boost capital expenditures and put some upward pressure on resource utilization. Yet it is not clear that this will lead to higher productivity.
Central bank policy  has already begun shifting in the U.S. and will begin shifting in Europe in 2018. Quantitative easing, or QE, in the U.S. is shifting to quantitative tightening. Asset purchases by the European Central Bank are expected to slow in the third quarter. As monetary policy tightens, we are seeing a rise in market volatility.
Our portfolio positioning recommendation to managers seeks to outpace the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index in a more uncertain world of higher market volatility. It aims to accomplish this while giving up very little yield relative to the index. Core interest rate positioning – both duration and curve positioning – seeks to balance potential market outcomes and the path of rates that is already priced into forward markets.
Credit
Although the economic backdrop remains constructive, the extended period of low interest rates has encouraged corporations to increase leverage and investors to reach for yield. The risk for both investment-grade and high-yield credit is asymmetric at this point in the cycle with limited room for spread tightening and high potential for more volatility and spread widening. While default rates in high yield are not expected to rise significantly in the next year, companies will need to begin addressing their debt structures ahead of the next recession. As a result, we favor an underweight position in credit.
Duration
Duration positioning is driven by a number of factors, including the current shape of the spot and forward yield curves, our outlook for economic conditions and anticipated central bank policy. While economic growth is improving and central banks are beginning to react, they may not move quickly enough in an environment of persistent cyclical strength. In this scenario, yields are likely to move higher than is anticipated by the forward curve. Thus, core bond portfolios should be modestly short duration, but positioned for a steepening yield curve.
Yield curve
In the last 12 months, there has been a significant flattening of the U.S. yield curve as investors have anticipated continued tightening by the Federal Reserve. As a result, the five-year part of the U.S. yield curve is relatively attractive. While further yield curve flattening could occur, much of this is discounted in the forward markets already. Increasing issuance of U.S. Treasury bonds combined with Fed tightening could also put pressure on longer dated maturities. Thus, managers should position portfolios for yield curve steepening by being long the five-year part of the curve and underweight 10-year and 30-year bonds.
Inflation
Although breakeven inflation rates have moved higher, the risks are still to the upside in the U.S. as resource utilization increases with core inflation potentially reaching 2.5%. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are also likely to offset the core bond credit position in an environment where credit continues to rally. Core bond portfolios should be overweight U.S. TIPS.
Mortgages
Mortgage spreads remain tight with primary rate volatility still low. Spreads have little room to tighten further. The Fed will begin to increase the pace of its quantitative tightening in the second quarter of 2018, which will put upward pressure on supply. Therefore, core bond portfolios should have a less-than-index position in mortgages.

Inflation and interest rates continue to drive market sentiment.
There should be sufficient slack in the labor market to contain wage growth.
Long-term bond yields should remain range-bound even as they adjust higher.
Rate market volatility to remain above recent multi-year lows as major central banks tighten monetary policy worldwide.
As a fixed income investment analyst at Capital Group, Tom Hollenberg has research responsibility for interest rates. He explains why interest rates should remain range-bound, despite rising inflation and tightening by central banks.
Concerns about a rise in inflation and interest rates are driving investor sentiment and market volatility. What are your thoughts?
There is no doubt that inflation has turned around pretty remarkably since its period of mid-2017 weakness. We learned on Wednesday that in January the core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.3% month-over-month, which was above expectations. This provides further evidence that we will continue to see a gradual firming of inflation. I expect the core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index — the Fed’s favored measure that excludes food and energy prices and which generally runs 30 to 40 basis points below CPI — to rise to nearly 2% this year. That should give the Fed the backdrop it needs to hike rates three times over 2018, assuming other factors don’t derail employment or growth.
The January CPI number was boosted by rising prices of some components such as apparel, furniture, and used cars. But it is inflation in the services area that bears watching, as that tends to reflect any tightness in the labor market. On top of continued strength in shelter inflation, Wednesday’s report showed broad-based price pressure in many services components, such as medical care.
A pickup in average hourly earnings was a factor that set off the sharp decline in stocks earlier this month, as investors worry about how this will feed into inflation. Do you see this as a concern?
We have what some would call a white-hot labor market with very low unemployment. But I think there is still some slack in the labor market. As wages go up — particularly for entry-level occupations — you may see more people who have been on the sidelines start to look for employment. We are already seeing that happen. Therefore, I don’t think you will get a step function higher in wages. And it’s part of the reason we have not seen a spike in wages even though we currently have a 4.1% unemployment rate.
The labor market participation rate is still low on a historical basis. A large portion of this can be explained by secular factors, such as demographics or the opioid crisis. But there is still a cohort of marginally attached workers to the economy who could potentially reenter the labor force given the right incentives. The bottom decile of wage earners has seen a near 5% growth in pay over the past year — much more than top earners in percentage terms. That implies that lower skilled labor, which may be able to enter the market more readily, can soak up new entry-level jobs.
If the economy continues to grow around a 2.3% annualized GDP growth rate, wages should continue to move higher, but at a gradual pace. This would be consistent with a gradual rise in core inflation. Finally, increased investment and automation — think self-serve kiosks in retail stores as one example — can act as a buffer against higher wage costs and their pass-through effect on higher inflation.
We have seen a firming up of economic activity and inflation not just in the U.S., but globally. What does this mean for monetary policy?
We are seeing central banks become less accommodative worldwide. As recently as two years ago, it seemed that only the Federal Reserve was taking decisive tightening action. This began in December 2015 with its first rate hike in nearly a decade. After three subsequent rate increases, in October 2017 it began cutting its asset repurchases on maturing securities, effectively shrinking its balance sheet.
In the latter part of 2017 and in 2018, we’ve seen other central banks come forward. The European Central Bank has announced that it will cut its quantitative easing program in half this year. More recent communication from ECB officials hints that the program could end entirely in September or December, and that a rate hike could follow as soon as a matter of months after purchases end. Because the ECB’s quantitative easing program has served as such a prominent buyer of European debt, its absence could have a significant effect on both Euro and global yields.
A part of the ECB’s bullishness comes not only from better growth prospects, but also from stronger inflation expectations. New collective bargaining agreements are helping to push wages up in countries like Germany. And while the Fed’s dual mandate requires it to base U.S. monetary policy on both inflation and unemployment, the ECB policy is based solely on its inflation target. Furthermore, the ECB has a target of below, but close to, 2% — unlike the Fed’s symmetric 2% inflation target.
Across the English Channel, the Bank of England cut rates in August 2016 following the U.K. referendum decision to exit the European Union. Yet, as it became clearer over the following year that the U.K. economy had performed much better than initial consensus expectations, the Bank of England reversed its cut by hiking rates last November. In its most recent meeting this month, policymakers struck an upbeat tone on inflation, which is pushing markets to expect more rate hikes.
Should this tightening of monetary policy — via both rates and a shrinking of central bank balance sheets — result in higher interest rates? Both short-term rates and long-term rates?
As we see a gradual winding down of this period of experimental monetary policy, global yields are beginning to rise. In the U.S., where yields are the highest among major developed markets, rates have increased due to a number of factors beyond the Fed’s influence. Part of the reason for higher longer term yields stems from a rising term premium, which is the additional compensation that investors demand for holding bonds for a longer period of time. I would say we are seeing a re-pricing of term premium rather than expectations of higher interest rates in the short run. Global central banks could be having a significant effect as well, as tighter financial conditions across the world lead to higher rates abroad — which, in our interconnected markets, could spell higher rates in the U.S.
My base case is that short-term rates, including the two-year yield, should rise gradually, absent a major shock to the financial system. That said, given my expectations for modest rises in pay and inflation, I see the 10-year bond yield remaining range-bound, probably around 3% in the near term, unless global growth and inflation appear to be accelerating at an even more rapid pace than currently anticipated. That is still quite low on a historical basis and should continue to support economic growth. Over the longer term, the picture for 10-year yields is less clear. They could rise as Treasury supply rises with bigger deficits from tax cuts and increased spending in Washington. Yields could also fall if the strength of our late-cycle economic expansion begins to fade, or even if we enter a period of relative calm. A number of fixed income buyers — think pension managers, life insurers, and wealth funds — may view higher yields as an opportunity to add to their portfolios.
Against this backdrop, should we expect market volatility to remain elevated?
Yes. Although the gradual unwinding of the Fed’s balance sheet has gone relatively smoothly, we are still in a period where central banks around the world have begun unwinding extremely loose monetary policies, resulting in tighter financial conditions. So market volatility rising from its extremely low levels shouldn’t be surprising. The CBOE’s Volatility Index (VIX) in early January was under 10. That’s remarkably low compared to its historical level of 19 since 1990.
While the levels of 30 and above seen in recent weeks might be at the high end of their long-term range, something closer to their historical average is probably warranted. And since U.S. interest rates are edging higher, it is no surprise that we are seeing greater volatility in equities as well. Moving away from extraordinarily loose financial conditions globally means that volatility loses a key dampener.
What can investors do to protect purchasing power as inflation begins rising to higher rates than we’ve seen in recent years?
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities provide a good, explicit hedge against rising inflation. They’re pegged against CPI and high-quality government securities. Having a portion of your portfolio’s fixed income allocation in bond funds like our American Funds Inflation Linked Bond Fund® can help to protect you from rising prices.

Prospects for higher U.S. inflation appear well supported.
Yield-chasing bond strategies can leave investors more vulnerable to further selloffs in equities.
Investors should seek to upgrade their portfolios.
Mike Gitlin, head of fixed income at Capital Group, has 24 years of investment industry experience. He discusses the current market environment and what it means for bond investors.
Volatility appears to have been sparked by concern that much higher bond yields are on the horizon. What’s your take?
The turning tide of global central bank monetary policy has, in my view, played a critical role. Developed market central banks were incredibly accommodative for nearly a decade, providing a tailwind to asset prices.
Now, policy is tightening. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates five times since December 2015, and is shrinking its balance sheet. The Bank of England hiked for the first time in a decade in November 2017. The Bank of Canada has raised rates three times since July 2017, and the European Central Bank is committed to reducing asset purchases.
“Don’t bet against the Fed,” goes the old adage. How much of a headwind will assets face amid less supportive policy? That’s the big question that is buffeting markets, and we’re considering it carefully.
Certainly volatility can feel unsettling, so it’s doubly important for investors to keep things in perspective. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was 2.85% as of February 8, 2018. This is less than a quarter percentage point higher than the level a year earlier. And a year from now, the yield could be another quarter of a percentage point higher, according to forward markets — hardly a dramatic move.
Higher longer term bond yields have often signaled a coming upturn in inflation. What’s your outlook for U.S. inflation? 
Our interest rates team thinks core inflation could reach 2.4% in 2018 — if solid wage gains continue. Productivity growth was -0.1% for the fourth quarter of 2017. If productivity remains anemic, increased labor costs will need to be borne by companies and consumers.
We are also monitoring unemployment. Analysis by our economists suggests falling unemployment could also feed through into core inflation. A decline in the unemployment rate from 4.1% to 3.5%, for instance, could push annualized wage growth a quarter of a percentage point higher.
You’ve recently talked about the need for investors to also be mindful of credit risk in the current environment — why is that?
Credit markets are, according to various measures, somewhere between fair value and full value, and certainly not cheap. Investor demand has pushed down yields on corporate bonds. Their yield gaps (or, spreads) to Treasuries have approached record tight levels.
Fundamentals for the companies issuing these bonds remain broadly supportive. Even so, it wouldn’t be surprising to see credit spreads widen back out from here.
The hunt for yield has led some bond strategies to increase their investments in credit, including high-yield corporates. This could pose a particular challenge right now because high yield tends to be highly correlated with equities. Put differently, some core bond strategies may not provide the diversification from equities that investors expect. That could be a problem.
How widespread is scope creep among bond strategies?
Many bond funds appear to have strayed from their original missions in the low-interest-rate environment of the past decade.
To dig deeper, we conducted our own simple study centered on Morningstar’s short-term bond category.  This is a category that should be all about capital preservation and diversification from equities.
We focused on funds that notched top-quartile annualized returns for the three years ended December 31, 2017. We found that the majority of funds that fared exceptionally well had also taken significant risks.
Indeed, many seemed to behave more like credit funds, not the kind of conservative fund that a retiree might choose as a reasonable yield enhancement over money market funds.
So, some bond strategies have been overly focused on finding yield, what should investors be looking to achieve with their fixed income?
Many bond funds may be taking more risk than their clients are aware of. It’s important that investors refocus on the four primary roles of fixed income in a balanced portfolio: diversification from equities, income, inflation protection and capital preservation.
That is exactly how we use fixed income in our target date funds, and it’s how we think advisors should think about bond portfolios for their clients. For most investors, maintaining a long-term perspective is a critical step towards achieving their goals. This means maintaining an appropriate balance of equities and fixed income through volatile periods.
That said, the current pullback may present a great opportunity for investors to upgrade their bond portfolios to what we refer to as true core: that means reallocating to bond funds that offer the potential for both solid income and diversification from equities.

180,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/derisk-core-bond-allocation.html,Is now the time to de-risk your core bond allocation?,Asset Allocation,"February 7, 2018","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
When equities decline, owning true core bonds is vital.
High yield and other credit is strongly correlated to stocks.
Beware of bond funds reliant on credit when volatility strikes.
U.S. equities have seen steep declines in recent weeks following all-time highs, ending a period of exceptionally low market volatility with credit markets near historic low levels in yields and spreads. In such an environment, investors who have taken a disciplined approach to portfolio construction and who have treated their bond allocation as the safer part of their overall allocation – one that provides some protection when equities sell off – are likely to have fared better. They would have reduced higher yielding investments and waited for a good re-entry point to the sector.
As equity markets experience a sharp decline, a true core bond fund with low-risk exposure should have avoided such a decline. This enables an investor to preserve capital and allows for a rebalancing opportunity by selling a bond fund and then buying equities during the stock downturn.
Risk markets are near highs in price.
Since the end of the financial crisis, investors have experienced very strong returns from U.S. equity markets. Starting in 2009, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index has had nine years of strong, positive returns averaging nearly 16% annually through 2017. February marks the current economic expansion’s 104th month, which had been helping stock markets to thrive. And while there may be room for this equity bull market to continue despite recent volatility, on average, expansions have historically only lasted about 60 months.
This upward trend continued as 2018 began. Although some investors and analysts said that the pace of returns and the level of equity markets concerned them, only recently have stocks experienced turmoil in the face of risks, such as:
Potential changes in monetary policy accommodation from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan
Uncertainty surrounding fiscal policy in Washington
Increased geopolitical unrest
High-yield bonds delivered solid results in the risk-on environment. Annualized returns for the U.S. high-yield market have averaged nearly 14% during the nine-year period from 2009 to 2017. However, at the end of 2017, the average yield for the U.S. high-yield market had fallen to below 5.7% and credit spreads tightened to 343 basis points above Treasuries.
In this environment, investors stretched for yield by moving down the credit-quality spectrum, increasing holdings in issuers rated CCC and below. As strong demand has continued, we are now starting to see covenant protections for bondholders being diluted or removed from indenture documents. As a result, investor protection has diminished materially. Investors appear to be accepting more covenant risk for even less compensation as they stretch for yield at precisely the wrong time.
Lastly, yields in the investment-grade corporate bond market have fallen as well. In 2007, just before the financial crisis, investment-grade credit spreads tightened to approximately 85 basis points above Treasuries. By the end of 2017, credit spreads for high-quality issuers were approaching 90 basis points, and the yield on single-A-rated corporate bonds maturing in 10 years was nearing 3.3%, depending on the issuer. However, the yield in June of 2007 was approximately 6% for similar issuers and maturities. Current yields seem low, especially since balance sheets are weaker, having been levered up to 2007 levels. Credit quality is only marginally better than in 2007, but debt service costs are lower due to reduced coupon payments.
Know how a bond fund is invested and its associated equity correlation risk.
As investors reach for yield, many have allocated a large portion of their fixed income assets to the categories labeled “strategic income,” “multisector” or “nontraditional” fixed income. In general, these strategies have performed well in recent years by having significant allocations to the U.S. high-yield and investment-grade corporate bond sectors.
With these two fixed income sectors seemingly fully priced and near historic lows in yields and spreads, “income” or “high-yielding” strategies could be at risk of either fundamental spread widening or sharp price declines due to their often surprisingly high correlation to U.S. equity markets in a risk-off environment. Funds in Morningstar’s Multisector Bond category at the end of 2017’s third quarter had an average of 36% of investments allocated to the high-yield sector, resulting in a correlation to equities of 0.63 over the past three years (the closer an investment’s correlation to equities is to one, the more correlated it is to equities).
When an equity correction or other risk-off event occurs, such as the one we’ve recently seen, fixed income funds highly correlated to stocks could experience steep losses. Over such periods, a true core bond fund, like the Bond Fund of America® (BFA), strived to provide income while maintaining a low correlation to U.S. equity markets. This enables investors to rebalance back into equities and maintain their asset allocation discipline.

181,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/munis-post-tax-reform.html,Municipal bonds in a post-tax reform world: Keep calm and own munis,Municipal Bonds,"January 11, 2018","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
The new tax law is unlikely to spell trouble for the municipal bond market.
The income and diversification potential of munis remains compelling.
In-state bonds may shine brighter for residents of California, New York and other high-tax states.
The storm before the calm?
What a difference a month makes. Late last year, municipal bond prices declined as new issues flooded the market. Uncertainty around tax reform and the potential for the municipal exemption to be scaled back for non-profit bond issuers such as universities and hospitals had unsettled the market.
Early versions of tax reform legislation proposed wide-ranging changes. Some of the measures considered could have greatly affected both supply (in terms of which entities could issue tax-exempt bonds) and demand — due to changes in marginal tax rates for investors.
Fast forward to the present — municipal bonds have recovered some lost ground, and markets have mostly been calmer. As anticipated, tax reform has reduced various federal tax rates, especially for corporations. The most significant potential changes to the types of issuers that can benefit from the exemption did not make it into the final bill.
Critically, the tax exemption of interest earned from municipal bonds was untouched. Even so, one question looms large: Has tax reform changed the big picture for investors in municipals? On balance, I don’t believe so.
Overall, my near-term outlook has not radically changed in the wake of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For tax-aware investors, the bottom line is that higher quality municipals remain a compelling option for core fixed income allocations in 2018. Here’s why:
1. Reduced demand from investors is unlikely to be a large negative factor.
One concern voiced by some market commentators is that reduced demand for municipal bonds from investors will put downward pressure on bond prices in 2018. With reduced tax rates, the argument goes, lower after-tax yields will undercut the appeal of munis. 
I’m unconvinced that the impact will be as significant as some have argued. Individuals in the highest federal income tax bracket will get a modestly smaller tax advantage from holding municipals rather than other high-quality taxable bonds, as the top marginal rate dropped from 39.6% to 37%.
Banks and insurance companies have historically been important participants in the municipal market. For them, the cut in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% does substantially reduce the tax advantage of holding municipals. While the lower rate may reduce demand on the margin, our research suggests that the new tax legislation is unlikely to turn these entities into outright sellers.
For corporations — as well as many other investors — yield is only part of the appeal of municipal bonds. 
2. Municipals still offer true core portfolio benefits — even after tax reform.
The after-tax income potential of municipals outshines comparable taxable bonds — even after factoring in a lower effective top individual income tax rate. At recent market levels, the reduced tax advantage in 2018 (compared with 2017) equates to a taxable-equivalent yield for municipals that is about 0.2 percentage points lower.
Diversification is another key reason to invest in municipal bonds. The municipal market’s history of relatively low correlation to equities certainly checks that box. For tax-aware investors who are seeking a true core fixed income allocation, municipals are still well worth considering.
3. In-state bonds may shine brighter for investors in high income-tax states.
Tax reform has reduced the state and local tax deduction for many taxpayers. While this change may leave some individuals in high-tax states feeling the pinch, it’s a development that could in the near term be favorable for municipal bonds issued in states with high income taxes.
In New York and California, for instance, the doubly tax-exempt nature of in-state bonds may become more highly prized by residents in higher income tax brackets. It’s far from conclusive, but recent yield moves have been consistent with this kind of change in demand.
My thoughts on the year ahead
Municipal bonds rallied substantially in 2017, and investors should expect more muted absolute returns in 2018.
Amid elevated valuations, putting greater emphasis on higher quality bonds seems appropriate. This kind of thinking has been reflected in the recent portfolio positioning of The Tax-Exempt Bond Fund of America®. (I’m a portfolio manager for this fund, one of our core tax-exempt fixed income strategies.)
At current municipal bond valuations, a rise in Treasury yields — perhaps in response to interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve — could be a headwind for near-term municipal returns.
Policy developments may also present challenges in 2018. The repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate is a recent example. Our investment analysts are carefully considering how this development may affect different issuers and create both risks and opportunities over time; historically, health care has been a large sector exposure for many of our tax-exempt bond funds.
Any renewed volatility — prompted by the Trump administration’s policy efforts regarding infrastructure or health care, for example — could present attractive buying opportunities for investors with a long-term perspective.
I also remain excited about some enduring themes reflected in The Tax-Exempt Bond Fund of America’s portfolio. Our focus on revenue bond issuers in sectors such as transportation, public power, housing and education offer ways to invest around the pension and other long-term liability issues confronting state and local governments.
Not-for-profit hospitals are another great example of an enduring theme. Even in an uncertain health care sector, we have found favorable return potential amid a wave of consolidation. Across issuers, sectors and regions, I expect our emphasis on bond-by-bond research will continue to uncover compelling risk-adjusted relative value opportunities.

Low quality intermediate bond funds have been strong.
But these funds have relatively high equity correlations.
This may amplify total portfolio losses when stocks plunge.
This group hasn’t outpaced high quality peers longer term.
With credit spreads tight, diversifying equities is vital. 
Investors have traditionally considered fixed income to be the stable part of their asset allocation, emphasizing high-quality government and investment-grade bonds. But as interest rates fell steadily in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, many investors turned to funds emphasizing lower quality investment-grade corporate (BBB/Baa and above) and high-yield (BB/Ba and below) bonds in order to boost income. While these strategies provide higher yields and have delivered attractive returns in recent years, they also generally move in greater lockstep with equity markets.
So how should investors balance these competing objectives of income and diversification? And more generally, what is the appropriate role of bonds in a client’s portfolio?
Historical data provides some context. For our analysis here, we have sorted the universe of funds in the Morningstar Intermediate Bond Category into four equal quartiles, which are rebalanced monthly based on trailing three-year correlation with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index. The top quartile also includes the highest quality bond funds with an average correlation of -0.05 to equities and less than 3% invested in high-yield bonds. In contrast, the fourth quartile includes the lowest quality bond funds with an average equity correlation of 0.42 and almost 12% in non-investment grade bonds.
The results for low-credit-quality intermediate bond funds (Quartile 4) have been quite impressive since the financial crisis. These highest quartile funds (Quartile 4) have outperformed the first- and second-quartile funds by an average of 2.6% and 1.6% (annualized) respectively, from 2009 to 2016. In 2013, when news of the Federal Reserve tapering its bond purchases roiled fixed income markets, the highest quartile funds lost only 3.8%, compared to 4.1% for the higher credit quality funds (Quartile 1). In this environment, where the potential for a rise in interest rates was the main market concern, exposure to credit helped to effectively diversify interest rate risk.
All that glitters is not gold.
While recent results have been compelling, several considerations suggest caution. First, while credit-heavy bond funds can mitigate interest rate shocks, potential losses from adverse equity markets can dwarf the impact of rising interest rates, as illustrated below.
For a typical portfolio with at least 50% in equities, the 2013 period was a mere blip in terms of market stress. Instead, the periods with most stress were at the end of the financial crisis in early 2009, during the discussions about a potential downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt in 2011, and when crude oil declined precipitously in 2015. During these longer and more significant stress periods, the credit-heavy intermediate bond funds experienced larger losses than their high-quality counterparts, amplifying total portfolio risk. In fact, portfolios ranging from 25% to 75% equities would have all experienced their largest losses if their fixed income portfolio was invested in the lowest credit-quality, bottom-quartile funds.
Second, while it is tempting to extrapolate from the post-crisis period, it does not represent a full market cycle. The results look markedly different if we roll back the clock 20 years, as shown in the charts below. While lower quality, bottom-quartile funds provided a relatively smooth ride during the U.S. economic recovery, they were anything but placid in the preceding years. Bottom-quartile funds lost 17% during the financial crisis and had 12-month losses in 29 episodes since 1997. In contrast, high-quality, top-quartile funds would have lost just 4% and had only 22 episodes of 12-month losses.
This illustrates a general principle: in periods of market stress, the prospect of higher defaults and lower recovery rates can widen credit spreads in low-quality bonds, while at the same time being subject to much lower liquidity. These factors expose lower quality intermediate bond funds to significant event risk and can result in large losses.
Crucially, periods of significant losses wiped out accumulated gains from lower quality funds. Over the last 20 years, bottom-quartile funds underperformed the other three quartiles despite having the highest yields and highest volatility. These findings are not merely confined to recent history. Cornell and Green (1991)* studied bond fund results from 1960 to 1989 and found that low-quality funds offered little excess return, as market corrections substantially eroded the yield advantage from these funds. Skillful managers may add value; however in aggregate, lower quality and credit-heavy intermediate bond managers may simply be picking up pennies in front of the proverbial steam roller.
Bond funds should behave like bond funds.
These findings illustrate the critical role that bond strategies must play in providing diversification and risk mitigation at the total portfolio level. Investors should seek to monitor their fixed income funds’ correlations to equities and remain vigilant against bond funds that start to behave more like equities. Investors may feel tempted to reach for income, but funds that do so regularly through lower quality securities face a higher hurdle for success. Advisors should seek to evaluate the sources of returns from their investments. Portfolio managers who can generate additional returns through interest rate risk management and investment-grade issuer selection can play a larger role in client portfolios.
In our view, fixed income portfolios fulfill four roles in an investment program – equity diversification, income, capital preservation and inflation protection. It is important to have a well-rounded fixed income program that includes strategies that satisfy all these four goals. Focusing just on income at the cost of equity diversification and capital preservation, can create unintended risks both at the strategy and the asset allocation levels.
These findings may be especially relevant today. Credit spreads have tightened significantly since the end of the crisis. At the same time, bond covenants have loosened. As a result, investments in high-yield and lower quality, investment-grade credits could face sharp losses in the next equity market correction. Before that storm hits, investors may consider moving into bond funds that behave like bond funds.

High-quality corporate bonds are a core bond strategy.
They can provide more income than government-backed bonds.
Research-driven corporate bond funds have advantages.
In the recent market rally that has been characterized by a risk-on sentiment across most asset classes, investors have gravitated to high yield and leveraged bank loans or income strategies with a heavy allocation to these extended sectors of the market. As we approach the late stages of this market rally, we think it is appropriate for investors to take a fresh look at their credit exposure.
The role of corporate bonds in a portfolio
We believe that investment-grade corporate bonds provide an attractive risk-return trade-off as a core bond fund allocation. On a long-term, secular basis, prudently managed corporate bond funds can play an important role in portfolios. Corporate bonds have historically provided income, diversification from equity holdings, as well as principal preservation.
The relationship between return and volatility can be illustrated through an efficient frontier chart. Although investors can tack on higher average returns with asset classes like high yield or emerging markets, these bonds make for poor portfolio stabilizers when economic shocks hit.
The research advantage
U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds are historically an under-researched asset class. This provides an opportunity for managers like Capital Group who use deep fundamental research. The IG corporate market has matured and become much more liquid, with a market capitalization of $5 trillion and over 1,000 issuers. This allows investors to build well-rounded, diversified corporate bond portfolios.
But that is highly dependent on strong credit selection. While credit quality is high across the asset class, a dispersion of returns occurs across issuers, sectors and ratings. Managers assessing individual securities can take advantage of this dispersion to identify the most attractive investment opportunities on a risk-adjusted basis.
Passive pitfalls
In contrast, since fixed income indices are market-value based, the most indebted issuers within each asset class are the most heavily weighted issuers. Thus, relying on passive index-based strategies means that investors are more exposed to the market’s most indebted issuers. Managers assessing individual issuers can avoid this passive pitfall by investing in debt that provides adequate risk-based returns based on issuers’ capital structures, and can capitalize on relative value opportunities they identify in the market.
Passive strategies also require new issuance to be included in the index, while managers can invest selectively based upon an issuer’s merits. Passive index-based strategies must rebalance based upon changes in market valuations, potentially requiring buying when prices are high or selling when prices are low; in contrast, managers who rely on research, buy and sell based on relative value.
U.S. IG bonds are a core asset class, providing income, diversification from equity and principal preservation. Long-term investors to the asset class have the potential to receive higher income than a government bond-driven core fund, and are less exposed to volatility than they would be in a high-yield focused multisector bond fund. An allocation to an IG corporate bond fund can improve the risk and return profiles of investors’ broader investment portfolios.

188,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/shrinking-fed-balance-sheet-bonds.html,How a shrinking federal reserve balance sheet will affect bonds,Monetary Policy,"September 20, 2017","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
As expected, the Fed has announced balance sheet tapering.
Rather than being actively sold, assets will “run-off.”
This may push 10-year Treasury yields higher over time.
We estimate that the impact could be 20 to 40 basis points.
However, long-term yields should remain range-bound.
The Federal Reserve has announced it will begin reducing its balance sheet in October. This unwind of the central bank’s massive quantitative easing programs marks a major policy change that could impact interest rates and markets more broadly.
How this move may affect markets
Long-term interest rates could move higher over the medium term as the Fed starts to shrink its asset holdings. However, the magnitude of the rise may be modest. Our fixed income interest rates team estimates the impact on 10-year Treasury yields could be 20 to 40 basis points over time, which is consistent with projections provided by the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee. This estimate is based on the assumption that the broader macroeconomic environment will not shift significantly.
Although higher yields impact bond prices, significant losses can be avoided by most fixed income investors, particularly those who rely on managed bond funds that can benefit from reinvesting in higher yielding securities, as well as from duration management.
A global perspective
The Fed was the first among the major global central banks to announce an extensive asset purchase program in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007-08. With its September 20th announcement, the Fed also becomes the first central bank to start pulling back on its quantitative easing. Other major central banks have also signaled their intent to wind down these expansive programs that have injected unprecedented liquidity in global financial markets and led to a sharp rise in asset prices and a decline in market volatility.
As monetary authorities withdraw this liquidity, we can expect financial conditions to become less accommodative. Whether this leads to lower asset prices, including those of stocks and credit securities, remains to be seen.
Overall, the U.S. economy continues to hum along, with manufacturing activity picking up, the labor market nearing full employment and consumers showing strength. The global economic backdrop remains supportive, with Europe and Japan showing signs of a pickup in GDP growth, China maintaining a growth rate in the high single digits and emerging markets broadly continuing to grow at a faster rate than developed markets in aggregate.
Looking ahead
Against this backdrop, the market has raised its expectation of the probability of a December Fed rate hike closer to our view of just over 50%. If the rate increase is implemented, it will be the fifth rate hike of this monetary cycle. The Fed has raised its policy rate four times since late 2015. This has boosted the Federal Funds rate to a range of between 1.00 and 1.25%.
Nevertheless, 10-year Treasury yields have remained mostly in the range of between 1.4% and 2.6% over this period and were hovering around 2.25% in late September. We see a handful of factors that could potentially pull these yields in two different directions.
Factors that could raise yields:
With the Fed scaling back their security holdings by reinvesting fewer of their maturing Treasuries back into the market over time, the private sector will have to absorb an increasing share of Treasuries, causing yields to rise.
As the policy rate continues to rise, demand could flow to shorter maturity securities and away from longer term yields, driving them higher.
Factors that could lower yields:
As the Fed shrinks its balance sheet and drains reserves, banks that rely on those reserves to satisfy capital rules may be impacted, which may result in higher demand for Treasuries from banks. We estimate that this could offset as much as half of the decline in Fed demand.
Quantitative easing by other central banks will likely continue. In the past, this has led to lower yields in those markets, increasing the yield differential with U.S. bonds and leading to higher demand for Treasuries.
These mixed factors, along with relatively tame inflation and a modestly growing economy, leads us to expect long-term interest rates to remain range-bound.
Once initiated, we anticipate asset tapering will operate in the background on autopilot as outlined by the Fed, provided there are no major shocks to the economic recovery. Mortgage-backed securities may be vulnerable to the Fed tapering. Although MBS have already felt some impact given tapering expectations, and having cheapened earlier this year against Treasuries, additional uncertainty on the impact of reduced Fed purchases could weigh on this sector.
How will the Fed reduce its balance sheet?
In its September post-meeting statement, the Fed said it was following through with its plans outlined earlier this year, which would commence in October. The Fed will structure its balance sheet reduction by capping the amount of proceeds it reinvests from maturing securities, starting at $10 billion per month, with a 60-40 split of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, and gradually increasing the cap over the year to a total of $50 billion. That terminal principal reinvestment reduction will remain in place until the size of the balance sheet is normalized. While unlikely to fall all the way back to its pre-crisis size of $1 trillion, we expect the balance sheet to stabilize at assets of around $3.3 trillion from a high of over $4.5 trillion.
This policy change represents a major step for the Fed. However, with a potentially modest effect on rates over time, investors in well-managed bond funds shouldn’t feel a dramatic impact. While we expect long-term rates to remain range-bound, as financial conditions become less accommodative, credit sectors are vulnerable to spread widening. We remain cautious on credit assets, especially high yield, where yields have declined substantially and may not adequately reflect the embedded risks.

189,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/bonds-american-retailers.html,Deepening fissures: Navigating the shifting ground of American retail,Bonds,"August 16, 2017","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Internet commerce continues to shake up retailers.
Discount retailers are coping better than larger brands.
With bonds pricing at rich levels, we remain selective.
Brick-and-mortar retail stores are under pressure like never before. Although the trend began two decades ago, internet commerce has changed the retail landscape in a profound way and at unprecedented speed.
Retailers have navigated a history of cyclical pressures ranging from soft economies, swings in real estate valuations, supply chain disruptions and evolving consumer behavior. However, the current environment is different, creating structural fissures that have shuttered many stores and forced them to rethink their business models.
The challenges retailers face
Not all retailers face gloom and doom, but many continue to struggle. The explosion in internet commerce has forced many brick-and-mortar retailers into shrinking their physical footprints and/or trying to shift more business online. Across many developed markets in recent years there have been other unwelcome factors, such as:
Anemic wage growth
Altered consumer behavior since the Great Recession (e.g., consumers hooked on discounts or promotions)
The growing impact of millennials with both diminished brand loyalty and new consumption patterns
E-commerce has brought two clear structural changes, impacting balance sheets, credit profiles, ratings and bond valuations of such companies. First, greater price transparency has put pressure on the margins of many brick-and-mortar retailers since they have a relatively higher fixed-cost base than their online peers. Hence, adjusted profit margins are unlikely to return to historical levels anytime soon.
Second, traditional business models are shifting. Most large retailers have been actively managing their real estate with a view to closing underperforming (but sometimes still profitable) stores. They are maximizing investments in good locations while adjusting or investing in distribution and warehouse capabilities. Nevertheless, many companies are still in the early stages of a longer term effort to grow their online businesses, while strategically repurposing physical stores to support an omni-channel sales approach.
Discerning the winners from the losers
Across the retail sector, the impact is uneven. The least affected retailers thus far are deep discounters, such as Dollar General and T.J. Maxx. Other less impacted subsectors include large home improvement retailers, such as Home Depot and Lowe’s, and aftermarket auto parts stores like AutoZone.
Meanwhile, the retail grocery segment also is changing rapidly. Amazon is one of many competitors, with most large grocers (including Wal-Mart as the largest) attempting to develop effective online platforms while trying to address changing consumer preferences. Office supply and department stores have been the worst hit by the e-commerce storm, experiencing meaningful deterioration in financial performance and credit ratings.
In summary, structural transformation and heightened credit risks persist for many investment-grade retailers as many bonds are approaching historically rich valuations. Within the context of a market landscape characterized by low interest rates and relatively tight bond spreads to Treasuries and in the absence of adequate compensation to bond holders for the spectrum of risks, we continue to take a cautious approach to investing in this evolving retail universe.

190,fixed_income,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/tips-have-place-in-portfolio.html,Here’s a tip: TIPS have a place in a portfolio,Inflation,"June 30, 2017","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Last fall, inflation expectations began to increase
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) prices rose.
In recent months, inflation has missed expectations.
Sporadic adjustments help to explain this weakness.
We see a strong medium-term upside potential for TIPS.
Over the past six months, financial markets have experienced relatively large moves, and TIPS have been no exception. After President Trump’s election, the TIPS market re-priced10-year inflation expectations from 1.7% to about 2.1% early this year. But as concerns have grown about the new administration’s ability to navigate Congress, the TIPS market has tempered its view, with inflation expectations now closer to 1.85%. At these prices, we continue to like the TIPS asset class.
How will TIPS behave in different market environments?
First of all, it may be worth restating that TIPS are, indeed, bonds. If interest rates rise rapidly and/or substantially, the price of TIPS will likely decline. However, here are the two key points worth noting with respect to rising rates:
If longer term interest rates climb, there is a good chance they will do so because of rising inflation. In this environment, TIPS should outperform most other fixed income assets.
If longer term interest rates rise for non-inflationary reasons (i.e., real growth accelerates because of higher productivity), equities should gain and provide portfolios with upside potential.
If interest rates fall, TIPS should do well because bond prices generally will rise. While we believe TIPS will likely underperform nominal Treasuries in a low inflation, low interest-rate environment, our expectation is that they would still have positive returns.
TIPS today
We believe TIPS valuations are attractive today. We will explain why by discussing recent trends, as well as by analyzing the weakness in the recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports.
From the end of 2014 to the end of 2016, core inflation (CPI inflation excluding the volatile energy and food components) rose from 1.6% to 2.2%. This move made sense in light of the labor market’s tightening, the national unemployment rate falling from 5.6% to 4.7% over that same period and the money having been printed during three rounds of quantitative easing remaining in the financial system.
However, core inflation has softened noticeably in recent months, with the year-over-year rate declining back down to 1.7% in May. While this softening has been surprisingly persistent over the past three months, there are reasons to believe inflation will rebound back to the +2% trend in the months ahead.
First, nearly half of the recent decline can be attributed to one-off factors that, to us, appear unlikely to further weigh on CPI going forward. Second, labor market slack continues to decline and wage pressures are gradually rising. Wage growth, as measured by the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank, remains at a robust level of 3.4%. As this wage pressure builds, and with May’s 4.3% unemployment rate indicating a tight labor market, we think the conditions are ripe for inflation to gradually move higher in the months to come.
In her June press conference, Chair Janet Yellen indicated that the Fed shares these views. In response to a question on inflation, Yellen said, “There have been some idiosyncratic factors I think that have held down inflation in recent months,” and that Fed policymakers “continue to feel that with a strong labor market … the conditions are in place for inflation to move up.”
In April of this year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the CPI estimate for March. Along with most of the market, we were surprised to see that core inflation fell from February by 0.12% — the biggest month-over-month decline since 1962. This was followed by a 0.07% increase in April, which was also below market expectations. As a result, the year-over-year rate slowed to 1.9% from 2.2% in February. Looking into the details of these inflation reports, our view is that this will likely be a temporary slowdown, and that in the next few months we should see CPI return to a trend of between 2.0% and 2.5%.
The biggest negative surprise in the March CPI report was wireless telephone service prices. Absent this factor, core CPI was positive for the month. We think this reflects a one-time adjustment. In April, physician services surprised with the largest monthly drop in 25 years. Given historical changes in the series and the lack of a clear cause, we believe the move to be a temporary outlier and to reverse in the months to come.
There were other categories that were weak for more structural reasons, such as new and used vehicle prices, which are declining due to elevated auto inventory-to-sales ratios. However, other core components remain robust, led by shelter and medical care services (excluding the temporary drop in physician services) that make up more than 58% of core CPI. With the labor market continuing to tighten, the unemployment rate falling to 4.3% and economic growth steady at around 2%, we see little reason to think the weakness in inflation will persist in the months ahead.
Conclusion
TIPS are unique because they are explicitly linked to CPI inflation, therefore offering a direct means of protecting purchasing power over time. American Funds Inflation Linked Bond Fund® can provide investors an allocation to TIPS, which are an out-of-benchmark (Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index) allocation for core bond funds. Depending on market valuations, these funds may or may not hold TIPS. A dedicated allocation to TIPS like our fund offers can complement a broader bond portfolio which may not hold up well in an inflationary environment. Since TIPS are government bonds, they can also add a measure of stability to portfolios in times of equity market volatility.

Some might say that means the dollar is set to appreciate even further as the Federal Reserve quickens its pace of interest rate hikes.
But Capital Group currencies analyst Jens Søndergaard thinks that with real interest rate differentials already at 10-year highs, it’s more likely that the relative rates will narrow and the dollar will weaken.
“It’s hard to imagine that foreign real rates won’t follow the U.S. if the U.S. growth acceleration helps bring about an upturn in global growth. It’s equally hard to imagine foreign real rates falling further, given their current very low levels,” Søndergaard says. For U.S.-based investors, a weaker dollar would boost international equity returns, which have lagged domestic equities in recent years.

The failure of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10 reminds me of what I experienced firsthand as a bank analyst during the global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008.
As a professional investor for 30 years, I rely on my own experiences to help guide my investment approach. When I was a bank analyst then, I captured the 10 lessons below to serve as a guide for myself and colleagues to help get us to the other side of the valley.
Every crisis is different, but they often have things in common. Today’s turmoil shares some striking similarities, though, in my view, this current episode is much smaller in scale and far less damaging.
Last summer, with rates rising, inflation high and the prospect of recession looming, I unearthed these lessons from 15 years ago and shared them again. And when Silicon Valley Bank failed a few weeks ago, I circulated them once more to offer perspective and help colleagues manage the uncertainty. Here are those lessons, which I believe bear repeating.
Wisdom earned in crisis
When the weathermen pack umbrellas, the forecast is for rain. Bank treasurers started hoarding liquidity — assets that can easily be converted to cash — in mid-2007 when liquidity was not on anyone’s radar screen. It should have been a clear warning sign.
Liquidity is a coward. Regardless of balance sheet strength or franchise value, if liquidity evaporates, which it has tended to do at the first sign of trouble, perception of weakness becomes reality.
The long-term outlook only matters if you can make it to the long term. The 2007–2008 cycle progressed from one of concern about earnings to concern about capital to concern about liquidity. Not until we reverse the cycle and return to a focus on earnings do I expect this cycle to end, and by then many institutions may no longer be with us.
There is no silver bullet. Selling into every rally on government fixes would have been the right call during the early stages of the global financial crisis. Drastic events require drastic measures; anything less would be a disappointment.
Avoid the most aggressive companies. When you hear the words growth and innovation as they relate to lending businesses, proceed with caution. Making cross-industry comparisons can help provide guard rails for assessing where the dangers might be. Variations in outcomes between the least and most aggressive companies can be huge.
Bad news is bad news. If a company needs capital and/or has to cut its dividend, consider getting out of the way, even if it looks like it’s priced into the stock.
Don’t try to navigate uncharted waters. When circumstances change so drastically that even an experienced investment analyst has a hard time digesting events, I think it’s best to walk away. This was true in the technology boom-bust cycle in the late-1990s as well as the global financial crisis. The break with the past was so significant in both cases that history no longer served as a guide.
Good loans are made in bad times and bad loans are made in good times. The winners in a credit cycle will usually be those with the capital and liquidity to capitalize on the distress.
Trust your instincts and act. The discontinuity of a crisis can be paralyzing, but it’s important to remain flexible and continue to take action with a forward-thinking mindset.
Take care of yourself. Sleep, exercise and healthy diet are important to maintaining a constructive attitude. We owe it to ourselves, our families and our clients to stay healthy.

Putting investing lessons into action
It is difficult to predict when the current crisis will end, but experience has taught me that it will and that we will get through this. Time and time again, markets have demonstrated a remarkable ability to endure and recover from crisis and thrive.
Today, as a portfolio manager and principal investment officer for American Mutual Fund®, I spend much of my time focused on preservation of capital and draw from my personal experiences in past crises in that effort.
I also rely on the wisdom of colleagues. At Capital Group we have many veteran investors with deep experience. Some 37% of our portfolio managers have more than 30 years of investment experience while 89% have 20 or more.
The importance of experience

Moving beyond the banking turmoil
Moving beyond financial crises takes time and can be messy. Regulators have taken swift action to try to contain the damage and restore confidence, and they have been coming up with some very creative solutions. But those remedies will need time to be tested by the market. So, patience is crucial.
Going forward, I expect to see a dramatic tightening in lending standards. Small- to mid-sized banks are likely to be subject to stricter regulations — along the lines of the requirements for the largest financial institutions. Those likely include higher capital and liquidity requirements, periodic stress testing and restrictions on the types of investments banks can employ in their bond portfolios.
As in any cycle there will be winners. My view is that the strong will get stronger. That includes banks as well as companies in other industries that generate strong cash flow and can fund their own growth. For example, select technology giants are cash-flow positive today. Some of them made massive investments in their businesses when rates were near zero. It would be much more expensive for competitors to challenge those incumbents today.
Across industries, I believe opportunities will surface. The key for investors is to remain calm, look past the turbulence and be ready to act when opportunity does arise.

195,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/fed-march-2023-rate-outlook.html,Bank failures push Fed to proceed with caution,Fed,"March 22, 2023","The U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points (bps) this week, despite turmoil in the banking sector, as it remains focused on bringing down inflation.
In recent weeks, Fed Chair Jerome Powell opened the door to a potential return to jumbo-sized rate hikes, however after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, the Fed chose to proceed with a more modest increase. The 25 bps increase brings the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5% – a level markets expect could be close to the peak in this cycle.
""Since our previous Federal Open Market Committee meeting, economic indicators have generally come in stronger than expected, demonstrating greater momentum in economic activity and inflation,"" Powell said. ""We believe, however, that events in the banking system over the past two weeks are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes.""
Inflation remains elevated, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rising 6% in February and core services ex-housing inflation (which Powell has cited as the “most important” measure of inflation) up 5% year over year. The U.S. labor market has also shown resilience, with unemployment hovering near multi-decade lows and more than 300,000 new jobs added in February.
The latest Summary of Economic Projections suggests that Fed governors expect only one more rate hike this year. But Powell reiterated the rate cuts were not in the Fed’s “base case.”
“If we need to raise rates higher, we will,” he said. “I think for now, though, we see the likelihood of credit tightening. We know that can have an effect on the macroeconomy, on demand, on the labor market, on inflation.”
Markets ended mixed on the day after the announcement, with the S&P 500 Index down 1.65% and the yields on 2- and 5-year Treasury notes falling around 20 bps. (Bond prices move inversely to yields.)
Here are the latest views from Tim Ng, a fixed income portfolio manager and member of Capital Group’s U.S. rates team.
The Fed will likely maintain a hiking bias until the economic outlook deteriorates further, but the scope to aggressively tighten policy has narrowed with the recent developments in the banking sector. Prior to the collapse of SVB, Powell hinted at redeploying larger rate hikes given the persistence of inflation.
My expectation now is that the Fed will proceed more cautiously with rate increases, with a reasonable probability the hiking cycle will end later this year.
The fallout from the recent banking crisis will likely be negative for credit growth in the coming quarters as the sector undergoes more regulatory scrutiny, competes more aggressively for deposits and tightens lending standards. In turn, this will likely lead to lower demand and slower economic growth, which should help with the Fed’s goal of lowering inflation.
We still favor a yield curve steepener (a position designed to profit when the difference between yields on long- and short-term bonds increases) based on the expectation that the Fed will eventually ease monetary policy as economic growth slows and inflation comes down. We have generally preferred yield curve steepeners over outright duration positions, as we see greater return potential in yield curve positioning given how inverted the Treasury curve is by historical standards.
We have been somewhat cautious on credit in most core bond and core plus bond portfolios. Given the potential spillover effect from regional bank issues, we have seen some pressure on credit spreads, and this could continue as a recession becomes imminent.

Consumer Price Index (CPI): A commonly used measure of inflation that measures the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and services. Core goods include commodities less food and energy commodities, and core services include services less energy services. Core CPI includes all items less food and energy.
Credit spread is the difference in yield (the expected return on an investment over a particular period of time) between a government bond and another debt security of the same maturity but different credit quality. Credit spreads typically measure the perceived riskiness of a corporate bond relative to a safer investment, typically the equivalent government bond; the wider the spread, the riskier the corporate bond. A period of widening (increase in the spread) reflects an increase in this perceived credit riskiness. Option-adjusted spread takes into account investors' ability to prematurely redeem a security. The value of fixed income securities may be affected by changing interest rates and changes in credit ratings of the securities.
Duration is a measure of the approximate sensitivity of a bond portfolio's value to interest rate changes. 
Yield curve measures the difference between the yields of bonds of different maturities. A yield curve is said to be inverted when shorter term bonds provide higher yields than longer term bonds.
Yield curve steepening occurs with long-term rates rising more than short-term rates, or short-term rates falling more than long-term rates."
196,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/what-svb-collapse-means-investors.html,What the SVB collapse means for investors,Market Volatility,"March 22, 2023","For more than a year, investors have wondered what might prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to alter its aggressive rate-hiking path. The collapse of SVB Financial, parent company of Silicon Valley Bank, may have provided the answer.
The demise of the 16th largest bank in the United States has dramatically changed the interest rate outlook for the balance of 2023 — and beyond — as the market ponders how the Fed and other central banks will react to growing turmoil in the sector. With fear of contagion spreading, European banks also have come under pressure, forcing regulators to step in and shore up unsteady financial institutions.
Over the weekend, Swiss banking giant UBS agreed to acquire its longtime rival Credit Suisse for more than $3 billion in a deal encouraged by regulators to help restore confidence in the global banking system.
These rapidly unfolding events have led to an environment where the Fed — unquestionably planning to hike rates just two weeks ago — is now tempering its hawkish tone and may even start cutting rates before the end of the year.
On Wednesday, the Fed increased its key policy rate by 25 basis points, but central bank officials omitted language from previous policy statements referring to the need for “ongoing” rate increases. Moreover, a rapid decline in bond yields over the past two weeks means investors expect the Fed to cut rates as expectations for economic growth and inflation fall, says Pramod Atluri, principal investment officer of The Bond Fund of America®.
“The dislocations we are seeing in the financial markets signal a painful new phase for the Fed,” Atluri says. “We knew there would be consequences to one of the most aggressive tightening campaigns in history. It has clearly exposed some vulnerabilities in the banking system and, as a result, we may be nearing the end of the rate hikes.”

Recession risk on the rise
If investors were expecting a recession this year — and many were — adding a banking crisis into the mix considerably darkens the outlook, says Capital Group economist Jared Franz.
One reason bond yields are falling so quickly is that market participants are now predicting a recession more vociferously than before SVB’s troubles emerged. One strong indicator of that is an inverted yield curve — where the yield on short-term U.S. Treasury bonds is higher than the yield on longer dated bonds.
“That’s the most reliable recession indicator we have,” Franz explains.
Inverted yield curve warns of recession risk
Sources: Capital Group, Bloomberg Index Services Ltd., National Bureau of Economic Research, Refinitiv Datastream. As of March 17, 2023.
Recessions with a banking sector component are generally worse, on average, than more typical downturns, Franz says. That’s because banks will generally tighten lending standards, which then has a knock-on effect for the rest of the economy as it becomes harder for companies and individuals to get financing. Consumer spending and hiring are also likely to be impacted, he adds, as people save more money and companies announce layoffs.
Franz expects U.S. gross domestic product to decline by roughly 1.5% to 2.0% for the full year, compared to a previously expected decline of 1.0%. “That would still be well below the recessionary pain felt during the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2009, when GDP fell 4.3%, which this is clearly not,” Franz stresses.
What about inflation?
The challenge for the Fed is that inflation remains high. On a year-over-year basis, the U.S. Consumer Price Index stood at 6% in February, far above the Fed’s 2% target. That could put pressure on Fed officials to avoid cutting rates too soon. Instead, they may wait to see how much financial conditions tighten in the months ahead should additional turmoil unfold in the banking sector or elsewhere.
“The Fed still has a battle against inflation they need to wage,” Franz explains. “Ironically, the failure of SVB may help Fed officials accomplish their goal of contracting financial conditions so demand falls alongside inflationary pressures.
“We’re only two weeks into this situation, so it’s tough to say how it will ultimately play out. A lot depends on the regulatory response and whether the contagion spreads to other banks. It’s a fluid situation, and I don’t think anybody has all the answers, but hopefully we are asking the right questions.”

Troubled banks? We’ve been here before
Will Robbins, a Capital Group portfolio manager and former banking analyst, remains confident that the overall health of the U.S. banking system is strong. He believes it will simply take time for the turbulence to subside. Regulators have acted swiftly to contain the panic among regional bank investors, he notes, and larger banks have stepped in to help fund the rescue efforts.
“We’ve been here before,” says Robbins, who has covered the banking industry for more than 30 years. “This is an old-fashioned bank run. It’s going to be messy, and it’s going to take a while to sort things out. But I think we are well positioned to get through it.”
Going forward, Robbins expects to see several actions following SVB’s collapse, including a dramatic tightening of lending standards, stricter regulations for small- and mid-sized banks, and a resulting pressure on their ability to generate healthy profits.
“Longer term, I do think the earnings power of smaller banks will be impaired as a result of falling under the same regulatory regime that large banks were subjected to following the financial crisis,” Robbins says. Those included higher capital and liquidity requirements, periodic stress testing and restrictions on the types of investments banks can employ in their bond portfolios. In general, banks with less than $250 billion in assets have been exempt from such regulations.

Events are rapidly unfolding, Robbins cautions, so it will be important for investors to continue monitoring the situation.
“Central banks have moved swiftly to try and contain the spread of contagion across the financial system,” Robbins says. “We are still in the thick of it, so we cannot predict the path this will ultimately take.”

Is ‘Too Big to Fail’ now a positive?
As with any crisis, this one also presents potential investment opportunities, especially for investors with a long-term horizon.
Large U.S. banks, for instance, are already seeing a massive inflow of deposits as customers switch from regional institutions to the perceived safety of the big four: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo.
Likewise, other large companies with strong balance sheets and the ability to fund their own growth should benefit, relatively speaking, from an environment in which it becomes tougher to access capital markets. Big technology and consumer tech companies from Apple to Amazon could once again find themselves the center of attention if interest rates move significantly lower.
“These are the same companies that did poorly when rates were going up,” Robbins explains. “Now there’s an argument to be made that they are still growing in a low-growth environment. They don’t need access to capital to grow. And in many cases they already funded their major capital investments at a time when the cost of capital was much lower.
“So if there’s an expectation that rates are going down, or at least they aren’t going as high as previously thought,” he continues, “growth-oriented companies could be seen as more valuable, particularly the incumbents that funded their growth years ago.”

197,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/views-collapse-svb-financial.html,Views on the collapse of SVB Financial,Market Volatility,"March 13, 2023","The sudden collapse of SVB Financial, a California-based bank focused on technology startups, has raised important questions about the health of the U.S. banking system and the government’s response to yet another crisis in the financial sector. Will additional small and regional banks face a similar fate? Are larger banks at risk? And will the U.S. Federal Reserve alter its expected rate-hiking path in response?
Here are the views of Capital Group analysts focused on these rapidly evolving events:
Will it lead to more regional banks failing?
Aleks Ivanova, U.S. banking analyst
Over the weekend, regulators took action to protect all insured and uninsured depositors affected by the collapse of SVB (parent of Silicon Valley Bank) and Signature Bank (SBNY), a New York-based bank. Meanwhile, First Republic Bank (FRC) announced that it has obtained additional liquidity from the Federal Reserve and JP Morgan.
Fed officials said they would also increase available liquidity to banks through a new facility — the Bank Term Funding Program. This facility will offer loans of up to one year to banks that pledge U.S. Treasury securities, mortgage-backed securities and other collateral at par. This means that banks can obtain liquidity without incurring the losses that come from selling Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities, which have declined in value as a result of rising interest rates. These actions were designed to limit the risk of further bank runs on small- and mid-sized banks.
That said, these actions essentially give affected banks a year to get their balance sheets in order. They do not remove the underlying loss created from rising interest rates; they just buy time for bank executives and regulators to manage it. The expectation is that the combination of deposit guarantees and the provision of liquidity will be enough to stem the contagion and avoid additional deposit runs.
As a consequence of these actions, the regulatory environment will likely tighten from here for small- and mid-tier banks. Regulators may require these banks to hold more capital, which in turn will structurally lower their profitability. Regulatory changes can be phased in over multiple years, similar to what we saw after the global financial crisis.
The regional small- and mid-tier banks have generally traded at a premium to large money center banks as they generated higher growth rates and are subject to lower capital requirements and less regulation. In addition to regulation, the events of the past week will likely lead corporate treasurers to rethink or possibly diversify their banking relationships. This dynamic could make it more challenging even for the best small banks to attract and retain deposits.
What is the risk to the big money center banks?
Tracy Li, U.S. banking analyst
Big money center banks are better diversified, well capitalized, generally more liquid and subject to much more stringent regulations than small banks. The differences include much higher capital requirements, liquidity requirements, leverage limitations, frequency of stress testing and treatment of the mark-to-market securities portfolios — avoiding the kind of asset liability mismatch that brought down SVB.
The big banks, designated as Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs), do not present compelling valuation, in my view, and do not appear to be fully reflecting neither the risk of a recession in the U.S. nor the financial risks of a late cycle economy.
Will the Fed postpone raising rates?
Jared Franz, U.S. economist
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who is well-versed in crisis management, mobilized regulators over the weekend and on Sunday announced the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) as a backstop facility for depository institutions. This is consistent with the central bank playbook in times of emergency to err on the side of caution and go big.
In addition, the Fed statement said: ""The Board is closely monitoring conditions across the financial system and is prepared to use its full range of tools to support households and businesses, and will take additional steps as appropriate.""
The failure of these sizable regional banks combined with the shock to the banking sector will likely accelerate the tightening of financial conditions, thus making an economic slowdown or an outright recession more likely.
In the near term, the Fed may take a 50-basis-point rate hike off the table. But if financial markets stabilize, I think the Fed will pivot back to inflation fighting. The central bank will want to separate liquidity operations from inflation progress. The recent strength in employment nonfarm payrolls shows that elevated inflation remains a significant risk.
How have fixed income markets responded?
Pramod Atluri, fixed income portfolio manager
The collapse of SVB powered a rally in government bonds. The yield curve has steepened significantly with yields on shorter dated Treasuries falling more than those that are longer dated. The sharp decline in yields signals investors believe that financial stability concerns as well as the associated tightening of financial conditions may give the Fed the ability to end its aggressive hiking campaign to stem inflationary pressures.
The market, which had last week priced in a peak federal funds rate of 5.50%, has now priced in 4.75% as the peak — effectively saying we’ll have one more hike and then done. Credit spreads have widened as investors digest the potential impact of tighter financial conditions ahead and the greater chance of slower economic growth leading to a potential recession.
I agree that the Fed will likely delay rate hikes next week in the wake of these developments. When you're looking at the prospect of more bank regulations resulting from this and other banks raising deposit rates to compete, it essentially translates to greater tightening of financial conditions.
This is a fluid situation, and credit spreads are widening given expectations of a weaker economy. We have low exposure to the regional banks across bond portfolios. Our investments are mostly in the large money center banks, which are already highly regulated entities and therefore unlikely to face similar pressures. We will closely watch developments over the coming weeks and be very selective.
Is there contagion risk to the European banks?
Matteo Merlo, European banking analyst
I don’t expect European banks to face the same crisis of confidence. Europe has a higher level of regulation that applies equally to small banks. Similar to the large U.S. banks, European banks generally have a more diversified deposit base and ample liquidity buffers.
From an operating standpoint the European banking sector is arguably in its strongest position since the global financial crisis. Capital ratios and profitability are at all-time highs. BNP, Barclays and UniCredit, for example, have all built up excess capital and have 15%-20% of their balance sheets in liquidity reserves.
In addition, most banks remain deposit-rich. The European Central Bank (ECB) regularly stress tests banks to measure potential risk from higher rates on bank portfolios. (The impact of a 200-basis-point move higher in rates cannot be more than a greater than or less than 15% of the tangible book value.) Regulators have also signed off on dividend and share buyback plans. This suggests the ECB sees no major risks on the horizon.
SVB had a unique banking model, mainly serving customers in the venture capital community. Venture capital is less developed in Europe, and European banks generally have a well-diversified customer base. That said, in an environment of rising rates and quantitative tightening, unforeseen issues can emerge.
What is the impact of SVB failure on technology companies?
David Penner, technology analyst
SVB’s failure will have a negative impact, at least in the near term, on startups and their venture capital sponsors. But I don’t see it as particularly disruptive to most public software firms and, broadly speaking, the large technology companies.
These companies do not bank primarily or at all with SVB, so there is limited or little direct exposure. Most graduate to bigger banks with scale and through relationships forged during capital markets events, including initial public offerings.
They sell primarily to large enterprise customers with startups being a small minority of their clients. As such, the indirect exposure through stretched receivables and reduced spending is minimal.
Most of the large tech companies are free cash flow positive and not reliant on potentially tied-up deposits, better enabling them to handle stretched out receivables from a minority of customers.

198,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/10-investment-themes.html,10 investment themes for 2023,Long-Term Investing,"March 8, 2023","There’s a new reality taking shape that could define global markets over the next decade.
Although many investors are expecting a return to normal after inflation subsides and central banks stop raising interest rates, we believe markets are undergoing significant changes. Investors may need to reset expectations in this new environment.
One change that’s already underway is the shift from narrow to broad market leadership. A handful of tech stocks dominated markets for years, but we expect a much wider range of investments to drive portfolio returns going forward. That’s why we asked our investment team to highlight the trends they are most closely following today.
Here are 10 investment themes for 2023:
1. Dividend stocks could power portfolios for the next decade
2. Growth investing will require a new approach
3. Nimble multinational companies are becoming global champions
4. Innovation is leading to a golden age of health care
5. Industrial renaissance could benefit pick-and-shovel companies
6. Reshoring supply chains will create new opportunities across industries
7. Core bonds can provide strength when equities are weak
8. Credit fundamentals are making a comeback
9. High-yield bonds are earning their name again
10. 60/40 portfolios are alive and well
1. Dividend stocks could power portfolios for the next decade
Caroline Randall, equity portfolio manager, Capital Income Builder®
Dividend investing may have seemed downright dull over the last decade as tech titans dominated market returns, but today, boring is beautiful.
With growth slowing and the cost of capital rising, I expect dividends to be a more significant and stable contributor to total return going forward. Dividends accounted for only 16% of total return in the 2010s, but historically the average has hovered around 38%, peaking at 72% during the inflationary 1970s.
Expect dividends to account for a larger portion of total return
Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. 2020s data is from 1/1/20 through 12/31/22. *Total return for the S&P 500 Index was negative for the 2000s. Dividends provided a 1.8% annualized return over the decade. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
I’m finding many dividend opportunities across sectors, including industrials, utilities and health care. Pharmaceutical companies can be attractive in an inflationary environment, as many tend to have strong balance sheets and cash flows and are often able to raise prices even in a highly competitive marketplace. Several leading companies also have a dividend yield above 3%, including AbbVie (3.7% yield, as of December 31, 2022) and Gilead Sciences (3.4%).

2. Growth investing will require a new approach
Martin Romo, equity portfolio manager, The Growth Fund of America®
Growth stocks have come under intense pressure, but for some companies I think the market is throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
As a growth investor, it’s essential to differentiate between companies that have reached the end of their runway or are facing stiffer competition with those that are simply in a cyclical slowdown. If you can find companies set to re-accelerate when the economy improves, you may find promising buying opportunities.
The pace of innovation around the world is picking up again. Several colleagues and I recently spent a few weeks in Silicon Valley meeting with public companies and venture capital firms, and I came away believing we are at an inflection point with artificial intelligence. Microsoft's $10 billion investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI is a recent example, but the push to develop innovative uses of AI is happening all around.
The pace of adoption of new technologies is accelerating
Source: Statista. As of 12/31/22. Kickstarter refers to number of backers. Airbnb refers to number of nights booked. Foursquare and Instagram refer to number of downloads.
This feels like the early days of mobile and cloud as they entered an era of hyper-charged growth. It’s an open-ended opportunity for companies that can leverage the technology to genuinely differentiate their product offerings and deliver enhanced productivity to customers. Despite the challenging environment, I remain excited about the long-term investment opportunities on the horizon.

3. Nimble multinational companies are becoming global champions
Jody Jonsson, equity portfolio manager, New Perspective Fund®
It may seem like a challenging time to be a global investor, but I think this is when the best companies shine.
Investors are concerned about de-globalization and assume it is negative for portfolios. It can be, but changes in trade patterns generally favor global champions — what I call industry-leading multinationals that can adjust to the changing landscape. The COVID-19 crisis shed light on the importance of resilience over efficiency, and companies are responding by establishing redundancies in supply chains. That's creating opportunities for companies that help build factories and expand supply lines.
For example, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the largest pure-play semiconductor maker, plans to build factories in Arizona and Japan and anticipates nearly half of its leading-edge chip production will happen outside of Taiwan in the years ahead. As new facilities are built, Caterpillar, the world's largest manufacturer of construction equipment, could see increased demand for its products.
A new breed of multinational companies has arrived
Sources: Capital Group, FactSet, RIMES. Includes all companies within the MSCI ACWI IMI as of 1/31/03 and 12/31/22. Top eight countries as of 12/31/22 are shown.
Global stocks should also benefit as two notable headwinds dissipate. It appears that the strong U.S. dollar may have peaked, which would support dollar-based returns of U.S. and international stocks alike. Also, the reopening of China’s economy should boost global economic growth, especially in emerging markets.
In the portfolios that I manage, I focus primarily on “supertankers” — dominant companies that generate solid cash flow, enjoy strong competitive moats and have the ability to fund their own growth — in industries such as health care, semiconductors and insurance.

4. Innovation is leading to a golden age of health care
Diana Wagner, equity portfolio manager, Washington Mutual Investors Fund
Innovation is at an all-time high in health care. The macro environment may have topped investor concerns over the last year, but innovation is what has ultimately driven long-term value creation.
Pharmaceutical companies have invested heavily in drug discovery in recent years and, as a result, deep pipelines of pioneering treatments are being developed to tackle some of the world’s biggest health issues. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, for example, have developed obesity treatments with the potential to reduce body weight by as much as 25%. AstraZeneca has become an oncology leader with advanced therapies for lung, bladder and breast cancer.
Gene sequencing is another key innovation with major health and investment implications. In the future, we may be able to pair genetic sequencing with gene-based interventions to deliver personalized, precision medicine. Imagine replacing defective or missing genes with normal, healthy ones. That future is not far off, in my view.
I find opportunities in health care services equally exciting. Most doctors operate in a traditional fee-for-service model, getting paid based on volume. But companies like UnitedHealth and Humana are instead rewarding doctors for keeping patients heathy through new payment models. These models seek to achieve the so-called “quadruple aim” in health care — better outcomes, higher patient satisfaction and higher physician satisfaction at a lower cost per capita. Achieving all four is now a real possibility.

5. Industrial renaissance could benefit pick-and-shovel companies
Cheryl Frank, equity portfolio manager, American Mutual Fund®
CapEx is on the rise, and it could be setting the stage for an industrial renaissance.
I’m paying close attention to how increased capital expenditures will benefit suppliers across industries — what I call pick-and-shovel companies. Investors sometimes overlook these businesses, but they often have more stable cash flows and lower risk profiles compared to the companies they service.
Record-breaking cash flow over the last 12 months has left oil producers with some of the strongest balance sheets in history. When energy companies profit, they typically expand exploration and production, which requires more machinery and services. This could be a source of growth for companies that provide technology, products and services to the energy industry.
Four trends could contribute to an industrial renaissance
Sources: Capital Group, MSCI. Company examples reflect some of the largest constituents (ranked by descending market value) within the MSCI ACWI that fall into GICS sub-industries that supply products and/or services aligned with the factors expected to contribute to capital expenditures listed above. As of 1/17/23.
Another interesting trend is how much money has flowed into health care research and development (R&D). Pharmaceutical companies that successfully developed vaccines and anti-viral treatments like Pfizer piled up cash. Much of this capital will likely be funneled into more R&D for companies that support the biopharma industry, such as Danaher and Thermo Fisher Scientific.

6. Reshoring supply chains will create new opportunities across industries
Winnie Kwan, equity portfolio manager, New World Fund®
Supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and mounting geopolitical tensions prompted many companies to rethink their global sourcing capabilities. The strategy now focuses on balancing efficiency, reliability and security — with the intention to diversify by reshoring and onshoring manufacturing.
There’s a common misconception that this trend will displace China as the world’s largest manufacturing base. Rather, many companies are shifting to a “China +1 strategy” by maintaining operations in the country while adding facilities elsewhere. Incremental investments in China will focus primarily on the domestic market, while additional investments in other locations will serve the rest of the world.
Southeast Asia, Mexico, India and the United States are some of the top relocation destinations. Companies that facilitate this transition — like Japanese automation enablers or REITs in India — may be well positioned to take advantage of this trend.
Southeast Asia is well positioned for the rewiring of global supply chains
Source: AmCham Shanghai 2021 China Business Report, published September 22, 2021. Based on a survey of 338 foreign companies doing business in China. Of those companies, 63 said they were redirecting investments from China to other locations, including Southeast Asia, Mexico, India and the United States, among others. Survey respondents could provide multiple responses, so total does not add up to 100%.
It could take a decade for companies to fully transition, but the process is certainly underway. I believe it will be one of the more important investment themes of the 2020s.

7. Core bonds can provide strength when equities are weak
Pramod Atluri, fixed income portfolio manager, The Bond Fund of America®
Strong income opportunities and a potential economic slowdown could make core bonds the star of a well-diversified portfolio.
You can’t read the news these days without seeing the word recession. While slowing growth may be a headwind for many asset classes, for core bonds, it’s nirvana. Slowing growth, declining inflation, higher yields and a Federal Reserve nearing the end of its hiking cycle all add up to a fantastic opportunity for core bond funds to generate mid-single-digit total returns and, once again, provide ballast to a portfolio.
The starting yield of core bonds hovers around 4.7% (as measured by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index, as of December 31, 2022), which is a good indicator of long-term return expectations. As an active manager, I seek to add excess return by managing interest rate sensitivity, sector allocation, security selection and other levers.
And if a recession does hit, bringing inflation down faster than expected, further upside is possible. Interest rates would likely decline, leading to meaningful bond price appreciation. For example, a 50-basis-point decline in rates would translate to a roughly 3% gain for core bonds (as described above).

8. Credit fundamentals are making a comeback
Damien McCann, fixed income portfolio manager, American Funds® Multi-Sector Income Fund
Credit fundamentals may soon be back in the driver’s seat as inflation cools and rate hikes slow.
While consistent cash flows and strong balance sheets are always important, they become essential during periods of falling growth when corporate bonds are often impacted unevenly across industries and asset classes. Our analysts are focused on identifying companies that can deftly navigate such an environment.
For bond investors, finding companies that are inventing the next big thing is less important than determining if they can meet their debt obligations. For example, established social media companies may be facing stiff competition for younger users, but they are also very creditworthy when measured by profitability, free cash flow and relatively low debt levels.
Credit fundamentals vary greatly across individual industries and issuers
Source: Bloomberg Index Services Ltd. As of 12/31/22. Represents the top nine industries by market value within the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Investment Grade Index.
Today’s starting yields for higher income bond sectors such as investment grade (BBB/Baa and above), high yield, emerging markets and securitized debt offer attractive entry points for long-term investors. The total return opportunity is also more appealing compared to recent years, as these higher yields may help buffer bond market volatility.
Spreads for investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds may not scream “buy,” but our analysts are finding attractive valuations in select issuers and industries.

9. High-yield bonds are earning their name again
Shannon Ward, fixed income portfolio manager, American High-Income Trust®
At today’s yields, high-yield bonds can provide attractive income to an investor’s portfolio.
Yields in the neighborhood of 8% help provide a buffer against bond market volatility, so the likelihood of earning a positive return is higher. History shows that when high-yield bonds yielded in the 7% to 8% range, the average two-year annualized forward return was 9.2%, and the average three-year annualized forward return was 7.9%. Yields have also jumped for high-yield municipal bonds, whose tax-exempt status adds to their allure.
Strong returns typically followed periods of elevated yields
Source: Bloomberg Index Services Ltd. As of 12/31/22. Yield to worst is the lowest yield that can be realized by either calling or putting on one of the available call/put dates, or holding a bond to maturity. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
While we are aware of the possibility of a contraction, I don’t expect the same level of price volatility in the high-yield market that followed the global financial crisis or the onset of the pandemic. The U.S. high-yield bond market is higher quality now (as defined by credit ratings) with just 11% of bonds rated CCC-or-below (as of December 31, 2022) versus 20% in December 2007.

10. 60/40 portfolios are alive and well
Hilda Applbaum, equity portfolio manager, American Balanced Fund®
Ask your favorite search engine, “Is the 60/40 portfolio dead?” and it will generate about half a million results. Such skepticism is understandable following a year in which stocks and bonds both declined for the first time in decades. Despite the poor year, I believe the concept of a well-balanced portfolio — whether a 60/40 or 65/35 equity/fixed income split — is indeed alive and well.
For the first time in years, it’s possible to seek total returns in the high single digits by investing in core bonds and proven dividend-paying stocks without taking undue risk or reaching for yield. With the yield on the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index currently above 4%, many core bonds can provide a consistent return in the mid-single digits. That’s something we haven’t seen since 2008. Investors who are comfortable taking a little more risk by including investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds can look for their bond portfolios to potentially contribute even more.
Companies that pay a dividend can contribute to an attractive return picture with yields north of 3% and the potential for capital appreciation. For example, Broadcom has raised its dividend 12 consecutive years and had a 3.3% yield (as of December 31, 2022).
A balanced portfolio would have outpaced other strategies over the past 15 years
Sources: Capital Group, Bloomberg Index Services Ltd., FTSE Russell, ICE Benchmark Administration Ltd., MSCI, Refinitiv Datastream, Standard & Poor’s. As of 12/31/22. “Buy the dip” strategy represents buying the prior year’s worst performing asset class every year. “Ride the wave” strategy represents buying the prior year’s best performing asset class every year. ""Balanced portfolio"" strategy represents maintaining a 60/40 split between U.S. large cap stocks and U.S. aggregate bonds. Asset classes included in the analysis: cash (Bloomberg 1–3 Months U.S. Treasury Bill Index), developed international stocks (MSCI EAFE Index), emerging markets stocks (MSCI Emerging Markets Index), foreign bonds (Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index), global commodities (S&P GSCI), gold (LBMA Gold), U.S. equity REITs (FTSE USA REIT), U.S. high-yield bonds (Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High Yield Index), U.S. aggregate bonds (Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index), U.S. large cap stocks (S&P 500 Index), U.S. small cap stocks (Russell 2000), U.S. taxable municipal bonds (Bloomberg Taxable Municipal Bond Index). This assumes the portfolios are rebalanced annually. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
Traditional asset allocation is not a broken or failed strategy. It will always make sense to think about balance, diversification and risk. A one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t work for every investor. It’s about building portfolios from the bottom up that align with investor goals.

What’s not changing? The importance of long-term investing
Andrew Suzman, equity portfolio manager, EuroPacific Growth Fund®
My colleagues may be able to look at the future and imagine new products and emerging trends, but the investment theme closest to my heart is one that doesn’t change. Despite all the transformations in the world, I believe the nature of my job and focus as a portfolio manager will continue to be exactly the same.
In 2023, just as we did in 2013 and 2003, we will come upon individual companies that do interesting things. We’ll try to buy them at reasonable prices and hold them so that any returns we see may be better than if we were to buy every company. That is my true north.
Some companies will get it right, and some will get it wrong. Our job is to find those most likely to get it right and create wealth over time so that our investors may benefit. Not that we’ll be perfect, but I’m optimistic that we can get more companies right than wrong and continue to add value for our clients.

Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. Small-company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable. While not directly correlated to changes in interest rates, the values of inflation linked bonds generally fluctuate in response to changes in real interest rates and may experience greater losses than other debt securities with similar durations. The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds. Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer’s creditworthiness. If agency ratings differ, the security will be considered to have received the highest of those ratings, consistent with the fund’s investment policies.

199,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/reshoring-supply-chains-what-means-investors.html,Reshoring supply chains: What does it mean for investors?,Trade,"February 9, 2023","Of all the lessons learned during the pandemic — wash your hands thoroughly, avoid crowded elevators, working from home can be productive — perhaps the most consequential lesson for companies is now obvious in hindsight: Relying on single links in the global supply chain was a mistake.
Major components of the supply chain fractured during the COVID-19 crisis, resulting in shortages of everything from medical supplies and equipment to furniture and auto parts. Geopolitical events also entered the fray as U.S.-China tensions and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine underscored the risks of relying too much on one place for critical supplies, including energy, food and computer chips.
“With the rapid spread of globalization over the past few decades, companies moved their manufacturing operations to the cheapest and most efficient countries,” says Julian Abdey, a portfolio manager with The Growth Fund of America®.
“That was great for company profits and consumer prices,” he continues. “But what we found out more recently is that when supply chains get disrupted it can cause real problems. For example, Europe has realized it was too dependent on Russia for natural gas. And I think the same is true for other products like computer chips. The world is too dependent on Asia, and Taiwan in particular, for semiconductors.”

Reshoring replaces offshoring
Fast forward to 2023, and many companies — in some cases spurred by massive government subsidies — are taking big steps to diversify their supply chains, focusing on reliability and robustness over cost and efficiency. That means bringing some manufacturing back home, or “reshoring” and moving some of it to other countries.
The trend has raised questions about whether the world is moving into a period of de-globalization. However, based on trade activity in recent years, the new path looks more like a measured adjustment to global supply chains, partially interrupted by the pandemic and the 2007–2009 financial crisis.
Globalization marches on — at a different pace
Sources: Capital Group, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Bank. World trade is calculated as the sum of exports and imports of goods and services, and is represented above as a share of global gross domestic product. Trade data as of 2021.
“When we talk to companies and look at the data, we are not seeing what I would call de-globalization,” says Rob Lovelace, a portfolio manager with New Perspective Fund®. “I think it would be more accurate to call it a rewiring of global supply chains. And I don’t think it’s really all that dramatic when you consider the rapid growth of digital trade, which is harder to track using traditional metrics, as opposed to physical trade.”
In fact, there is ample evidence that many companies are becoming more global as they seek to create redundant supply chains. The poster child for this development is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company or TSMC, the world's largest semiconductor foundry. To expand its global reach, TSMC is building new manufacturing plants in Arizona and Japan. Semiconductors have become such a sensitive issue, given their use in the defense industry, that the U.S. government has placed aggressive restrictions on where and how they can be exported.
Other examples abound in the tech sector and elsewhere. Apple announced in September that it would start producing the iPhone 14 in India, adding to its manufacturing capabilities in China, the Czech Republic and South Korea among others. In the auto sector, Tesla added to its U.S. and China manufacturing hubs last year by opening its first European outpost in Gruenheide, Germany.
In the energy sector, Texas-based ECV Holdings has announced plans to build a power plant for industrial parks near Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, supplied primarily by U.S. liquified natural gas. Meanwhile, the list of U.S. companies establishing new manufacturing plants at home has grown dramatically in recent years to include General Motors, Intel and U.S. Steel — fueling hopes of an American industrial renaissance.
The China+1 strategy
Amid this drive to diversify supply chains, a common misconception is that China may be displaced as the world’s largest manufacturing base. Rather, many companies are shifting to a “China+1 strategy” by maintaining operations in China while adding new facilities elsewhere, says Winnie Kwan, a portfolio manager with New World Fund®. Incremental investments in China are likely to focus on serving mainly the domestic market, she notes, while additional investments in other locations cater to the rest of the world.
“A key question is whether the China+1 strategy will be scalable or not,” Kwan says. “Can you add a new plant in India or Mexico, for example, and scale up production as needed? Is the labor and power supply sufficient? Is logistics infrastructure in place? Can management handle the added complexity? Those are the questions I am focusing on as we research these developments and look for investment opportunities. Not every company is going to get it right.”
Indeed, the flow of incremental investments is an important metric for investors to track. According to a 2021 survey of foreign companies doing business in China conducted by AmCham Shanghai, the top destinations for redirected investments were Southeast Asia, Mexico, India and the United States. However, only 63 of the 338 companies surveyed said they had such plans, which suggests the process of reshoring may be slower and more deliberate than some market participants are expecting.
“It could take a decade for companies to fully transition,” she adds. “But the process has certainly started, and I think it will be one of the more important investment themes of the 2020s.”
Southeast Asia is well positioned for the rewiring of global supply chains
Source: AmCham Shanghai 2021 China Business Report, published September 22, 2021. Based on a survey of 338 foreign companies doing business in China. Of those companies, 63 said they were redirecting investments from China to other locations, including Southeast Asia, Mexico, India and the United States, among others.
Who benefits from reshoring?
With such a large undertaking, the investment implications are widespread across a number of sectors and geographies. Here are four areas expected to benefit from reshoring in the years ahead.
1. India Thanks to its proximity to China, a well-educated labor force, and a fast-growing, business-friendly economy, India may be the best-positioned country to capitalize on supply chain diversification. India’s government has taken bold steps to encourage the expansion of manufacturing operations, particularly in the smartphone space, where Apple works with contractors such as Foxconn to build the latest iPhones. The manufacturing sector is expected to accelerate over the next decade, driving growth in the Indian economy and boosting other industries such as banking, energy and telecommunications.
“India is arguably better positioned today than China was 20 years ago,” says Capital Group equity analyst Johnny Chan.
2. Mexico Similar to India, Mexico’s proximity to one of the world’s largest economies makes it an attractive base for expanded manufacturing and logistics operations. Many U.S. companies flocked there in the 1990s after the adoption of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). That process has only accelerated under a revamped trade deal, the U.S./Mexico/Canada Agreement (USMCA), ratified in 2020.
Mexico’s annual exports to the U.S. have increased sharply in recent years. Although much of that is due to the influence of American companies, China is also ramping up in Mexico. For example, Hisense Group, one of China’s largest appliance makers, is currently building a $260 million industrial park in Monterrey, aiming to produce refrigerators, washing machines and air conditioners for the U.S. market. In the auto sector, BMW and Nissan have also recently expanded their capabilities south of the border.
3. Automation providers One of the biggest hurdles to diversifying the world’s manufacturing capabilities is a chronic labor shortage, especially in developed economies. Automation powered by artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to provide an answer to this problem, says Mark Casey, a portfolio manager with The Growth Fund of America®. Many Asian countries are setting the trend with high rates of industrial automation, with the U.S. and Europe expected to follow. Both regions have room to grow, proving a bright outlook for top companies in the global robotics industry, including Japan’s Keyence, France’s Schneider Electric and Switzerland’s ABB Ltd. Amazon is also developing its own impressive AI-driven technology, Casey notes.
“Amazon has a new robotic picking-and-packing device called Sparrow that can grab more than 60 million different products and pack them into shipping boxes — completing each pick in a matter of seconds,” Casey says. “Just seven years ago Amazon’s experimental robots could handle only a small number of items, and each pick would take a couple minutes. I think this sort of technology is coming along sooner than we think, and I don’t see it accounted for in the stock prices of any major American or European company.”

4. Multinationals Although it may seem counterintuitive, the same multinational companies that benefited most from the rapid pace of globalization in the past may be best equipped to navigate the brave new world of re-globalization, says Jody Jonsson, also a portfolio manager with New Perspective Fund. The world’s largest and most dominant companies rose to that position for a reason — they often have the experience and resources to adapt to changing trade patterns better than smaller companies operating in single markets.
“In my view, well-managed multinational companies will remain global in their production facilities and customer bases, but they will increasingly build more local redundancy into their operations,” Jonsson says. “I call it ‘multi-localization.’ That includes bringing some parts of the supply chain back to the U.S., continuing to outsource other parts and establishing new production facilities in key areas throughout the world.
“If there is one lesson we’ve learned from the COVID crisis, it’s that companies must have diverse supply chains,” she adds. “We aren’t there yet, but the process is well underway.”

200,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/10-book-ideas-capital-investment-team.html,10 book ideas from Capital’s investment team,Demographics & Culture,"January 11, 2023","Stephen King once said: “Books are a uniquely portable magic.”
Many of our readers must agree because we’ve received numerous requests to publish a list of favorite books selected by Capital Group investment professionals during our monthly webinars.
So, here you have it, 10 titles borrowed directly from the bookshelves of our portfolio managers, analysts and economists:
1. Chip War
Political economist Matt Miller calls Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology, “A fascinating read that delves deep into the history of the computer chip, while also providing a sober view into the geopolitical struggle to control the strategically vital semiconductor industry. It’s a very timely book, particularly with all the concerns around China and Taiwan, and the way the U.S. is trying to bring semiconductor manufacturing back home.”
Not coincidentally, Chip War author Chris Miller (no relation to Matt) was recently featured on the Capital Ideas podcast. You can find the episode here.

2. The Art of Learning
Even if you haven’t read this book, you may be familiar with author Josh Waitzkin as the basis for the child chess prodigy in the movie Searching for Bobby Fischer. In The Art of Learning: An Inner Journey to Optimal Performance, Waitzkin shares with readers how he become one of the top chess players in the world as well as a martial arts champion — succeeding at two seemingly opposite endeavors.
Portfolio manager Alan Wilson says this is one of the few books that he enjoys re-reading. “It turns out, the author is really good at learning,” Wilson explains. “The way he atomizes learning, breaking things down into constituent parts, is something I want to regularly remind myself and others to do. If you ever get a gift from me, it will be this book.”
Literary love: Book sales are on the rise
Sources: Capital Group, U.S. Census Bureau Monthly Retail Trade Survey. The figures above reflect total retail sales for U.S. bookstores on a trailing 12-month basis. The periods on the x-axis refer to October 2020 to September 2021, and October 2021 to September 2022. Latest available data as of September 2022.
3. Thinking in Bets
Portfolio manager Cheryl Frank enjoyed Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke. The book is subtitled Making Smarter Decisions When You Don’t Have All the Facts. If that sounds a lot like investing, that’s because it is. The author focuses on getting comfortable with uncertainty and making decisions with the highest odds of success.
“Annie Duke was a poker champion, but she gives a lot of great advice about scenario analysis and understanding the difference between outcomes and decisions,” Frank says. “For all of us in the investment industry, I think there are huge lessons in her way of thinking.”
An avid reader, Frank also lauded Ready Player One — a science fiction novel by Ernest Cline that does a remarkable job of describing what the metaverse might look like sometime in the future.
4. Red Notice
Portfolio manager Jody Jonsson was talking to colleagues about Red Notice long before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. She attended Stanford business school at the same time as the author, Bill Browder, so she’s been following his career for years.
Red Notice is a true story about Browder’s experience investing in Russia and a subsequent deadly conflict with Russian President Vladimir Putin. When one of Browder’s colleagues was arrested and tortured to death, he embarked on a crusade to expose the crimes and corruption of Putin’s regime.
The book has gained renewed attention since the outbreak of the war, given the insight it provides into Russia’s political, financial and cultural environment.
“It's interesting from both a business perspective and a geopolitical perspective,” Jonsson explains. “And it's very timely given what's going on in the world right now.”
5. How the World Really Works
Portfolio manager Paul Benjamin closely follows the energy sector, so it may not be surprising to hear that his book choice is How the World Really Works by Vaclav Smil. The author and scientist has written dozens of books about energy and climate change, often sparking controversy with his views on fossil fuels and the limits of alternative energy sources.
“He’s basically trying to explain to everyone, ‘You’ve got to understand how things really work and the pace at which it is realistic to change the world,’” Benjamin says. In one example, Smil famously explains how each greenhouse grown tomato requires the equivalent of five tablespoons of diesel fuel to facilitate its production and delivery to market.
“The book is incredibly detailed and scientific, and it dispels a lot of myths,” Benjamin says. “As a general rule, I would say it makes one think that fossil fuels will have to be a required part of the energy mix for a long time, regardless of how much you might prefer to get rid of them.”
6. 21st Century Monetary Policy
Tongue in cheek, bond manager Pramod Atluri says, “I’m reading a real thriller. It’s a page turner. It'll make you laugh, and it'll make you cry. It’s called, 21st Century Monetary Policy by Ben Bernanke.”
Bernanke, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, penned this scholarly tome about the evolution of the Fed over the past 70 years, including a detailed assessment of the central bank’s unprecedented monetary stimulus measures launched during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“For anyone who's been active in the markets, this might give you PTSD,” Atluri warns. “But I think it’s important to look back on some of the crises that we've been through and how the Fed has navigated them. Looking ahead, Bernanke also writes about how the world has changed and how the Fed might have to change with it.”
7. Make Your Bed
Portfolio manager Caroline Randall selected Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life ... And Maybe the World by retired Navy Admiral William McRaven. The book, inspired by his 2014 commencement address at the University of Texas, outlines 10 principles he learned during Navy SEAL training. The title comes from his most famous line, “If you want to change the world, start by making your bed” — a small accomplishment that can help set the stage for more challenging achievements.
“I think his message is particularly relevant when it comes to navigating difficult financial markets,” Randall notes. “He explains that you must be your very best in the darkest moments, and that’s certainly true in our business as well.”
8. The Premonition
Author Michael Lewis is a popular choice among investment professionals, given his focus on the financial industry in The Big Short and Liar’s Poker, which was inspired by his experiences as a bond trader at Salomon Brothers in the 1980s.
In addition to those titles, portfolio manager Jason Smith enjoyed Lewis’ latest book, The Premonition, an unflinchingly critical look at the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I like anything by Michael Lewis,” Smith says. “If I need to get a suntan or just relax on the beach, I’ll usually pick up one of his books.”
9. The Anomaly
Looking for a bit of escapism after a brutal year in the financial markets? Part crime thriller, part sci-fi fantasy, The Anomaly tells the tale of a group of passengers on a mysterious flight from Paris to New York, exploring what their lives might have been if they had made different choices. Is it fate or free will that has led them to this pivotal point in time?
Often compared to TV classics such as The Twilight Zone and Black Mirror, The Anomaly by Hervé Le Tellier “provides a wonderful departure from reality,” says economist Jared Franz.
“I can’t take credit for finding it,” he admits. “Our macro research group has a book club, and it was given to me by a colleague. But I can say it’s a fantastic read, and a welcome respite from turbulent markets.”
10. Winterdance
To wrap it up, economist and dog lover Darrell Spence selected Winterdance: The Fine Madness of Running the Iditarod by Gary Paulsen. This outdoor adventure tells the true story of Paulsen’s 17-day run with his sled dogs in the legendary 1,000-mile race across the Alaskan wilderness.
“I read for pure enjoyment, so it tends to be books that have absolutely nothing to do with economics or investing,” Spence explains. “I figure we get enough of that each day working here. Winterdance is one of my favorite books because I love dogs, and it also really makes you wonder why anyone in their right mind would run that race. It’s a fascinating read. And, best of all, it’s not related to investing.”

201,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/economy-2023-differ-from-market-consensus.html,The economy in 2023: Where we differ from market consensus,Markets & Economy,"December 28, 2022","The wisdom of crowds can be powerful. But in times of heightened uncertainty, it can be helpful to understand potential risks.
At the moment, markets appear to be crystallizing around a hopeful outlook for 2023. Asset prices suggest inflation will begin to subside quickly, the Fed will become less hawkish and global growth won’t be much weaker than it has been.
However, monetary policy is fluid, geopolitical uncertainty is high and strong labor markets are being offset by weakness in housing and other areas. Together, this allows for a range of possible outcomes.
There are four contrarian scenarios in which our economists think current market consensus, as reflected in asset prices, may not be the most probable outcome. Jared Franz says the Fed will keep rates higher for longer, yet when the economy recovers, it will be stronger than prior rebounds. Meanwhile, Robert Lind argues that European policymakers will likely run looser fiscal policies and tolerate higher inflation. Stephen Green says the Chinese consumer will take time to rebound, and currency analyst Jens Søndergaard warns it's too early to call for the end of the dollar's bull run.
The views are those of the economist stated, and the views of individual portfolio managers and analysts may differ. 
1. The Fed will keep rates higher for longer
Jared Franz, U.S. economist
Current inflation dynamics are going to keep the heat on the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise rates more if it’s really serious about not repeating the mistakes of the 1960s and 1970s. Beyond the 50 basis point rate hike at the Fed’s December policy meeting, the market doesn’t think the central bank will ultimately go beyond 5%. Plus, the consensus view on U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), although more tempered of late, still calls for something close to a soft landing next year. In contrast, I believe the U.S. economy is likely to slip into a mild recession, contracting by about 2%.
While the Consumer Price Index — the main inflation gauge in the United States — has probably peaked, it’s not falling back to 2% anytime soon. Price pressures have migrated from the goods sector to services, where inflation tends to be structurally stickier. This means it will take time and effort to get those prices to cool down.
In addition, the labor market keeps chugging along with solid job and wage growth. It looks to me like wages could stay higher even through a recession. The U.S. labor force is getting older, and the labor participation rate decline seen during the pandemic shows few signs of rebounding. 
Market expects the Fed to stop hiking at 5%
Sources: Capital Group, Federal Reserve, FactSet. Data as of December 7, 2022.
Given these pressures, there is a real risk the Fed raises rates beyond 5%. I also don’t see a Fed pivot (rate cuts back down to 3% or 2%) unless the recession turns severe or financial markets show signs of breaking.
The Fed could stop raising rates at or below 5% in response to economic weakness. However, I see a decision to stop hiking sooner resulting in elevated rates for an even longer period.
Adding to my view that the Fed will stay higher for longer, I believe this recovery could be stronger than the past two recessions. The U.S. could be at the start of a strong capital spending cycle as manufacturing is reshored and supply chains are realigned over the next decade. Energy security and greater defense spending will also require greater investment in the years ahead. 
Thanks to the tight labor market, consumers could find themselves in better shape than they normally are at the end of a recession. As a result, consumer spending could pick up more quickly than typical.
2. European inflation pressures will persist
Robert Lind, Europe economist
According to the Bloomberg consensus, European economists are expecting consumer price inflation to slow from the recent year-over-year pace of 10% to 3.5% by the end of 2023, and close to 2% in 2024. But I’m skeptical inflation will fall quickly back to target for three reasons. 
First, I anticipate more persistent upward pressure on energy prices as Europe diversifies away from Russian oil and gas over the next few years. This move will likely result in a significant negative supply shock, effectively raising costs throughout the economy over a sustained period. This is likely to worsen the tradeoff between inflation and economic growth.
Second, I believe economic policymakers will tolerate higher inflation as the economy adjusts to a sharp decline in real incomes. The alternative for governments and central banks would be to drive economies into an even deeper recession. Given the sociopolitical pressures this would create, I think it’s more likely European governments will run looser fiscal policy to support their economies, which central banks will accommodate, effectively accepting higher inflation so long as inflation dynamics don’t become unstable, as they did in the 1970s. 
Third, I believe workers and companies have become more willing to accept price and wage increases, which will sustain inflationary pressures. Unions are pushing to grow wages in line with inflation in an environment of persistent labor shortages. Companies seem willing to concede some ground on wages, but they are looking to raise prices to address higher wages and other costs. This is a profound shift in behavior.
Headline inflation should peak over the next three to six months in the major European economies, but I expect only a gradual drop in inflation rates in 2023 and 2024. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England will continue to tighten policy in the short term, but they will face an increasingly challenging task of balancing above-target inflation against signs of more economic weakness.
3. China’s economy won’t see a strong rebound
Stephen Green, Asia economist
I’ve penciled in between 3% and 4% real GDP growth for China in 2023, compared with the International Monetary Fund’s 4.4% forecast. Even so, I expect the drag from zero-COVID restrictions will lessen, the housing market will bottom and China’s economy will get a modest lift from infrastructure spending.
It’s worth considering nominal GDP as well. Recent history shows China’s nominal GDP and earnings growth move together closely. The economic slowdown this year will contribute to weaker earnings growth. In 2023, I’m expecting 2.5% inflation, which puts my 2023 nominal growth expectation closer to 6%. This implies a modest improvement in year-over-year earnings, although some of this may be discounted in equity prices already. China’s economy and earnings could fall short next year and may not be able to spark a strong equity market recovery.
China’s growth and corporate earnings could disappoint

China will be challenged by a potential contraction in exports as well as the slump in the housing sector. In recent years, the property market has accounted both directly and indirectly for approximately 25% of the country’s GDP.
The earlier-than-expected U-turn in Beijing’s zero-COVID policy could stimulate at least a moderate rebound in consumer spending next year. However, the scale will depend on falling unemployment, which I expect to be slow. Household income, wage growth and borrowing have been weak, while consumer confidence is still low and unemployment numbers are elevated. Obviously zero-COVID policies weigh heavily on consumer confidence, but wage growth is an important driver of consumption.
The question is now how bad the winter COVID wave gets. Local governments will likely reintroduce some restrictions to help flatten the curve. Barring a health crisis with significant loss of life, I believe day-to-day activity in China can get close to normal by next spring. Even so, I don’t see economic growth reaching market expectations. 
4. The dollar’s imminent demise is unlikely
Jens Søndergaard, currency analyst
The recent U.S. dollar (USD) weakness looks more like a bear market rally or head fake to me. So far in the fourth quarter the dollar has weakened 7% against the euro and 6% against the yen, even though real rates in the bond market have not changed significantly. This tells me the bond market is not buying the more hopeful story (a Fed policy pivot, more China stimulus, better news from the Russia-Ukraine war) reflected in equity and currency markets. 
Interest rates don’t support the U.S. dollar’s recent retreat
Sources: Capital Group, J.P. Morgan, Bloomberg. Data as of December 6, 2022. Real interest rate difference is 10-year real interest rates of the U.S. minus the real rates of a developed market basket comprising Germany, Japan and the U.K.
I think the bond market stays rightfully focused on what’s been driving dollar movement in recent years: interest rate differentials. For me to believe the dollar’s persistent strength is nearing an end, I need to see a substantial change in both U.S. and non-U.S. real rates. The spread needs to compress. This is not happening yet.
It’s possible that U.S. Treasury 10-year real yields have peaked already. If so, it could remove an important USD support to the extent that a change in yields, rather than the absolute yield level, drives currency moves.  
As and when the dollar starts to lose some of its relative value, it could be especially pronounced against emerging markets (EM) currencies. Many EM central banks got a head start on hiking interest rates and have been more aggressive than their major developed market counterparts. As a result, EM real interest rates look more attractive relative to developed markets. But I think that is at least a year away. Despite the stronger fundamentals, a period of higher inflation and slower global economic growth is unlikely to be supportive of EM currencies.

202,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/courage-been-here-before.html,“Courage! We have been here before”,Market Volatility,"November 16, 2022","It’s déjà vu all over again. With inflation higher than it has been since the 1970s, interest rates rising and the economy slowing, many have grown fearful of investing.
The last time it felt this way was the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. I remember sharing with my colleagues a classic speech from former Capital Group chairman Jim Fullerton. This speech, delivered in November 1974 amid a prolonged bear market, provided us with much-needed historical perspective and a dose of optimism when it was in short supply.
The “Fullerton letter” as it has come to be known, has been recirculated among Capital Group’s investment team at least five times in my career. My former colleague, retired equity portfolio manager Claudia Huntington, shared it in 1987, saying, “I have been saving this speech, one of my favorites, for a time like today.”
I think it’s been shared so often because Jim captured so well what we all know: It is always darkest before the dawn. Over time, and in time, the financial markets have demonstrated a remarkable ability to anticipate a better tomorrow even when today’s news feels so bad.
The stock market has overcome past bear markets and unsettling news
Sources: RIMES, Standard & Poor’s. As of October 31, 2022. Chart shown on a logarithmic scale. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
We are once again in uncertain territory. It feels scary and terrible. It is exactly those feelings that make this speech so timeless. It’s precisely when the backdrop has looked so difficult that the markets have begun to recover. It’s hard to know when that turn will happen this cycle. But, based on prior experiences the market will turn eventually — and that should provide some solace.
In November 1974, few people thought it was a good time to invest. The Dow had lost more than 40% from its high in January 1973. In his letter, Fullerton recalled an even darker period in our nation’s history — April 1942. His remarks follow, and you can download a copy of the letter:
“We have been here before”
One significant reason why there is such an extreme degree of bearishness, pessimism, bewildering confusion, and sheer terror in the minds of brokers and investors alike right now, is that most people today have nothing in their own experience that they can relate to that is similar to this market decline.
My message to you, therefore, is: “Courage! We have been here before. Bear markets have lasted this long before. Well-managed mutual funds have gone down this much before. And shareholders in those funds and we the industry survived and prospered.”
I don’t know if we have seen the absolute bottom of this prolonged bear market, (although I think we’ve seen the lows for a lot of individual stocks).
Each economic, market and financial crisis is different from previous ones. But in their very difference, there is commonality. Namely, each crisis is characterized by its own new set of nonrecurring factors, its own set of apparently insoluble problems and its own set of apparently logical reasons for well-founded pessimism about the future.
Today there are thoughtful, experienced, respected economists, bankers, investors and businessmen who can give you well-reasoned, logical, documented arguments why this bear market is different; why this time the economic problems are different; why this time things are going to get worse — and hence, why this is not a good time to invest in common stocks, even though they may appear low.
Today people are saying: “There are so many bewildering uncertainties, and so many enormous problems still facing us — both long and short term — that there is no hope for more than an occasional rally until some of these uncertainties are cleared up. This is a whole new ballgame.”

A whole new ballgame
In 1942 everybody knew it was a whole new ballgame. And it sure as hell was. Uncertainties? We were all in a war that we were losing. The Germans had overrun France. The British had been thrown out of Dunkirk. The Pacific Fleet had been disastrously crippled at Pearl Harbor. We had surrendered Bataan, and the British had surrendered Singapore. The U.S. was so ill-prepared for a war that the cavalry school at Fort Riley was still teaching equitation, and I would guess that probably 75% of our field artillery was equipped with horse-drawn, French 75mm guns, Model 1897 (including the battalion in which I was then serving).
In April 1942, inflation was rampant. A Federal Reserve bulletin stated: “General price increases have become a grave threat to the efficient production of war materials and to the stability of the national economy.”
Today there is concern about the slump in housing construction. On April 8, 1942, the lead article in the Journal was: “Home construction. Total far behind last year’s; new curbs this week to cut further … Private builders hard hit.”
Today almost every financial journal or investment letter carries a list of reasons why investors are standing on the sidelines. They usually include (1) continued inflation; (2) illiquidity in the banking system; (3) shortage of energy; (4) possibility of further outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East; and (5) high interest rates. These are serious problems.
But on Saturday, April 11, 1942 (remember when the exchanges were open on Saturday?), The Wall Street Journal stated: “Brokers are certain that among the factors that are depressing potential investors are, (1) widening defeats of the United Nations; (2) a new German drive on Libya; (3) doubts concerning Russia’s ability to hold when the Germans get ready for a full-dress attack; (4) the ocean transport situation with the United Nations, which has become more critical; and (5) Washington is again considering either more drastic rationing with price fixing or still higher taxes as a means of filling the ‘inflationary gap’ between increased public buying power and the diminishing supply of consumer goods.” (Virtually all of these concerns were realized and got worse.)
On the same day, discussing the slow price erosion of many groups of stocks, a leading stock market commentator said: “The market remains in the dark as to just what it has to discount. And as yet, signs are still lacking that the market has reached permanently solid ground for a sustained reversal.”
Yet on April 28, 1942, in that gloomy environment, in the midst of a war we were losing, faced with excess profits taxes and wage and price controls, shortages of gasoline and rubber and other crucial materials, and with the virtual certainty in the minds of everyone that once the war was over we’d face a post-war depression in that environment, the market turned around.
A return to reality
What turned the market around in April of 1942?
Simply a return to reality. Simply a slow but growing recognition that despite all the bad news, despite all the gloomy outlook, the United States was going to survive, that strongly financed, well-managed U.S. corporations were going to survive also. The reality was that those companies were far more valuable than the prices of their stocks indicated. So, on Wednesday, April 29, 1942, for no apparent visible reason, investors again began to recognize reality.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is not reality. Reality is not price-to-earnings ratios and technical market studies. Symbols on the tape are not the real world. In the real world, companies create wealth. Stock certificates don’t. Stock certificates are simply proxies for reality.
Now I’d like to close with this:
“Some people say they want to wait for a clearer view of the future. But when the future is again clear, the present bargains will have vanished. In fact, does anyone think that today’s prices will prevail once full confidence has been restored?”
That comment was made 42 years ago by Dean Witter in May of 1932 — only a few weeks before the end of the worst bear market in history.
Have courage! We have been here before — and we’ve survived and prospered.

203,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/new-reality-investors-5-major-shifts.html,New reality for investors: 5 big trends changing markets,Global Equities,"November 2, 2022","There’s a new reality taking shape in global markets.
Commentators have in the last few months mostly focused on a rotation from growth to value, but I think that view is too simplistic. I see many shifts happening simultaneously that could likely define the next decade in markets around the world.
Many investors are expecting a return to normal after inflation subsides and central banks stop raising rates. But I believe the world is undergoing significant changes and that investors will need to reset their expectations about how a typical investing environment will look. Here are five seismic shifts happening in economies and markets right now, as well as the long-term investment implications of each:
1. From falling rates to rising rates and higher inflation
The market is grappling with a macro environment it hasn’t seen in a long time. Inflation is its highest since the early 1980s. And until recently we've had 40 years of declining interest rates. That’s longer than most investment managers’ careers, if not lifetimes. That’s part of the reason we see a market struggling to adjust to this new reality.
Is this the end of a 40-year disinflation cycle?
Sources: Capital Group, Refinitiv Datastream. As of 10/26/22.
It’s easy to assume these are market dislocations that will quickly reverse — bond markets are currently pricing a return to 2% inflation within two years, for example. But these cycles often last much longer than people anticipate, and there is reason to believe higher inflation is structural and likely to persist.
In this new environment I’m especially cautious of highly levered companies, or those raising new debt. Money isn’t “free” anymore, so a larger slice of earnings will go to service debt. Companies with the ability to fund their own growth as well as those with strong pricing power and dependable cash flows will remain attractive in a high-inflation, higher-cost-of-capital world.

2. From narrow to broader market leadership
I think we're going to be in a much less narrowly concentrated market going forward. The last decade was dominated by a handful of tech stocks that you basically had to own to keep up with the market. I don't think that's going to be the case anymore.
I expect opportunities to arise from a variety of companies, industries and geographies. Well-managed companies beyond the tech sector may have their chance to shine again.
For example, e-commerce companies have gone from being the disruptors to being challenged themselves. They’re often very low margin and expensive to scale with difficult delivery logistics to manage. Very few have done it well. Some traditional retailers that have combined the benefits of brick-and-mortar stores with a compelling online shopping experience are starting to take share from pure e-commerce companies.
Market leaders are becoming less concentrated
Sources: Capital Group, Refinitiv Datastream, Standard & Poor's. As of September 30, 2022. Indexed to 100 as of 1/1/05.
After the market’s dive in 2020, I expected leadership to broaden, and it has done so. In my view, this is a healthy development and supports why I have been trying to de-concentrate my own portfolios. In theory, it should be a positive backdrop for stock pickers over indexers.
3. From digital to physical assets
The last bull market was dominated by tech companies that made their fortunes on digital assets, such as online marketplaces, streaming platforms, search engines and social media. This overshadowed the fact that you can’t build a new economy without older industries. Not that digital-first companies are going away, but I think investors will start to place greater emphasis on commodities and producers of physical assets.
Capital spending super cycle could power a new industrial renaissance
Sources: Capital Group, FactSet, MSCI. In current U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2021.
Some might assume that trends like the shift to renewable energy will squeeze out incumbents in traditional sectors like industrials, materials or energy. On the contrary, there may be winners among businesses that are helping other companies be more energy efficient — whether that's smart buildings, power management or HVAC systems that reduce gas emissions. Other global trends such as grid modernization, reshoring and energy security may cause a boom in capital investment across industries. These are areas where smartly managed industrial companies might have a real renaissance.
4. From multiple expansion to earnings growth
Many newer investors got comfortable with stocks being very expensive over the last five to 10 years and now assume stocks will return to those levels during the next bull market. When rates were near zero the market could support loftier multiples, but I think those days are over.
An exercise I’m trying to apply when evaluating my portfolio is to ask: “What if stocks don’t return to 25x earnings in 2027? What if they only trade at 15x earnings?” If I can make a stock work at that level, then I can probably limit my downside. Using that lens, I'm trying to find emerging and growth-oriented companies that are not valued as such. I like those that may also offer potential upside to the valuation, but where the investment thesis doesn’t depend on it.
If multiple expansion is limited in the next bull market, stock returns will have to be powered by earnings growth. That means markets aren’t likely to be as patient with unprofitable companies. Stocks whose business models depend on cheap money are going away. Companies that funded losses while trying to scale rapidly even where the economics didn’t work are going away. Markets once paid up heavily for future growth, but now with higher interest rates they are less willing to do so. The market is calling time on business models that don’t work when money is no longer free.
5. From global supply chains to regional supply chains
The globalization of supply chains is another multi-decade trend that is shifting. For a generation, companies moved manufacturing to foreign soil to cut costs and boost margins. But the limitations of placing efficiency over resilience are now clear. Rising geopolitical tension and pandemic-induced disruptions have led companies to consider bringing supply chains closer to home.
While bottlenecks caused by COVID shutdowns have improved, many companies are still being impacted. The auto industry is a prime example. Major automakers have tens of thousands of unfinished cars waiting for final parts, and that missing component is often as minor as an inexpensive semiconductor chip. Now companies are creating supply chain redundancies so that a single disruption doesn’t derail their entire operation.
Even as pandemic-related issues ease, I believe increased geopolitical conflicts are here to stay and will continue to fuel this change. The current environment reminds me of the 1970s, with tension between Russia and the West, more aggressive confrontations with China, the rise of authoritarian leaders around the world and less global cooperation. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, we’ve had more than 30 generally peaceful and prosperous years. But there are more risks now, and this backdrop suggests lower valuations are warranted and “surprises” should feel less surprising.
Higher global tensions have increased risk of relying on international supply chains
Sources: Capital Group; Caldara, Dario and Matteo Iacoviello (2022), “Measuring Geopolitical Risk,” American Economic Review, April, 112(4), pp.1194-1225. The Geopolitical Risk Index is a measure of adverse geopolitical events and associated risks based upon the tally of newspaper articles covering geopolitical tensions, using a sample of 10 newspapers going back to 1985. Index level values reflect a 12-month smoothed average of monthly data. As of September 2022.
Consider Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s dominant manufacturer of cutting-edge semiconductors. After having concentrated the bulk of its capacity in Taiwan — a focal point of geopolitical concerns — the company is building its first manufacturing hub in the United States. It’s also constructing a new plant in Japan. That regionalization should create a more efficient supply chain for some of its top U.S.-based clients, including automakers and technology companies like Apple, Qualcomm and Broadcom.
A flexible investment approach can help weather the storm
The combination of low rates and rising markets made the last 10 years feel like one long sunny day at the beach. While some rain showers have now driven beachgoers indoors, they’re still looking out the window waiting for the storm to pass. They don’t realize that there’s a new weather system upon us with more clouds, colder temperatures and much stronger winds. The world’s not ending, but it may be a wetter, cloudier and colder place — and life won’t be a day at the beach.
Flexible funds can pivot between sectors as market conditions shift
Source: Capital Group. Data from 1/1/19 to 6/30/22. 2022 data is year to date. Totals are arithmetic sums of each year.
That may sound like a dark outlook, but I actually see this as a really exciting time to be an investor. As a portfolio manager for New Perspective Fund®, which is not restricted by geographies, sectors or style boxes, my fellow managers and I are able to adjust to this new reality of investing in a variety of ways.
The chart above shows that flexibility in action. Although we didn’t get everything right, we have been shifting from higher growth sectors like consumer discretionary and information technology to health care and industrials over the past few years in anticipation of this new reality. New market environments present new opportunities, and that’s where experience and flexibility can be essential.

204,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/us-midterm-elections-will-house-flip.html,U.S. midterm elections: Will the House flip?,Election,"October 20, 2022","The buzz surrounding the U.S. midterm elections has picked up recently as pundits suggest the Republican Party may not win back the House of Representatives in a “red wave” widely expected just a few months ago.
My view: I still expect the GOP to win the House. That’s been my position since early in President Biden’s term — even before inflation rose to 40-year highs and Americans started worrying about a potential recession. The Senate, meanwhile, remains a toss-up that I think could go either way as races tighten in a number of key states.
I must stress, this is analysis not advocacy. It’s my job to advise Capital Group’s investment team on political and policy issues, and I strive to do so without bias or partisanship of any kind.
If I am right about the outcome of the November 8 elections, a Republican victory will mark the end of the affirmative phase of Biden’s presidency. From an investment point of view, flipping the House is really all that matters. With Republicans holding the purse strings, there would be no chance of passing ambitious legislation related to taxes, climate change or labor policy until at least 2025.
Democrats control the House by a slim margin. Is that about to change?
Sources: Capital Group, 270toWin, Cook Political Report, Office of Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives. Number of competitive districts is the total number of upcoming House elections defined by 270toWin as either ""likely,"" ""leans,"" ""tilt,"" or ""toss-up,"" based on current consensus estimates from eight polling sources including Cook Political Report, FiveThirtyEight, Inside Elections, Fox News, Politico, Split Ticket, Elections Daily and Sabato's Crystal Ball. As of October 14, 2022.
It is true that Democrats have scored some legislative wins recently. They have also gained a degree of political momentum from the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision establishing federal abortion rights, as well as former President Trump’s legal woes. These events have given rise to a “comeback” narrative in the press that has led some outlets to argue that the House can be held.
I don’t believe it. Here’s why:
1. Republicans don’t need much
They must flip just five seats to win a majority in the House. Historically speaking, in the first midterm of a presidency, the opposition party wins many more than that.
2. Biden’s low approval rating is a bad sign
It’s ticked up from 38% in polling averages to the low 40s. If he rises to the high 40s or 50%, that might make a difference, but I’m skeptical he can get there in the short amount of time left. The low 40s is a very bad place to be going into a midterm election. As other analysts have noted, this is roughly where Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Trump were at the same point in their presidencies. They lost 26, 52, 63 and 40 House seats in their first midterms, respectively.

3. The tightening “generic ballot” is misleading
Many observers rightly note that the “generic ballot” has tightened. This involves a common question pollsters ask about which party respondents would support if the election were held today, as opposed to which specific candidate. Looking at recent polling averages, Democrats have gained a one-point edge in the generic ballot, compared to a 2.5% deficit in early May.
That sounds like progress, and it is. But remember that in 2020 Democrats had a 7.3% lead in the generic ballot going into election day and Republicans picked up 14 House seats, contrary to the “blue wave” many were expecting. This understatement of GOP House support in polling also happened in 2014 and 2016.

4. Even respected “gurus” have been wildly wrong
The Cook Political Report is often seen as the leading election forecaster in Washington, D.C. I know and respect the people who run this organization. It caused a ripple last month when they moved five races in the Democrats’ direction and asserted that a GOP House win is “no longer a foregone conclusion.”
Commentators seizing on this latest call forget how wrong Cook was in 2020, when their final House call was that Democrats were poised to expand their majority by 10 to 15 seats — only to see Republicans gain 14. That’s a big miss. The work of experienced political analysts in Washington is useful input for assessing the race, but hardly the final word.
U.S. stocks have historically done well when Congress is split
Sources: Capital Group, Strategas. As of 12/31/21. Unified government indicates White House, House and Senate are controlled by the same political party. Unified Congress indicates House and Senate are controlled by the same party, but the White House is controlled by a different party. Split Congress indicates House and Senate are controlled by different parties, regardless of White House control. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
To be clear, I think this latest comeback narrative is a function of the national media’s thirst for a change in the story line. The Democrats are also moving aggressively to try to make the midterms more of a “choice,” and not just a referendum on the president. But as I read their work, thoughtful political analysts — even on the left — are mostly acknowledging that the House outlook remains firmly in the GOP’s favor.
What if Republicans win the House and the Senate?
That would probably result in some epic confrontations between Congress and the White House — including a potential showdown over a middle-class tax cut. Could Biden and the Democrats realistically oppose a tax cut for everyday folks as the presidential election approaches? It would be a tough call.
No doubt, such battle lines are already being drawn for 2024.

“It’s been a difficult year, and the pain may continue,” says Capital Group economist Darrell Spence. “But it’s important to keep in mind: One of the things that all past bear markets have had in common is that they eventually ended. Ultimately, the economy and the markets righted themselves.”
While past market results are not predictive of future results, it can be constructive to look at history. Based on the trajectory of past downturns, bear markets that were associated with a recession tended to last, on average, about 18 months, Spence notes. So it wouldn’t be unusual for this one to continue well into 2023.
With a recession looming in the U.S. — and probably already underway in Europe — it’s tough to see a catalyst for a near-term rebound, Spence says. Stocks and bonds are likely to come under further pressure as long as the Fed continues to aggressively tighten monetary policy in an attempt to curb inflation, which is hovering around 8%.
Stocks and bonds have tumbled this year as the Fed fights inflation
Sources: Capital Group, Bloomberg Index Services Ltd., Refinitiv Datastream, Standard & Poor’s. As of September 23, 2022.
Fed rate hikes shift into overdrive
Last week, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points for the third time since June. That hike brought the federal funds rate to a target range of 3.00% to 3.25%, the highest level since 2008. Based on the latest Fed projections, the central bank intends to take that rate above 4.50% in the months ahead.
Confirming the central bank’s hawkish stance, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said tighter financial conditions are necessary to achieve the goal of restoring price stability. That means bringing the inflation rate closer to the Fed’s 2% target.
“We have got to get inflation behind us,” Powell said during the Fed’s September 21 policy announcement. “I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn't.”
Financial assets have declined sharply since then, weighed down by the realization that the Fed and other central banks around the world may have to raise interest rates more than previously expected. The S&P 500 Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are all in bear market territory, defined as a decline of 20% or more from a recent high. The U.S. bond market, as represented by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index, is down about 14% on a year-to-date basis, as of September 23.

Mounting troubles in Europe
Markets have also come under pressure due to events outside the U.S., including Russia’s escalation of the war in Ukraine, an economic downturn in Europe and a controversial U.K. tax-cut proposal that has triggered fears of a fiscal crisis. U.K. bonds and the pound have plummeted since the plan’s unveiling on Friday.
A European recession may already be underway due to the impact of higher energy prices, which have been exacerbated by the war, according to Capital Group European economist Robert Lind. A harsh winter could make matters worse, sending energy prices even higher.
“The depth and duration of the recession will depend largely on two factors: the war and the weather,” Lind says. “Both of which are impossible to predict.”
At the same time, Lind adds, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have no choice but to continue raising interest rates since they face the same elevated inflation levels as the United States. He expects the ECB and the BoE to raise rates through the fall and winter months.
The Fed pivot
Looking ahead to 2023, investors will turn their focus to another key question: When will the Fed stop raising rates or even start cutting again?
At the moment, there is little pressure for the Fed to change course, says Capital Group economist Jared Franz. Consumer spending is relatively healthy. The U.S. job market is extremely strong. And the unemployment rate remains near a record low of 3.7%.
But when the unemployment number starts moving higher — as it typically would during a recession — Fed officials will be forced to choose between fighting inflation and pushing millions of Americans out of work, Franz explains.
“It’s easy to talk tough on inflation when your unemployment rate is under 4%,” Franz says. “But what happens when it climbs to 6% or 7%? In my view, that’s about as much pain as the Fed is willing to accept. At the current pace of rate hikes, we’re on course to hit 7% unemployment in the second half of next year. I think it would be very tough to keep monetary policy tight in that environment.”

207,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/is-high-inflation-ultimate-pandemic-distortion.html,Is high inflation the ultimate pandemic distortion?,Inflation,"September 22, 2022","The last time U.S. inflation spiked above 9%, Ronald Reagan was the newly elected president of the United States. IBM was selling its first personal computer using Microsoft software. And stainless steel DeLorean sports cars were rolling off the production line.
Perhaps that’s why 2022, in some ways, feels like taking a trip back in time. High inflation, rising interest rates, a bruising bear market and a proxy war with Russia seem all too familiar to anyone who lived through the early 1980s.
Today’s market environment, however, has been shaped by an entirely different event. The COVID-19 pandemic and, crucially, the response to the pandemic have created large distortions in the economy and markets — from sky-high inflation to chronic labor shortages to broken supply chains. 
Which of these COVID distortions will fade over time and which will remain long term? That is a key question for investors.
“There are some aspects of the pandemic that are fleeting and some that will persist,” says Alan Wilson, a portfolio manager for Washington Mutual Investors Fund SM. “That’s the issue we are grappling with today. We need to get the answer right because it will likely determine which companies thrive in a post-COVID world and which fall behind.”
Why is inflation so high?
With elevated inflation representing the most impactful distortion, a team of Capital Group portfolio managers, analysts and economists decided to study consumer price levels in 22 countries in relation to the growth of the money supply, or M2. (M2 is a broad measure of money that includes currency, coins, checking and savings deposits, as well as shares in money market funds.)
The team looked at many other COVID-related distortions, as well, some of which are covered in more detail below. But since inflation touches virtually all parts of the economy, it makes sense to start there.
Growth in the money supply has contributed to high inflation
Sources: Capital Group, Refinitiv Datastream. Money supply growth above is represented by the annual change in M2 (encompassing currency and coins held by the non-bank public, checkable deposits and travelers' checks, plus savings deposits, including money market deposit accounts, small time deposits and shares in retail money market mutual funds). Inflation figures above refer to the change in the consumer price index across selected countries. The original Capital Group analysis of this data included 22 countries or regions; some were removed from the chart for ease of reading. Inflation figures are current as of August or July of 2022, reflecting the latest available data as of September 14, 2022.
As it turns out, the basic laws of economics proved correct.
A rapidly growing money supply — boosted by pandemic-era government stimulus measures, aggressive bank lending and ultra-low interest rates — coincided with drastically higher inflation. In other words, the countries that stimulated the most during the pandemic generally wound up with the highest rates of inflation.
In fact, one could argue that today’s high inflation is not the biggest distortion, but rather it was the unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus undertaken by the United States and Europe, among others, says Julian Abdey, a portfolio manager with The Growth Fund of America®.
“I am reminded of the famous Milton Friedman quote: ‘Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon,’” Abdey notes. “In other words, inflation is caused by too much money chasing after too few goods, and that is exactly what we are seeing today.”

Has inflation peaked?
In June, U.S. headline inflation hit 9.1% on an annual basis — the highest level since 1981. That may be near the peak, Abdey explains, and while there could be lags, what’s important is that the Federal Reserve and many other central banks are now moving fast to tighten monetary policy. That should eventually bring inflation down. In addition, most governments are no longer sending pandemic support payments to businesses and individuals.
Does this mean inflation could return to the 2% level that has long been the Fed’s target?
“That is highly dependent on the Fed’s response going forward,” Abdey adds. “I can see different scenarios, including a more inflationary one, as well as the possibility of a return to deflation. If the Fed remains hawkish and tightens too much, that could result in a nasty recession. On the other hand, if it reverses course, then high inflationary expectations could become embedded into the real economy.”
So far, the hawkish stance is prevailing. On Wednesday, September 21, the Fed announced it would raise interest rates by another 75 basis points, bringing the federal funds rate to a target range of 3.00% to 3.25%, the highest level since 2008.
There are signs that inflation is starting to retreat. In the U.S., the August inflation reading declined to 8.3% — still a high number historically speaking, but significantly below the 9.1% reading in June.
Volatile energy prices, a main contributor to inflation, appear to have peaked over the summer and are now moving lower. U.S. gasoline prices, for example, have declined by roughly 25% over the past three months. Food prices, however, continue to rise sharply, along with prices for new cars, housing, electricity and medical care.
Energy price increases are moderating, easing inflationary pressures
Sources: Capital Group, The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Inflation above reflects the OECD's consumer price index for G-7 countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Inflation is measured in terms of the annual growth rate in the index, using 2015 as the base year with a breakdown for food, energy and total excluding food and energy. As of July 2022.
The great resignation
Another COVID distortion that remains entrenched is the severe labor shortage. In 2021, a popular media narrative developed around the idea of “the great resignation,” inspired by U.S. government data showing that roughly 47 million people voluntarily quit their jobs that year and seemed to disappear from the workforce.
Further data and myriad surveys helped shed light on the reasons. Many quit to ultimately take better-paying jobs. Some older workers opted for early retirement. And roughly 600,000 Americans decided to start their own small businesses, a trend which is hard to track through monthly employment data.
So why is the labor market still extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a record low of 3.7%? That’s because the U.S. economy — and many other developed economies around the world — have not kept up with pre-pandemic growth trends, says Capital Group economist Jared Franz.
“Given the average annual growth in the labor force pre-COVID, we should have four to five million more workers than we have today,” Franz estimates.
Labor crunch: Where did the employees go?
Sources: Capital Group, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Refinitiv Datastream, U.S. Department of Labor. Labor force participation rate above reflects the monthly total U.S. civilian labor force participation rate; the five-year average includes the average monthly participation rate between February 2015–February 2020; the post-Covid average reflects the average monthly participation rate between March 2020–August 2022.
This imbalance in the labor force hit some industries harder than others, particularly those most affected by the pandemic-era lockdowns. Those include travel, hospitality, manufacturing and education. The labor imbalance also has significant implications for the Fed’s rate-hiking path, given the central bank’s desire to cool down the red-hot job market, which adds to inflation through wage increases.
“If these shifts in the labor force persist,” Franz notes, “it would require more rate hikes than the market has priced in today — and for a longer period of time — to realign labor supply and demand.”
Over the long term, Franz believes the labor crunch will ease, especially if the U.S. economy falls into recession over the next year or two. But that’s a painful way to solve the problem, he concedes.
“Unfortunately, it does sometimes take a significant downturn to resolve imbalances in the economy,” Franz says.
Stocks and bonds falling
Among all the major distortions in the economy and markets today, this one strikes at the heart of portfolio diversification.
Simply put, when stocks zig, bonds are supposed to zag. Yet that has yet to happen in 2022. Both major asset classes are coming under pressure as high inflation and rising interest rates hurt growth-oriented stocks as well as many types of corporate and government bonds.
As of August 31, the S&P 500 Index has lost about 16% on a year-to-date basis, while the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index, which represents the U.S. investment-grade (rated BBB/Baa and above) bond market, has declined more than 11%. On a total return basis, that hasn’t happened in more than 45 years — a period that includes the 1994 bond market meltdown, the early 2000s dot-com implosion and the 2007–09 global financial crisis.
U.S. stocks and bonds rarely decline in tandem
Sources: Capital Group, Bloomberg Index Services Ltd., Standard & Poor's. Returns above reflect annual total returns for all years except 2022, which reflects the year-to-date total return for both indexes. As of August 31, 2022.
The entire relationship hinges on inflation.
If the Fed can get consumer prices under control, the historically negative correlation between stocks and bonds should return, explains Pramod Atluri, principal investment officer of The Bond Fund of America®. 
“That is the trillion-dollar question,” Atluri says. “Are we in a new higher inflation regime or not? I don’t think we are. In my view, we are likely to see inflation come down as the Fed and other central banks continue to raise interest rates and reduce their balance sheets.”
This painful experience, however, could have a long-term impact on the markets by affecting the willingness of governments and central banks to intervene during future times of crisis, Atluri adds.
“In my view, there will be less monetary and fiscal support over the next decade as policymakers assess what went wrong,” he adds. “That would be a big shift from what we’ve experienced over the past decade, which was largely defined by government intervention. Less intervention will likely result in more volatile markets than investors have been accustomed to.”
Silver-lining distortions
Not all COVID distortions necessarily carry a negative connotation. In the equity markets, post-pandemic opportunities are emerging in a number of areas, says Nick Grace, a portfolio manager with EuroPacific Growth Fund®.
Those areas include what Grace likes to call “structural changes,” including the transition from traditional energy sources to more sustainable sources; years of underinvestment in commodities, which could lead to a new commodities super cycle; and big industrial shifts, such as the increasing adoption of automation, resulting in greater demand for semiconductors.
He is also watching certain badly bruised tech and consumer-tech companies, including some of the darlings of the COVID lockdowns that have since sharply sold off. The remarkable pull-forward in demand that we saw during the lockdowns has proven to be a fleeting moment in time, rather than a new paradigm, and share prices are starting to reflect that reality.
“A lot of the price distortions we saw in 2020 and 2021 are being unwound,” Grace says, “which doesn’t mean they can’t fall further. But there’s already been a great deal of price destruction, and I think a lot of the excesses have been wrung out of the market.”
Over the next few years, Grace stresses, this is where traditional stock-picking skills will make all the difference.
“Many of these companies won’t survive,” he explains, “but a handful will come out of this downturn stronger and more profitable. It’s our job to identify them through fundamental bottom-up research, and I feel confident about our ability to do it.”

208,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/guide-to-recessions.html,Guide to recessions: 9 key things you need to know,Market Volatility,"September 15, 2022","How bad will the next recession be?
That's one of the questions we hear most often, especially now as the Federal Reserve aggressively hikes interest rates to rein in inflation at 40-year highs. It seems clear to us that the U.S. will enter a recession by early 2023, if it hasn’t already. Our expectation is that it will be less damaging than the 2008 global financial crisis, but the full extent of the economic impact won’t be known for some time.
To help you prepare for these uncertain times, we researched 70 years of data including the last 11 economic downturns to distill our top insights and answer key questions about recessions:
1. What is a recession?
2. What causes recessions?
3. How long do recessions last?
4. What happens to the stock market during a recession?
5. What economic indicators can warn of a recession?
6. Are we in a recession?
7. How should you position your stock portfolio for a recession?
8. How should you position your bond portfolio for a recession?
9. What should you do to prepare for a recession?
1. What is a recession?
A recession is commonly defined as at least two consecutive quarters of declining GDP (gross domestic product) after a period of growth, although that isn’t enough on its own. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), which is responsible for business cycle dating, defines recessions as ""a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production and wholesale-retail sales."" In this guide, we will use NBER’s official dates.
2. What causes recessions?
Past recessions have occurred for many reasons, but typically are the result of economic imbalances that, ultimately, need to be corrected. For example, the 2008 recession was caused by excess debt in the housing market, while the 2001 contraction was caused by an asset bubble in technology stocks. An unexpected shock such as the COVID-19 pandemic, widespread enough to damage corporate profits and trigger job cuts, also can be responsible.
When unemployment rises, consumers typically reduce spending, which further pressures economic growth, company earnings and stock prices. These factors can fuel a vicious cycle that topples an economy. Although they can be painful to live through, recessions are a natural and necessary means of clearing out excesses before the next economic expansion.
As Capital Group vice chair Rob Lovelace recently noted, “You can’t have such a sustained period of growth without an occasional downturn to balance things out. It’s normal. It’s expected. It’s healthy.”

3. How long do recessions last?
The good news is that recessions generally haven’t lasted very long. Our analysis of 11 cycles since 1950 shows that recessions have persisted between two and 18 months, with the average spanning about 10 months. For those directly affected by job loss or business closures, that can feel like an eternity. But investors with a long-term investment horizon would be better served looking at the full picture.
Recessions are painful, but expansions have been powerful
Sources: Capital Group, National Bureau of Economic Research, Refinitiv Datastream. Chart data is latest available as of 8/31/22 and shown on a logarithmic scale. The expansion that began in 2020 is still considered current as of 8/31/22 and is not included in the average expansion summary statistics. Since NBER announces recession start and end months, rather than exact dates, we have used month-end dates as a proxy for calculations of jobs added. Nearest quarter-end values used for GDP growth rates.
Recessions have been relatively small blips in economic history. Over the last 70 years, the U.S. has been in an official recession less than 15% of all months. Moreover, their net economic impact has been relatively small. The average expansion increased economic output by almost 25%, whereas the average recession reduced GDP by 2.5%. Equity returns can even be positive over the full length of a contraction since some of the strongest stock rallies have occurred during the late stages of a recession.

4. What happens to the stock market during a recession?
The exact timing of a recession is hard to predict, but it’s still wise to think about how one could affect your portfolio. Bear markets (market declines of 20% or more) and recessions (economic declines) have often overlapped — with equities leading the economic cycle by six to seven months on the way down and again on the way up.
Equities have typically peaked months before a recession, but can bounce back quickly
Sources: Capital Group, Federal Reserve Board, Haver Analytics, National Bureau of Economic Research, Standard & Poor's. Data reflects the average change in the S&P 500 Index and economic activity (using industrial production as a proxy) of all completed economic cycles from 1950 to 2021. The ""cycle peak"" refers to the highest level of economic activity in each cycle before the economy begins to contract. Both lines are indexed to 100 at each economic cycle peak and also indexed to 0 ""months before/after cycle peak"" on the x-axis. A negative number (left of the cycle peak) reflects the average change in each line in the months leading up to the cycle peak. The positive numbers (right of the cycle peak) indicate the average changes after the cycle peak.
Still, aggressive market-timing moves, such as shifting an entire portfolio into cash, can backfire. Some of the strongest returns can occur during the late stages of an economic cycle or immediately after a market bottom. A dollar cost averaging strategy, in which investors systematically invest equal amounts at regular intervals, can be beneficial in down markets. This approach can allow investors to purchase more shares at lower prices while remaining positioned for when the market eventually rebounds.

5. What economic indicators can warn of a recession?
Wouldn’t it be great to know ahead of time when a recession is coming? Despite the impossibility of pinpointing the exact start of a recession, there are some generally reliable signals worth watching closely in a late-cycle economy.
Source: Capital Group. Reflects latest data available as of 8/31/22.
Many factors can contribute to a recession, and the main causes often change. Therefore, it’s helpful to look at several different aspects of the economy to better assess where excesses and imbalances may be building. Keep in mind that any indicator should be viewed more as a mile marker than a distance-to-destination sign.
Four examples of economic indicators that can warn of a recession include the yield curve, unemployment rate, consumer sentiment and housing starts. Aggregated metrics, such as The Conference Board Leading Economic Index® (LEI), which combines 10 different economic and financial signals into a single analytic system to predict peaks and troughs, have also been consistently reliable over time.
These factors suggest the U.S. is in a late part of the economic cycle and moving closer to a recession, even as the labor market remains relatively resilient. New economic data can quickly change the story though.

6. Are we in a recession?
Although it may feel like we’re already in one, we believe an official recession is still unlikely until later this year or early 2023. Despite the impact that high inflation has had on consumer sentiment and corporate earnings, a strong labor market continues to support the economy in the near term.
The likelihood of a recession rose sharply in recent months
Sources: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Refnitiv Datastream. As of 8/31/22. Shaded bars represent U.S. recessions as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
The exact timing will likely depend on the pace and magnitude of the Fed’s moves. It is hard to see a clear path to bring inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target without pushing the economy into recession. In our view, the only way to break the spiral of escalating wages and prices is to create a lot of slack in the labor market. The unemployment rate may need to rise to at least 5% or 6% before wage growth starts to moderate. We believe this will make a recession very difficult to avoid by 2023.
Geopolitical shocks — such as an escalation in the war in Ukraine — or the consequences of a recession overseas are even harder to predict but could quicken the timeline for a U.S. recession.

7. How should you position your stock portfolio for a recession?
We’ve already established that equities often do poorly during recessions but trying to time the market by selling stocks is not suggested. So should investors do nothing? Certainly not.
To prepare, investors should take the opportunity to review their overall asset allocation, which may have changed significantly during the bull market, to ensure their portfolio is balanced and diversified. Consulting a financial advisor can help immensely since these can be emotional decisions for many investors.
Through 10 declines, some sectors have finished above the overall market
*In September 2018, the telecommunication services sector was renamed communication services, and its company composition was materially changed. The dividend yield shown is for the telecommunication services industry group, a subset of the newly constructed communication services sector.
Sources: Capital Group, FactSet. Includes the last 10 periods that the S&P 500 Index declined by more than 15% on a total return basis. Sector returns for 1987 are equally weighted, using index constituents from 1989, the earliest available data set. The 2022 bear market is still considered current as of 8/31/22 and is included in this analysis. Dividend yields are as of 8/31/22.
Not all stocks respond the same during periods of economic stress. In the 10 largest equity declines between 1987 and August 2022, some sectors held up more consistently than others — usually those with higher dividends such as consumer staples and utilities. Dividends can offer steady return potential when stock prices are broadly declining.
Growth-oriented stocks can still have a place in portfolios, but investors may want to consider companies with strong balance sheets, consistent cash flows and long growth runways that can withstand short-term volatility.
Even in a recession, many companies may remain profitable. Focus on companies with products and services that people will continue to use every day such as telecom, utilities and food manufacturers with pricing power.

8. How should you position your bond portfolio for a recession?
Fixed income is often key to successful investing during a recession or bear market. That’s because bonds can provide an essential measure of stability and capital preservation, especially when equity markets are volatile.
The market selloff in the first half of 2022 was unique in that many bonds did not play their typical safe-haven role. But in the seven previous market corrections, bonds — as measured by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index — rose four times and never declined more than 1%.
High-quality bonds have shown resilience when stock markets are unsettled
Sources: Bloomberg Index Services Ltd., RIMES, Standard & Poor's. Dates shown for market corrections are based on price declines of 10% or more (without dividends reinvested) in the S&P 500 with at least 50% recovery persisting for more than one business day between declines. Includes all completed corrections between 1/1/10 and 8/31/22. Returns are based on total returns in USD. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
Achieving the right fixed income allocation is always important. But with the U.S. economy entering a period of uncertainty, it’s especially critical for investors to focus on core bond holdings that can provide balance to portfolios. Investors don’t necessarily need to increase their bond allocation ahead of a recession, but they should review their fixed income exposure with their financial professionals to be sure it is positioned to provide diversification from equities, income, capital preservation and inflation protection — what we consider the four key roles fixed income can play in a well-diversified portfolio.

9. What should you do to prepare for a recession?
Above all else, investors should stay calm when investing ahead of and during a recession. Emotions can be one of the biggest roadblocks to strong investment returns, and this is particularly true during periods of economic and market stress.
If you’ve picked up anything from reading this guide, it’s probably that determining the exact start or end date of a recession is not only impossible, but also not that critical. What is more important is to maintain a long-term perspective and make sure your portfolio is designed to be balanced enough to benefit from periods of potential growth before it happens, while being resilient during those inevitable periods of volatility.

209,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/midterm-elections-markets-5-charts.html,Can midterm elections move markets? 5 charts to watch,Election,"September 8, 2022","In a year when soaring inflation, the war in Ukraine and a bear market have commanded headlines, the U.S. midterm elections risked becoming an afterthought. But now the election is coming back into focus. And with good reason. Capital Group political economist Matt Miller believes 2022 could be one of the more consequential midterm elections in U.S. history.
“Make no mistake, every move in Washington this year has been carefully calculated with the midterms in mind,” Miller says.
But while control of Congress may be at stake, do midterm elections have any effect on equity markets?
To find out, we examined more than 90 years of data and found that the answer is yes, markets have behaved differently during midterm election years. Here are five things you need to know about investing in this political cycle.
1. The president’s party typically loses seats in Congress
Source: The American Presidency Project, ""Seats in Congress Gained/Lost by the President’s Party in Mid-Term Elections.”
Midterm elections occur at the midpoint of a presidential term and usually result in the president’s party losing ground in Congress. Over the past 22 midterm elections, the president’s party has lost an average 28 seats in the House of Representatives and four in the Senate. Only twice has the president’s party gained seats in both chambers.
Why is this usually the case? First, supporters of the party not in power usually are more motivated to boost voter turnout. Also, the president’s approval rating typically dips during the first two years in office, which can influence swing voters and frustrated constituents.
“The Senate remains a toss-up, but history suggests we will see a backlash against the party in power that will result in Republicans taking back control of the House,” Miller says. “As far as investors are concerned that would end any chance for ambitious Democratic legislation the next two years.”
Since losing seats is so common, it’s usually priced into the markets early in the year. But the extent of a political power shift — and the resulting policy impacts — remain unclear until later in the year, which can explain other trends we’ve uncovered.
2. Market returns tend to be muted until later in midterm years
Sources: Capital Group, RIMES, Standard & Poor’s. The chart shows the average trajectory of equity returns throughout midterm election years compared to non-midterm election years. Each point on the lines represents the average year-to-date return as of that particular month and day and is calculated using daily price returns from 1/1/31–12/31/21.
Our analysis of returns for the S&P 500 Index since 1931 revealed that the path of stocks throughout midterm election years differs noticeably compared to all other years.
Since markets typically rise over long periods of time, the average stock movement during an average year should steadily increase. But we found that in the first several months of years with a midterm election, stocks have tended to have lower average returns and often gained little ground until shortly before the election.

Markets don’t like uncertainty — and that adage seems to apply here. Earlier in the year there is less certainty about the election’s outcome and impact. But markets have tended to rally in the weeks before an election, and they have continued to rise after the polls close. So far, 2022 has been another example of a midterm election year with lackluster returns, although the impact of politics has been minimal compared to that of inflation and rising rates.
Despite the uncertainty, investors shouldn’t sit on the sidelines or try to time the market. The path of stocks varies greatly each election cycle, and the overall long-term trend of markets has been positive.
3. Midterm election years have had higher volatility
Sources: Capital Group, RIMES, Standard & Poor’s. As of 12/31/21. Volatility is calculated using the standard deviation of daily returns for each individual month. Standard deviation is a measure of how returns over time have varied from the average. A lower number signifies lower volatility. The chart shows median volatility for the S&P 500 Index for each month since 1970, displayed on an annualized basis.
Elections can be tough on the nerves. Candidates often draw attention to the country’s problems, and campaigns regularly amplify negative messages. Policy proposals may be unclear and often target specific industries or companies.
It may come as no surprise then that market volatility is higher in midterm election years, especially in the weeks leading up to Election Day. Since 1970, midterm years have a median standard deviation of returns of nearly 16%, compared with 13% in all other years.
“I don’t think this election will be any different,” says equity portfolio manager Chris Buchbinder. “There may be bumps in the road, and investors should brace for short-term volatility, but I don’t expect the election results to be a huge driver of investment outcomes one way or the other.”
4. Market returns after midterm elections have been strong
Sources: Capital Group, RIMES, Standard & Poor’s. Calculations use Election Day as the starting date in all election years and November 5th as a proxy for the starting date in other years. Only midterm election years are shown in the chart. As of 12/31/21.
The silver lining for investors is that markets have tended to rebound strongly in subsequent months, and the rally that has often started shortly before Election Day hasn’t been just a short-term blip. Above-average returns have been typical for the full year following the election cycle. Since 1950, the average one-year return following a midterm election was 15%. That’s more than twice the return of all other years during a similar period.
Of course every cycle is different, and elections are just one of many factors influencing market returns. For example, over the next year investors will need to weigh the impacts of a potential U.S. recession and global economic and geopolitical concerns.
5. Stocks have done well regardless of the makeup of Washington
Sources: Capital Group, Strategas. As of December 31, 2021. Unified government indicates control of the White House, House and Senate by the same political party. Unified Congress indicates control of the House and Senate by the same party, but control of the White House by a different party. Split Congress indicates control of the House and Senate by different parties, regardless of White House control.
There’s nothing wrong with wanting your preferred candidate to win, but investors can run into trouble if they place too much importance on election results. That’s because, historically, elections have had little impact on long-term investment returns.
In 2020, many investors feared the “blue wave” scenario, or Democratic sweep. But despite these concerns, the S&P 500 rose 42% in the 14 months following the 2020 election (from November 4, 2020, through January 3, 2022).
Going back to 1933, markets have averaged double-digit returns in all years that a single party controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress. This is just below the average gains in years with a split Congress, a scenario which many believe is a strong possibility this year. Even the “least good” outcome — when the president’s opposing party controls Congress — notched a solid 7.4% average price return.
What’s the bottom line for investors?
Midterm elections — and politics as a whole — generate a lot of noise and uncertainty.
Even if elections spur higher volatility there is no need to fear them. The reality is that long-term equity returns come from the value of individual companies over time. Smart investors would be wise to look past the short-term highs and lows and maintain a long-term focus.

210,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/is-us-already-in-recession.html,Is the U.S. already in a recession?,United States,"August 4, 2022","Is the U.S. economy in recession or not? That’s the question on the minds of many investors as U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) declined for two consecutive quarters in the first half of the year, a commonly cited definition of recession.
However, with consistently strong job growth, historically low unemployment and solid growth in consumer spending, that doesn’t sound like a recession most people would remember. So what’s the conclusion?
“It depends on who you ask,” says Capital Group economist Jared Franz. “With food, energy and shelter prices all rising faster than wages, the average American consumer would probably say yes. In my view, we are either on the edge of a recession or we are already tipping into it.”
To put things in perspective, over the past 70 years the average U.S. recession has lasted about 10 months and resulted in a GDP decline of 2.5%. In Franz’s estimation, the next one may be worse than average, if current trends persist, but still less severe than the Great Recession from December 2007 to June 2009.
Key economic indicators point to a potential recession
Sources: Capital Group, Bureau of Economic Analysis, National Bureau of Economic Research, U.S. Department of Commerce. Y-axis is limited to a range of –10% to +10% to represent a normalized range, but Q2:20 and Q3:20 exceed this range (at –35.7% and +30.2%) largely due to the pandemic. As of June 30, 2022.
When will we know for sure?
The official arbiter of U.S. recessions, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), takes a while to share its view. The nonprofit group considers many factors beyond GDP, including employment levels, household income and industrial production. Since NBER usually doesn’t reveal its findings until six to nine months after a recession has started, we may not get an official announcement until next year.
“It’s fair to say that most consumers probably don’t care what NBER thinks,” Franz adds. “They see inflation above 9%, sharply higher energy prices and declining home sales. They feel the impact of those data points. The labor market is one of the only data points that isn’t signaling a recession right now.”

The U.S. added 372,000 jobs in June, higher than most economists expected. The unemployment rate remained steady at 3.6%, close to a record low. However, as Franz explains, that number reflects a supply-demand mismatch in an economy that hasn’t fully recovered from the pandemic. In the months ahead, he expects greater numbers of jobseekers to return. That should increase the unemployment rate as companies reduce hiring.
One bright spot: A strong U.S. job market
Sources: Capital Group, Bureau of Labor Statistics, National Bureau of Economic Research, U.S. Department of Labor. As of June 2022.
Consumer spending, meanwhile, rose 1.1% in June. That’s a strong number on the surface, Franz says, but after adjusting for inflation, it’s essentially flat. It also reflects higher spending on necessities such as health care and housing while masking declines in discretionary categories such as clothing and recreation. That spending shift was underscored recently when Walmart and Best Buy issued profit warnings, noting that higher prices for food and energy were hurting sales of discretionary items.
“We haven’t seen overall consumer spending or employment levels decline yet,” Franz says, “but I think it’s just a matter of time.”
Housing comes under pressure
Another troubling sign is the rapid decline in new home sales. With the U.S. Federal Reserve aggressively raising interest rates to fight inflation, mortgage rates have soared in recent months, triggering a sharp reaction in the housing market.
New single-family home purchases fell last month by 8.1%, the biggest drop in more than two years. Sales of previously owned homes tumbled 5.4%, the fifth consecutive month of declines. Additionally, a dramatic rise in home prices during the pandemic raises concerns about the potential for a painful correction.
Rising home inventories suggest this recession could be more difficult
Sources: Capital Group, National Bureau of Economic Research, U.S. Census Bureau. As of June 2022.
“When it comes to the impact on the economy, the housing market punches far above its weight,” Franz explains. “I'm mulling the risk that a larger correction in this sector could increase the depth and duration of the next recession.”
Why inflation should subside
If we are heading into a recessionary period, the silver lining could be a reversal of the extreme inflation pressures witnessed over the past year. In fact, some argue that inflation has spiraled so far out of control it could take a substantial recession to bring it down to the Fed’s 2% target. In June, U.S. inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1%.
“The pivotal question is: Are we in a new inflationary regime or not? I don’t think we are,” says Pramod Atluri, principal investment officer of The Bond Fund of America®.  “Consumer prices are likely coming down over the next few months as the recession kicks in and demand wanes.”
What does that mean for the bond market — which, so far this year, has experienced the biggest decline in four decades? It means much of the pain may be over, Atluri says, as the Fed considers whether it can continue raising interest rates in the face of an economic downturn. In fact, the bond market is already pricing in expectations that the Fed will cut rates multiple times in 2023.
“There are a lot of signs that inflation has peaked,” Atluri adds, citing falling prices for gasoline since mid-June, as well as wheat, corn and other commodities since mid-May. “That may give the Fed the cover it needs to support economic growth while still taking inflation seriously.”
In the meantime, Atluri expects more volatility as the market adjusts to tighter monetary policy. In his portfolios, that means shifting toward higher quality investments, including U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities while also looking for opportunistic investments in corporate and emerging markets bonds where investors are being compensated for the rising recession risk.
Consider all-weather investing
Similarly in the equity markets, identifying high-quality companies with steady cash flows and reliable profit margins is key to surviving recessions, says Diana Wagner, a portfolio manager with Washington Mutual Investors FundSM. Companies with solid and growing dividends are particularly attractive.
“In this environment, you want to invest in companies whose fundamentals will hold up relatively better. Pricing power and steady demand are big components of that,” Wagner said during a recent Capital Group webinar.
“I prefer a relatively concentrated, all-weather portfolio that can thrive in a variety of market environments,” she adds. “My top holdings are health care, software and insurance companies. I also like consumer staples, but you have to be very selective in that sector because some valuations have become quite high.”
Recessions have been painful but less impactful than expansions
Sources: Capital Group, National Bureau of Economic Research, Refinitiv Datastream. Chart data is latest available as of 6/30/22 and shown on a logarithmic scale. The expansion that began in 2020 is still considered current as of 6/30/22 and not included in the average expansion summary statistics. Since NBER announces recession start and end months, rather than exact dates, we have used month-end dates as a proxy for calculations of jobs added. Nearest quarter-end values used for GDP growth rates.
What type of recession is Wagner preparing for?
“There are a lot of mixed signals, but clearly the economy is slowing and I think the risk of stagflation is real,” she says, referring to a period of stagnant growth and high inflation in the 1970s. “Every recession is miserable in its own way, but I expect the next one to be less damaging than in 2008. The important thing for investors to remember is that recessions usually have been short-lived and expansions have been far more powerful.”

211,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/pandemic-war-and-climate-change-sharpen-focus-on-esg.html,"Pandemic, war and climate change sharpen focus on ESG",ESG,"July 27, 2022","While COVID-19 helped accelerate the ESG agenda, the tragic invasion of Ukraine is likely to further speed up its evolution.
The pandemic shone a spotlight on the “S” — or social issues — of ESG. The conflict in Ukraine has brought the “G” (the governance component) to investors’ attention. At the same time, a growing understanding of the implications and importance of climate change has meant that “E” (the environmental piece) continues to dominate investors’ ESG focus.
These insights and many more surfaced in Capital Group’s annual ESG global study published in May 2022. Collecting views from more than 1,100 institutional and wholesale investment professionals across Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific, the study showed ESG trends continue to gain traction.
ESG momentum builds
Momentum behind ESG and sustainability continues to build, fueled by investor demand and a desire to make an impact. Compared with the previous year, a higher proportion of global investors describe their ESG stance as one of conviction, acceptance or compliance. This global cohort of ESG adopters rose to almost 90%, up from 84% in 2021. Over the same period, the number who are either on the sidelines or non-adopters has fallen to 11%, down from 16% the previous year.
ESG adoption by global investors continues to grow
Source: Capital Group, ESG Global Study 2022.
Conviction in ESG is further underscored in the finding that just 13% of global investors agree ESG is a passing fad and will go out of fashion. This demonstrates how most investors view ESG as a permanent and pre-eminent part of the investment landscape.

The “E” of ESG continues to dominate, but greater recognition of “S”
The structural and societal pressures arising from climate change have been key in driving environmental issues — the “E” in ESG — to the top of investors’ sustainability concerns. The study showed that the environment continued to dominate allocation decisions, with investors increasing their focus on “E,” which rose from the year before (47% vs. 44%).
The “E” in ESG still dominates
Source: Capital Group, ESG Global Study 2022.
Although investors indicated an even greater focus on environmental issues in 2022, there are signs that this may change in the future as people recognize an imbalance. When asked whether social issues are being overlooked by this environmental focus, 41% of investors agreed.
Qualitative research we carried out as part of the study suggests some reasons behind these views. It is possible that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic raised greater awareness on the importance of safe working conditions, access to health care and education.
The “S” in ESG is rising in prominence
Source: Capital Group, ESG Global Study 2022.
As strict lockdowns were imposed across the world, companies operating in the retail and health care sectors came under particular pressure to ensure the safety and well-being of their workers. Many responded by providing protective equipment or extending paid sick leave to temporary staff and contractors. Other companies provided their goods and services free of charge — such as internet access, video conferences and remote learning to schools and universities — as a way of supporting their broader communities.
With an increased understanding that social issues can have material and far-reaching consequences for companies and the communities they serve, the impact of the pandemic may have prompted investors to look across a wider range of ESG issues.
“G” increases its profile
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also brought several ESG issues into the spotlight, with concerns around governance flagged by respondents in the survey.
The global response to Russian aggression was not just political, as the corporate sector was quick to take a stance. Many companies made statements regarding their business exposure to Russia.
At Capital Group, we followed company actions closely. While much of the media focus was on actions announced publicly, we paid particular attention to companies that had not made public statements. Digging behind the public pronouncements helped us to gain a better understanding of the impacts and how companies’ license to operate may be affected.
Sentiments on governance concerns were echoed by a number of investors surveyed.
“I think the crisis should, and probably will, bring governance into sharper focus,” says the CIO of an independent advisory firm. “But that should have always been the case — it’s sad that we need a tragedy and war to highlight the importance of the ‘G’.”
A portfolio manager at a wealth management firm agreed: “I think the crisis has strengthened the ESG argument because it really is making people focus on what’s important — and that’s social governance, which is right up there in my view.”
The impacts of major world events have always been felt in investment markets. Building an understanding of the first-, second- and third-order effects of events and how these might impact investment decisions is not new. Viewing the consequences of these events through an ESG lens can provide a richer perspective and help frame events for investors.
However, there are still challenges to overcome, which the survey also highlighted.
Access to reliable and consistent ESG data remains a key challenge
A theme that came through loud and clear in last year’s study, and was reinforced in this year’s results, is the difficulties experienced in accessing and interpreting ESG data. Specific issues raised by respondents included access to ESG data, consistency between ESG data providers and transparency of benchmark and index data.
Difficulties with the robustness of data and inconsistent scores are hampering the ability of investors to incorporate ESG considerations into their investment process.
ESG ratings and accessing data remain the largest challenges
Source: Capital Group, ESG Global Study 2022.
The No. 1 challenge global investors cited in implementing ESG investments is a lack of consistency between different ESG rating providers (25%). This was closely followed by difficulties accessing ESG information and data.
Inconsistent and inaccurate ESG scores result from a multitude of factors. These include backward-looking data that fails to adequately assess the future value of companies transitioning to address sustainability issues. These companies could play an important role in driving change and may become tomorrow’s ESG leaders. The subjective nature of scoring systems also means there are varying views on the relative importance and material impact of different ESG factors in different sectors and countries.
Consistency in regulation was also raised as a significant roadblock. Investors are looking to regulators to provide common standards and definitions. When asked what the ESG regulatory framework should prioritize in their respective countries, the highest proportion of respondents cite the need to harmonize global standards, taxonomies and metrics (45%). This indicates investors are struggling to untangle an increasingly complex and disjointed web of global regulations issued by different entities.
Overcoming data challenges will help ESG to broaden its reach. Results from our global study show that momentum behind ESG and sustainability continues to build. Despite challenges around data, it appears that investors’ awareness of ESG topics is not just increasing, it is also broadening to cover a wider range of social and governance issues.

Market Volatility"
212,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/rob-lovelace-all-weather-investing.html,Rob Lovelace on all-weather investing,Markets & Economy,"June 29, 2022","The world has changed.
We are living through a pivotal time in history, marked by geopolitical realignment, high inflation, volatile financial markets and the end of a 40-year period of declining interest rates. The title of this new era could be Brave New World or Back to the Future. But I think the title I would select is Revenge of the Boomers, because a lot of these events rhyme with the past, particularly the early 1960s. That’s when we saw interest rates bottom out after decades of decline, as well as the rise of the Cold War era, which is unfortunately rearing its head again in some respects.
Despite these challenges, I remain optimistic about the investing environment for several reasons. First, there are still signs of growth as the global economy recovers from the pandemic. Second, I believe corporate earnings will be the driving force of equity markets going forward, as opposed to multiple expansion, and that signifies a welcome return to fundamentals. Multiples needed to contract, and that is what we’ve seen over the past few months.
Third, I think we will experience a healthy recession in the next year or two. That’s right, a healthy recession. Despite all the worry about it, I see a moderate recession as necessary to clean out the excesses of the past decade. You can’t have such a sustained period of growth without an occasional downturn to balance things out. It’s normal. It’s expected. It’s healthy.
We’ve seen a strong market leadership change in recent months
Sources: Capital Group, FactSet, MSCI, Standard & Poor’s. MT FAANG represents the collective price performance of shares of Microsoft, Tesla, Meta (Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet (Google). Defensive stocks typically generate relatively stable returns regardless of the state of the economy or the overall markets. Cyclical stocks tend to move up or down roughly in line with economic growth or contraction cycles. Index values do not reflect the impact of dividends. Data shown as of 4/30/22.
What this means for stock markets
In my view, we are heading into a period of real change, a fundamentally different marketplace where different leadership will emerge. That’s in sharp contrast to the 2020 COVID-19 downturn, which was really just a temporary blip in a decade-plus bull market. We know this because the same stocks that led the bull market — a relatively small group of tech-related companies — did so on the way back up.
In a true market shift, the leadership coming out of a bear market is usually a new sector or a new group of companies. And it’s not necessarily the same group that led on the way down. For instance, in the current environment, energy stocks have staged a remarkable rally. Do I think the energy sector is going to drive the next bull market? I do not.
Market leaders before and after a bear market are rarely the same
Sources: Capital Group, MSCI, Refinitiv Datastream. Returns are absolute total returns in U.S. dollars. The periods covered are: the tech bubble, December 31, 1996 to May 31, 2000 (before bear market) and September 30, 2002 to December 30, 2005 (after bear market); the global financial crisis, December 31, 2003 to September 28, 2007 (before) and May 31, 2009 to December 31, 2013 (after); and the current market, December 31, 2021 to May 31, 2022.
That said, I wouldn’t count out the FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) stocks, but I think it’s going to be a very different market going forward. It won’t be driven by a small set of stocks anymore. It won’t be characterized by growth vs. value, or U.S. vs. international. Those binary concepts don’t make sense in this environment. I think the market will be less one dimensional, and I expect a broader mix of stocks to lead us out of this downturn.
What this means for bond markets
We are also seeing a profound shift in bond markets as we reach the end of a 40-year path of falling interest rates. Sharply higher inflation levels, not seen since the 1980s, are forcing the Federal Reserve and other central banks to aggressively tighten monetary policy. The Fed is behind the curve, which means rates are probably going to move higher from here.
However, that doesn't mean we are going back to exceedingly high inflation and interest rates. It just means that, for decades, we have lived in a declining rate environment that has been highly supportive of markets. That’s all changed. Things are likely to be more difficult going forward. But even amid these headwinds, opportunities will emerge.
Is this the end of a 40-year declining rate period?
Sources: Capital Group, Refinitiv Datastream. Data shown as of 6/23/2022.
That’s one reason I like to call this era “Revenge of the Boomers,” because it’s so reminiscent of the 1960s. Interest rates moved higher, but they didn’t spike to 16% overnight. It took decades for that to happen, and there were many policy mistakes along the way. Throughout the 1960s, rates stayed in the 3% to 6% range. It was a volatile period, but overall it was still a good environment for investing. The real trouble came later. Hopefully we’ve learned some lessons from the past and we won’t repeat the 1970s.
In the meantime, it’s important to remember that higher nominal interest rates are good for savers. This is a novel concept for younger folks, but boomers grew up in a world where interest rates were sufficient to earn a decent return on savings accounts and money market funds. That’s a positive change. It makes people feel better about saving, and I see it as a solid underpinning for the market.
Over time, higher rates will also bring income back to the fixed income markets — something that has been sorely missed in the era of easy money. The importance of that shift cannot be overstated. It should eventually restore bonds to their rightful role providing diversification from equity risk.
Along those same lines, some inflation is actually a good thing. It allows well-positioned companies to raise prices, and it results in generally higher wages. That makes people feel better about their jobs and progress. It is hard to predict what will happen to real purchasing power, but we have seen in the past decade that without a little inflation, people feel like they’re not getting ahead.
What this means for investors
Maintaining a balanced, “all-weather” portfolio makes sense in any environment, but particularly this one. Earlier this year I reminded investors to keep an eye on valuations and prepare for a market correction. I remarked that I was buying a raincoat, but not putting it on yet. Turns out, it’s nice to have that raincoat handy. Market volatility has returned, but that’s no reason to be discouraged.
At Capital Group, our fundamental, bottom-up investment approach leaves us well positioned to identify specific companies that can generate strong earnings growth. We remain confident that we have the right people in place making decisions based on deep, company-specific research, which has always formed the basis of our long-term investment philosophy.
Indeed, the world has changed dramatically. But, for selective investors, change creates opportunity.

215,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/end-era-easy-money.html,Is the era of easy money coming to an end?,Interest Rates,"April 20, 2022","With interest rates trending downward for more than 40 years, investors enjoyed a powerful tailwind driving one of the greatest bull markets in history. But what happens when rates suddenly start moving up as inflation soars to levels not seen since the 1980s? We’re about to find out.
Now that the U.S. Federal Reserve and many other central banks around the world have committed to hiking rates and cutting stimulus measures, investors face an important question: Is the era of easy money coming to an end? As usual in the financial markets, the answer isn’t a simple yes or no.
“It's probably the end of free money, but I don't think it's the end of easy money,” says David Hoag, a keen Fed watcher and portfolio manager with The Bond Fund of America®. “Central banks will do what they need to do to get inflation under control, but I don’t think they will be able to go too far before the real economy starts hurting.”
Free fall: Interest rates have plummeted in the era of easy money
Sources: Federal Reserve, Refinitiv Datastream. As of 4/11/22.
The Fed, for instance, isn’t likely to raise the federal funds target rate anywhere near the long-term historical average of just under 5.0%, Hoag notes. The Fed’s key policy rate — which guides overnight lending among U.S. banks and influences many other forms of borrowing — currently sits in a range between 0.25% and 0.50% following last month’s rate hike.

Hoag thinks the Fed will stop hiking somewhere around 2.0%. “That’s a significant increase from where we are today,” he acknowledges, “but it’s still very low on a historical basis. Anything higher than that, in my view, risks pushing the U.S. into a recession.”
At the moment, market expectations are higher, thanks to hawkish comments from Fed officials over the past few weeks. The futures market is pricing in a rate of 3.0% by March 2023, including a 50 basis point hike at the Fed’s next two-day meeting beginning May 3.
Fed rate hike expectations have risen dramatically
Sources: Capital Group, Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Federal funds target path based on probability analysis of fed fund futures contract prices as calculated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. As of April 14, 2022.
Over the past 14 years, the Fed has taken the previously unprecedented step of slashing its key policy rate to near zero — first as a reaction to the 2007–2009 global financial crisis and then to help support the U.S. economy during the COVID-19 crisis. Massive bond-buying stimulus programs also served to keep longer term interest rates artificially low.
“You can’t keep money at zero interest rates forever,” says Capital Group economist Darrell Spence. “We are seeing the end of this current period of zero rates and balance sheet expansion, but I’m not convinced that we won’t be back here again.”
Pushing the “easy button”
The Fed, European Central Bank and other central banks have found the “easy button” when it comes to addressing periods of severe financial crisis, Spence explains, and it would be naïve to think they won’t use it when the next crisis comes along.
“I’m sure history will look back at this period and find many reasons to argue that it was a bad idea,” he adds. “But, in the moment, it’s difficult to say what else we could have done or what we might do differently in the future. When you let the genie out of the bottle on this type of monetary policy, it’s hard to put it back in.”
In the meantime, investors should brace for further volatility as high inflation, tighter monetary policy and the war in Ukraine continue to disrupt markets. Recession risk is higher in Europe, Spence says, because of its closer proximity to the war and dependence on Russian energy, but the U.S. economy is also slowing under the weight of broken supply chains and higher consumer prices.
Spence doesn’t think a U.S. recession is imminent, but he puts the chance of an economic downturn at 25% to 30% by 2023, particularly if the Fed follows through with a full complement of rate hikes between now and then.
What does an environment of low growth and rising rates mean for investing?
Consider building an “all weather” portfolio
Despite investor fears of tighter monetary policy, U.S. stocks and bonds have powered through previous periods of rising interest rates. During 10 such periods since 1964, the S&P 500 has posted an average return of 7.7%. Bonds have also held up well, with the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index returning an average of 3.9% during seven rate hiking cycles dating back to 1983.
The initial adjustment period can be tough, as we saw in the first quarter of this year, with the S&P 500 down 4.6%. Bonds suffered their worst quarter in 20 years, with a 5.9% decline. But over longer time periods, markets have tended to adjust, and bond investors in particular have benefited from the opportunity to reinvest at higher yields.
U.S. stocks generally have done well during past rising rate periods
Sources: Capital Group, Refinitiv Datastream, Standard & Poor's, U.S. Federal Reserve. S&P 500 returns represent annualized total returns.
Of course, this data comes with the usual caveat that past results are not predictive of future returns. And, in fact, we’ve never experienced a period where central banks are unwinding massive balance sheets — much larger than they were following the global financial crisis — while raising interest rates from zero (or even negative territory in the case of the ECB). A lot can go wrong.
Such uncertainty makes building an “all weather” portfolio all the more important, says Diana Wagner, a portfolio manager with Washington Mutual Investors FundSM.
For active investors, the key to navigating difficult periods is finding attractively valued companies that can generate earnings and profit growth regardless of the economic environment, Wagner explains.
“In this environment, there's going to be less tolerance for business models that can’t demonstrate a path to profitability in some reasonable time frame,” she says. That’s in contrast to last year when unprofitable tech companies rallied.
That doesn’t mean tech stocks can’t do well. In fact, the information technology sector has generated solid returns during the last four periods of rising rates. But it’s important to be selective.
Which sectors have performed best when interest rates rise?
Sources: Capital Group, Refinitiv Datastream, S&P 500. Rate hike reference periods include February 1994–February 1995, June 1999–May 2000, June 2004–June 2006, and December 2015–December 2018. Average return calculations are based on annualized total returns.
Wagner cites Microsoft, UnitedHealth and Marsh & McLennan as examples that have exhibited “all weather” capabilities in the past.
“In a market where growth may be scarce,” she adds, “I prefer companies that have a demonstrated track record of making their own growth happen — companies with high return on equity, low commodity input costs and strong pricing power.”
Moreover, valuations are paramount.
“I think the era of not paying attention to valuations is gone,” Wagner says.

216,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/10-investment-themes-2022.html,10 investment themes for 2022,Global Equities,"March 31, 2022","Investors are facing new risks and a market in transition. From the conflict in Ukraine to high inflation and rising interest rates, the future seems as uncertain as ever. And as central banks reduce stimulus, we are likely to see a shift in market leadership, along with sustained volatility.
In these uncertain times, we believe it’s important to step back and consider the long-term trends that are driving companies and markets. That’s why we asked our investment team to highlight 10 themes they are closely following today.
Some of these are within industries under pressure or facing near-term headwinds. But we invest in companies, not industries. It’s our job to analyze individual businesses, meet with management and invest in a select group of companies we believe are most likely to prosper in the years ahead.
Here are 10 investment themes for 2022:
1. Pricing power
2. Tech trifecta
3. Dividend comeback
4. Health care innovation
5. Transportation transformation
6. China challenges and opportunities
7. Media disruption
8. Future of financials
9. ESG everywhere
10. Flexible fixed income
1. Pricing power
Diana Wagner, equity portfolio manager, Washington Mutual Investors FundSM
I believe inflation will linger in the months ahead, making it one of the biggest risks investors face in 2022. That’s why I am focused on uncovering companies with pricing power that can protect their profit margins by passing those costs along to customers.
Companies with pricing power potential include consumer businesses with strong brand recognition, like beverage makers Keurig Dr Pepper and Coca-Cola; companies in the fast-growing video games segment, like Microsoft and Tencent; and companies providing essential services, like Pfizer and UnitedHealth.
Semiconductor companies with proprietary chip designs, like Broadcom, or Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML, could also raise their prices in an inflationary environment.
Some industries have a greater potential for pricing power
Sources: Capital Group, FactSet, MSCI. Reflects select industries within the MSCI World Index. Average and standard deviation of gross margins are calculated for the five-year period ending 12/31/21. Average gross margin is net sales less the cost of goods sold and is shown as a percentage of net sales. Standard deviation is a common measure of variation that tells how a statistic has varied from the mean over time. A lower number signifies lower volatility.
With slowing growth, rising inflation and conflicts overseas, 2022 is off to a rough start. But I’m optimistic that an active portfolio of select companies with strong pricing power may help investors thrive in the year ahead.

2. Tech trifecta
Mark Casey, equity portfolio manager, The Growth Fund of America®
Semiconductors, cloud computing and software — what I call the tech trifecta — are three industries I’m following closely this year.
If pricing power is a key to fighting inflation, then the semiconductor industry is in a strong position. Supply chain disruptions have chip prices skyrocketing, pressuring manufacturers that increasingly depend on them. Anyone who tried to find a PlayStation 5 last Christmas knows what I mean.
Even in the wake of supply chain issues, I see no end to the world’s appetite for semiconductors. Today a new car uses as many as 3,000 chips, and that number is growing with each new model.
Semiconductors are the backbone cloud technology companies use to power their business. I believe we are still in the early innings of the cloud transition. For example, makers of CPUs, like Advanced Micro Devices; DRAM chipmaker Samsung; and ST Microelectronics, which develops microcontrollers, could all see demand multiply for years.
Demand for semiconductors is soaring, along with prices
Sources: Capital Group, Applied Materials. All figures are in USD. As of June 16, 2021.
If chips are the backbone of the cloud, then software is the brains. Today, software is driving advancements not only in e-commerce and finance but also health care, education, transportation, construction and agriculture. It’s been a tough year in the market for many software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies. But my job is to look past today’s volatility to understand fundamental growth dynamics that can drive long-term returns.

3. Dividend comeback
Caroline Randall, equity portfolio manager, Capital Income Builder®
Companies are shifting from dividend zeros to dividend heroes.
Particularly in Europe, companies suspended dividends during the pandemic primarily due to political or regulatory pressure, but now many of them have surplus capital to redeploy as regular and catch-up dividends.
You might think the search for dividend income starts with companies that pay the highest yields. While these companies can be sound investments, a high dividend yield can also be a warning sign and potentially unsustainable.
Our research shows that since 2007, the highest yielding quintile of stocks had the lowest overall returns. We found the sweet spot to be the next bucket of dividend payers, those that yielded closer to 3%. This group included companies with more stable balance sheets and attractive dividend growth prospects.
Businesses across sectors and borders are raising their dividends
Sources: Capital Group, Refinitiv Datastream. Represents examples of companies that have raised their dividends during the two-year period from 12/31/19–12/31/21.
This year, I’m focused on companies with strong underlying earnings growth that have demonstrated a commitment to raising their dividends over time. Increasing dividend payouts can be a signal of management’s confidence in future earnings growth. Dividend growers historically have tended to generate greater returns than other dividend strategies, while also keeping up with the broader market. Dividend growth can also offer a measure of resilience against inflation and interest rate hikes.

4. Health care innovation
Rich Wolf, equity portfolio manager, The New Economy Fund®
Life-changing drugs are being developed and approved faster than ever. The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna provide a powerful affirmation of the global nature of innovation.
Will that breakneck speed continue in 2022? With recent advancements in genomic and proteomic analysis and the launch of many new modalities of drugs, I believe it will. Today we have new therapies designed to engineer how the body recognizes and treats disease itself that have the potential to extend lives and generate billions of dollars in revenue for companies able to develop them successfully.
New drugs are coming to market faster than ever
Source: Food and Drug Administration. As of 12/31/21.
But it’s not just drug discovery that excites me. A massive wave of innovation from health technology companies has led to improved diagnostics — both in the lab and at home. For example, Dexcom’s continuous glucose monitor allows diabetics to continuously check their glucose levels and integrate that information directly to an insulin pump.
Companies like Exact Sciences and Illumina have developed liquid biopsy blood tests and genomic technologies that enable early detection of cancer and help in the research of complex diseases. In addition, as the technology improves, remote patient monitoring and home diagnostics are becoming part of the continuum of care.

5. Transportation transformation
Kaitlyn Murphy, equity investment analyst covering automobile & components manufacturers
Ladies and gentlemen, start your batteries.
The adoption curve of electric vehicles (EVs) has steepened thanks in large part to government incentives and tighter emissions standards for gas-burning cars, particularly in China and Europe. The price of batteries, which can account for a third of a vehicle’s cost, has also plunged. EV makers are now appealing to more consumers by introducing models with lower prices, better performance and longer range.
Tesla has raced ahead of global competition in EV sales
Sources: CleanTechnica, EV-Volumes.com, Statista. Estimates as of January 2022. SAIC-GM-Wuling is a joint venture based in China.
Although EVs are on the threshold of profitability, some will likely get there sooner than others. Tesla has been a clear leader, having briefly surpassed a market cap of $1 trillion in 2021. Companies quick to embrace structural change and rapidly adapt have a better chance of success over the long term, whether they are industry titans or startups. Innovative manufacturers can also differentiate themselves with their use of software, which allows for vehicles that can learn and improve, become safer and introduce more services over time.
Many believe the level of disruption in transportation will make it difficult for incumbents to survive, but don’t count them out. At General Motors, CEO Mary Bara is disrupting the company from within. In addition to its pledge to go all-electric by 2035, the company has invested heavily in Cruise, its self-driving unit. I believe it could be one of the future leaders.

6. China challenges and opportunities
Winnie Kwan, equity portfolio manager, New World Fund®
Risks to investing in China have risen due to macro and regulatory issues. Investors need to tread carefully with sectors such as property, education and gaming. However, I believe there are still compelling long-term, secular growth trends that make the country an attractive market on a stock-by-stock basis.
For example, China is positioned to dominate the global manufacturing supply chain for EVs and decarbonization solutions such as solar. Chinese manufacturers are producing high value-add parts at scale, including servo motors, electric drive trains and thermo management systems. A fast-growing home market for EVs is supportive of the supply chain development. China is already a dominating force in solar panel manufacturing, and it is increasingly leading in specific components such as inverters.
Automation is another growth area, driven by manufacturing upgrades and an aging population. Japanese and European companies have historically dominated production of precision parts and components in automation, but Chinese manufacturers are rapidly taking share.
Localization and import substitution continue to be big trends, not only in capital goods but in health care and medical technology equipment. At the same time, contract development and manufacturing organizations have become a sweet spot. These companies are partnering with multinationals on drug development, testing and manufacturing, often at lower prices and higher efficiency.

7. Media disruption
Martin Romo, equity portfolio manager, The Investment Company of America®
This January, three blockbuster deals announced over a matter of days highlighted the swift change of pace in the industry.
If all three are finalized — Microsoft’s bid for gaming giant Activision Blizzard among them — it would amount to more than $90 billion in M&A activity centered on video games, the fastest-growing segment of the media sector.
Driven in part by a pandemic-era gaming boom, the media landscape is fundamentally transforming the way people communicate and entertain themselves. That makes interactive games all the more valuable to the likes of Microsoft, Sony and many others.
It’s a testament to how powerful and alluring video games have become. The $200 billion gaming industry provides compelling entertainment at a reasonable cost, and it’s already surpassed the movie industry in terms of annual gross revenue. Fundamentally, I think that growth is likely to continue and even accelerate in the years ahead.
The disruption also extends to other segments of the media and entertainment world. Netflix, the clear leader in streaming video with over 200 million subscribers, is encountering fierce competition from Amazon and Apple, as well as old guard companies like Disney. The biggest threat to Netflix’s dominance may be Disney+, whose deep library of intellectual property-driven content has helped it attract 130 million subscribers in just three years.

8. Future of financials
Emme Kozloff, equity investment analyst covering global capital market infrastructure providers and U.S. and European discount brokers
Today the financials sector encompasses a broader set of opportunities than traditional banks and insurers. Among these are exchanges, data providers and asset managers. Financial exchanges that focus on equity trading may even benefit from increased volume during volatile markets.
Financial exchanges have outpaced the broader market
Sources: MSCI, RIMES. Returns rebased to 100 on 12/31/05. As of 12/31/21.
I believe several trends will drive growth in financial exchanges. One is the modernization of fixed income trading, which is moving out of the horse-and-buggy era. As fixed income — by far the largest asset class in the world with over $100 trillion in assets — moves to digital trading, exchanges like Tradeweb could see their sales volumes soar.
Another driver of growth is the voracious appetite for data analytics. London Stock Exchange, known primarily for its equity exchanges, and Standard & Poor’s, known largely as a ratings agency and index creator, have built robust analytics offerings. Likewise, only a third of NASDAQ’s revenue comes from trading with much of the rest coming from its data services segment. I don’t think the market fully appreciates just how diversified many of these companies are.
To invest successfully in financials, it can help to look really closely at each of these companies to understand what assets they own and where those offerings fit into the business cycle.

9. ESG everywhere
Rob Lovelace, vice chair and president of Capital Group and equity portfolio manager, New Perspective Fund®
Environmental, social and governance investing, or ESG, is everywhere, and it's only going to get more important.
At Capital Group, we have integrated ESG principles into our investment decision-making. We don’t think of ESG as just an exclusion process. We think of it as identifying companies that are doing the right thing and supporting those in transition, such as oil companies shifting toward clean energy.
This effort extends far beyond the energy sector. For example, buildings pump more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than the entire transport industry. One of the most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to improve air conditioning and heating efficiency. Regulations that require the replacement of older systems with more energy-efficient products in Europe and elsewhere could underpin a long-term tailwind for HVAC companies like Daikin and Carrier.
I understand there is some trepidation about how our industry will implement ESG concepts. People are worried about new government regulations, additional rules or expanded disclosure requirements. But I would say: This is important. While there’s a lot to learn, I believe we should approach it with a sense of optimism and enthusiasm.

10. Flexible fixed income
Damien McCann, fixed income portfolio manager, American Funds Multi-Sector Income FundSM
Inflation is running hot — and that’s cooling bond returns. Speculation about the Federal Reserve’s path and pace of interest rate hikes has pressured bond prices.
The good news? High inflation is partially a response to extraordinary consumer demand. The economy is doing well. People have jobs and cash — and they want to spend it. What’s more, many companies have strong balance sheets and are positioned for growth.
In my mind, this means there are solid investment opportunities in corporate bonds. The post-pandemic economy may benefit casinos and cruise lines as demand returns. Energy prices have jumped, which could help both midstream and exploration and production companies. On the other hand, I think that rising labor costs and shortages could crimp growth for consumer-oriented retail companies. Restaurants may also feel the pinch.
The relative value between higher income bond sectors such as investment grade (rated BBB/Baa and above), high yield, emerging markets and securitized debt is always changing. I’m focused on identifying which of these offer the most attractive investment opportunities for income-seeking investors. Recently, the underlying strength in the economy and the shorter interest duration in high yield and securitized debt have made those sectors more attractive.
I take a flexible, diversified approach to allocating among these different sectors based on market conditions and investment insights. This could help create a more resilient income and return stream for investors.

Today’s challenging environment is causing more market volatility than we’ve seen since the onset of the pandemic. Against a backdrop of slowing growth and high inflation, the tragic war in Ukraine adds a new series of risks and unknowns.
However, history has shown that markets have powered through past periods of geopolitical market shocks. It’s important to remember that investors can still find opportunity in the midst of chaos — be it war, inflation, or recession. There are still many companies that are thriving and innovating, so that’s where we focus most of our time and energy.

Market Volatility
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. Small-company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness.

217,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/is-spike-commodity-prices-sustainable.html,Is the spike in commodity prices sustainable?,Inflation,"March 24, 2022","For a glimpse of just how volatile commodities currently are, look at nickel markets. Prices doubled in early March. Then they fell sharply. Then the London Metals Exchange halted trading. This week, the market for nickel — a key component in electric vehicle batteries and stainless steel products — reopened but with strict trading limits.
It’s just one example of how the global economy is being disrupted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia provides about 20% of the world’s nickel supply. The threat of losing it roiled trading markets and sent buyers scrambling for other sources.
Commodity prices skyrocket amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict
Sources: Capital Group, London Metal Exchange, Refinitiv Datastream, U.S. Department of Agriculture. As of March 16, 2022.
Commodity prices have climbed sharply since the February 24 invasion, especially for materials produced in Russia and Ukraine. That includes wheat, oil and natural gas, as well as other key metals such as aluminum, palladium and copper.
But prices were rising long before the start of the conflict, contributing to inflationary pressures not seen since the early 1980s. So, the crucial question for investors is: Are these price spikes sustainable?
“In the short term, the answer is no,” says Lisa Thompson, a portfolio manager with New World Fund®, “The market has overreacted, and we’re already seeing prices come back down a bit. But, compared to where we were a year ago, commodity prices are significantly higher — and I do think that’s a durable trend.”
“Over the long term,” Thompson adds, “prices are likely to remain elevated due to a number of factors, including rising demand, supply shortages and deglobalization forces symbolized by the war in Ukraine and strained U.S.-China relations. Higher prices should be expected in a world where free and open trade is in retreat.”
Metals industry poised to shine
From an investment perspective, this has clear implications for the metals & mining sector. It has been a neglected area of the market for more than a decade — even longer if you exclude the last major price spike during the 2008 global financial crisis.
The sector has been undervalued for years and remains so today despite a recent rally in mining company stocks, says Douglas Upton, a Capital Group equity analyst who has covered commodity markets for more than 30 years. Upton thinks many commodity prices will remain high for years due to chronic underinvestment by the industry since 2015. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that it takes more time than it did in the past to launch new mining projects.
“It’s a multiyear process,” Upton explains. “Discovery, permitting and funding all take much longer. In price terms, that points to higher highs and higher lows until new investments start to produce results.” This dynamic doesn’t apply to food and other crops, Upton notes, because production in those areas can be ramped up much faster.
Historically speaking, commodities are cheap relative to U.S. stocks

“All of the big mining companies are undervalued in my view,” he says. “The market is not thinking enough about the consequences of the underinvestment theme. Valuations, and consensus earnings estimates, assume that commodity prices will decline over the next few years, closer to historical averages. I think that is quite wrong.”
Case in point: Look at the market capitalization of the world’s seven largest mining companies. Even combined, they do not come close to the market value of a beloved new-economy company such as Tesla. The automaker needs certain refined metals, including nickel, to produce its lithium-ion batters. So much so that Tesla CEO Elon Musk cited access to nickel as one of his biggest production concerns long before Russia invaded Ukraine.
Mining companies toil in obscurity despite key role in global economy
Source: RIMES. As of 3/16/22. Mining companies represented (from largest to smallest) include BHP, Rio Tinto, Vale, Glencore, Freeport, Anglo American and Newmont.
In addition to underinvestment, another factor that could lead to higher commodity prices over the long term is the worldwide push for sustainable energy sources, Upton adds. Electricity, in particular, has become a favored resource. The expansion of the power grid — along with the rapid adoption of electric vehicles — will require lots of copper, nickel and other key metals.
China: A counterbalance to rising prices?
On the flip side, China’s slowing economy could act as a counterbalance to keep commodity prices in check. As the largest importer of raw materials, China consumes more than half the world’s iron ore, coal and copper supplies. When China’s economy slumps, the global commodities complex tends to sputter.
China’s close trading relationship with the European Union could also expose it to a wartime recession in Europe if the war in Ukraine drags on. Moreover, China is dealing with a COVID-19 resurgence that could further hamper the economy as the government renews restrictions on travel and entertainment.

“Even before the latest COVID outbreak, China’s economy was decelerating or at least stabilizing at a very low rate of growth,” says Stephen Green, a Capital Group economist who covers Asia. “Things are likely to get worse before they get better, and a sufficiently bad recession could cause commodity prices to fall.”
China’s central bank will probably cut interest rates soon, Green notes, while most other central banks around the world are moving in the opposite direction.
Investment implications: Inflation hedge
Regardless of where markets go from here, the current price surge confirms, once again, that commodities are an effective hedge against inflation. That’s not surprising since those very commodities — oil and gas, for instance — feed into many aspects of the global economy and can help to fuel inflation, which is currently running at a 40-year high.
Historically speaking, energy — especially oil — has moved closely in line with inflation, as measured by the U.S. Consumer Price Index. Since oil is usually a major component of commodity-related indexes, the long-term correlation between commodity prices and inflation is high.
No surprise: Commodities are an excellent hedge against inflation
Sources: Capital Group, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Refinitiv Datastream, Standard & Poor's, U.S. Department of Labor. Data shown from 1/31/89 to 2/28/22.
However, it’s also important to note that there are big differences between major categories of commodities. Oil and gas, metals, food and agricultural products often follow their own cycles.
Investors seeking an inflation hedge should keep that in mind, says Capital Group economist Jared Franz. “It all depends on the source of the inflation,” he notes.
“Unsurprisingly, the energy sector tends to do well when inflation is rising because energy price increases, especially for gasoline, can be quickly passed on to consumers,” Franz says. “That’s not always the case with other commodities, where price increases can be absorbed as they move through the production chain.”

From a financial perspective, the February 24 Russian invasion took markets utterly by surprise. The global economy, already reeling from high inflation, suddenly faced dire new threats, including a severe energy shortage, a growing refugee crisis and the potential for a protracted war in eastern Europe.
The conflict also carries wide-ranging geopolitical implications for the future of European cooperation, the changing posture of U.S. foreign policy toward Russia and China, and the reversal of globalization trends that have transformed the world since the end of the Cold War.

The West is united
Sanctions pose a dilemma for EU policymakers
Gas is more challenging than oil for Europe’s economy
Invasion of Ukraine could mark turning point for cybersecurity
Analyzing the U.S. defense scenario
The West is united
John Emerson, former U.S. ambassador to Germany
The transatlantic alliance has not been this united since the aftermath of 9/11. It’s quite remarkable how quickly, after years of skepticism and finger-pointing — whether it was over NATO funding, the imposition of sanctions after Russia began the Ukraine war back in 2014, Brexit or the Trump administration’s America First agenda — Europe and the United States have come together in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked war in Europe.
For more than two decades, the U.S. has unsuccessfully urged Germany to ramp up its defense budget, kill the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and reduce its energy dependence on Russian gas. Yet, within 72 hours of Russia commencing its invasion of Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz signaled a radical shift in multiple sacred pillars of German foreign policy: Defense spending will quickly exceed 2% of German GDP, including an immediate €100 billion infusion; German-made weapons can now be sent to Ukraine; and Nord Stream 2 has been halted.
Historically neutral Switzerland has stunningly agreed to adopt all European Union (EU) sanctions against Russia, including freezing Russian funds in Swiss banks. Even traditional supporters of Russia, such as Miloš Zeman, president of the Czech Republic, have condemned the attack and called for harsh sanctions.
International sanctions are mounting against Russia
Sources: Capital Group, Council of the European Union, U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, U.S. Department of the Treasury, U.S. State Department. As of March 7, 2022. Note: SWIFT is the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, which runs a messaging and payment system used by more than 11,000 financial institutions. Golden passports refer to residence permits that can be made available to foreign nationals and their immediate family via certain citizenship-by-investment programs.
We should anticipate significant Russian retaliation for these unprecedented sanctions. This could include severely reducing or even cutting off oil and gas exports to sanctioning nations, as well as restricting exports of titanium and other critical metals. While curtailing oil and gas sales to sanctioning nations would deprive Russia of needed revenue, China would presumably fill some of that gap — at fire sale prices. Moreover, Putin has used the time since the imposition of Western sanctions in response to his 2014 annexation of Crimea to build up Russian cash reserves and enhance Russian resilience.
Furthermore, we should prepare for the possibility of major cyberattacks on European and U.S. communications, energy and financial systems.
The Germans are preparing for a reduction of Russian gas exports, making plans to backfill with imports of liquid natural gas (LNG). This will be complicated by Germany’s failure over the past several years to complete construction of regasification facilities at its North Sea ports. There is little doubt that energy costs in Europe are likely to skyrocket, which are expected to be inflationary and dampen growth.
All that said, Putin clearly miscalculated on two fronts. First, the fact that the West would come together as quickly as it did, despite European reliance on Russian energy, the newly elected government in Germany, and potentially distracting domestic challenges faced by President Biden, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron.
Second, Putin miscalculated the intensity of Ukrainian resistance from both the military and civilians.
Notwithstanding all that, sadly, in the end, I think we could end up with an ugly “peace,” with Russia expanding its control over eastern Ukraine after having severely damaged the country’s national infrastructure. It is hard to see how Putin backs down at this point, absent massive domestic opposition within Russia. I expect this war will get worse before it gets better.
Pandemic, inflation, war: It’s been a tough start to the year

Sanctions pose a dilemma for EU policymakers
Robert Lind, European economist
This week, the U.S. announced expanded economic sanctions against Russia, banning imports of oil and gas, and the U.K. quickly followed suit, banning Russian oil. But the EU, which counts on Russia for a significantly larger portion of its energy supply, has not moved as forcefully, vowing only to cut its gas imports by two thirds within a year.
A full energy embargo on Russia would be extremely painful for the major European economies, especially Germany and Italy and smaller countries in central and eastern Europe that depend on Russian gas imports. In the short term, the EU should be able to cope with offsetting imports of LNG. But the bigger challenge will come during the summer when gas is being stockpiled for winter. Higher prices will make it even harder.
Analysis by the European Central Bank (ECB) and others show that a significant reduction in gas supply would have substantial negative effects on the euro zone’s GDP. For instance, the ECB estimates a 10% reduction would reduce euro zone GDP by around three quarters of a percentage point. Given that Russian imports account for around 40% of EU gas supply, an energy embargo could depress GDP by 3% to 4% relative to the pre-war baseline.
Energy prices spike amid Russia-Ukraine conflict
Source: Refinitiv Datastream. As of 3/4/22.
Unsurprisingly, the EU is wary of implementing sanctions that could have such a damaging impact on its economy. But if the recent spike in oil and gas prices continues or is protracted, the European economy will suffer negative supply shock even if there is no embargo. Alongside steep energy prices, we are seeing higher prices for other commodities related to the global food supply chain. Prices are also rising sharply for fertilizer and building materials. At the same time, in the absence of an embargo, higher energy prices will boost Russia’s export earnings, mitigating the effects of the economic and financial sanctions.
In the light of extreme uncertainty, I expect the ECB to avoid giving a clear signal that it will end its asset purchases. It will also have to closely monitor the inflationary shock this conflict brings. There is a growing risk of stagflation in Europe. Central banks would want to monitor any signs of inflation expectations so they don’t fall behind. I think they will continue to signal a removal of monetary accommodation, but at a much more cautious pace.
Gas is more challenging than oil for Europe’s economy
Craig Beacock, equity investment analyst covering U.S. and Canadian oil refiners
There’s an important distinction between oil and gas that seems likely to impact Europe and could ripple through the global economy, given the region’s standing as a major manufacturing and industrial base for automobiles, airplanes and chemicals. Oil is easier to supply and ship around the world when regions experience supply disruptions. Natural gas, on the other hand, is much less fungible. It is far more difficult to transport, whether through pipelines or LNG liquefaction infrastructure. So, if Russian supply is curtailed and Europe faces major shortages, it would be challenging to secure replacement supplies. This would certainly be a blow to Germany, which is a large user of gas for power generation.
In the commodities market, oil and gas prices have reacted very differently. While oil prices usually dominate headlines, the spike in gas prices has been more staggering. For example, European natural gas prices recently skyrocketed, trading at the equivalent of about $100 per million cubic feet of gas. That’s roughly equivalent to $600 for a barrel of oil. This underscores the disparity in how these commodities are transported around the world.
I expect CEOs of oil companies and others in the industry to play a role in alleviating this crisis. In the U.S., I anticipate production to grow to 500,000 to one million barrels a day. Trading prices have recently climbed to nearly $140 a barrel. I don’t think oil producers want prices at this level because it creates volatility and destroys demand. In my view, most oil stocks are priced for the commodity to trade in the range of $60 to $70 a barrel.
I do not expect this to significantly derail the world’s shift to green energy, but I do think it shows how the policy lines around energy security and sustainability could change, especially in Europe. Going forward, I expect policymakers will put a much greater emphasis on balancing the environmental side of things with the social ramifications of what could happen if they do not shore up energy security and insure they have the right supplies from the right partners.
Prior to the invasion of Ukraine, equity markets had been signaling to oil companies a preference for dividends and buybacks and less investment in pumping oil — partly because many such projects over the past decade had poor returns on capital. Oil companies have ample cash flow, and if capital expenditures are increased, they should have sufficient funds to provide both dividends and share buybacks.

Invasion of Ukraine could mark turning point for cybersecurity
Julien Gaertner, equity investment analyst covering cybersecurity
As the war in Ukraine unfolds, cyberwarfare is likely to play a role. I suspect we will be confronted with some incredibly ugly realities. My initial assessment is that this will support increased cybersecurity spending in the near term, but it will more likely be a meaningful inflection point for the industry. The Overton window — the range of policies politically acceptable to the mainstream population at a given time — around cyberwarfare as a tool in international relations could open wide and expose incredible weaknesses in U.S. and EU security.
Most U.S. critical infrastructure assets fail even basic cybersecurity protocols and penetration testing. I feel reasonably good about the U.S.’s large financial institutions’ security and the tech companies, but that’s about it. Energy and utility companies in both the U.S. and Europe have substantially underinvested in cybersecurity — and many remain vulnerable.
Against this backdrop I think cybersecurity investments have strong potential for two reasons: 1) the spending outlook and 2) the fundamental change in industry structure that allows for platform formation and hence more sustainable growth.
In the short term, I think accelerating cybersecurity budgets among corporations, as well as federal and state governments, is a near certainty. And if the situation in Ukraine escalates, I think there is a chance for more pronounced long-term changes.
The single biggest change could be a substantially different regulatory environment. Federal and state laws could become extremely prescriptive about minimum cybersecurity standards, especially in industries relevant to national security or those that impact the public. We could see an enormous investment cycle, specifically in the energy and utility sectors. We could see a massive cybersecurity investment cycle and possibly an acceleration in cloud migrations in Europe as well.
Analyzing the U.S. defense scenario
Shane Fogarty, investment analyst covering defense and other industries
Given the inherent difficulty of predicting geopolitical events, one has to plan for a range of outcomes for the U.S. defense complex. Assuming Putin stays in power after this war ends, I believe U.S. defense spending will accelerate from 2% to 3% year-over-year growth to 4% to 5% year-over-year growth over the next three years.
The U.S. defense budget growth drives U.S. defense stock prices. In addition to better fundamentals ahead, defense stocks are still cheap — and consensus estimates could be too low. My belief is that these events will be significantly more impactful for European defense than for the U.S., but I can still pencil out double-digit base case returns for the entire defense group from current levels.
The setup today is supportive of this sector given the full-scale invasion of Ukraine coupled with the reaction from Germany, which announced it is substantially increasing defense spending. EU countries are taking Russia’s actions seriously. It is not clear how the U.S. government will react as it relates to defense spending, but I think it’s reasonable that we could see 4% to 5% growth from current levels, given the need to modernize the force and compete with Russia and China. U.S. defense spending as a percentage of GDP, currently 3.2%, is near an all-time low versus the 4% to 5% we have seen during periods of heightened threat levels or war, leaving a lot of headroom for budget growth in the U.S.

Talha Khan, political economist
There is no shortage of tragic events unfolding in Ukraine — from the loss of life to the shattering of international peace accords to the economic damage suffered on all sides of the conflict. But if there is a silver lining to this catastrophe, it may be found among the growing chorus of nations joining to oppose Vladimir Putin’s military aggression.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has managed to do in one week what many observers of Europe have agonized over for decades: It has singularly united the European Union. Along with the United States and NATO, Western democracies haven’t been this closely aligned in purpose since the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The most profound shift happened over the weekend with new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz signaling radical changes in nearly every sacred pillar of German foreign policy. Among other extraordinary measures, Scholz announced a one-time increase of €100 billion in defense spending and committed to allocate more than 2% of Germany’s gross domestic product to annual defense spending.
Other European nations have signaled their resolve in various ways, including shipping weapons to Ukraine, accepting Ukrainian refugees and looking for alternatives to Russian oil and gas supplies. Russia is a major trading partner for Europe, and it remains to be seen whether the continent can forego key Russian commodities given there are no easy substitutes.
Russia remains one of the world’s largest energy producers

Will this new-found European unity persevere once the Russian threat has passed? I believe it will. It must endure if the EU expects to thrive in a brave new world that has shifted from 30 years of relative peace and cooperation to populist politics, heightened trade tensions and outright military conflict.
Geopolitics has returned as a major driver of world events. Political leaders and investors alike have no choice but to confront that reality.
The U.S. economy, Fed rate hikes and the “R” word
Darrell Spence, U.S. economist
While the threat to Europe’s economy is far greater, the U.S. economy probably won’t emerge from this conflict unscathed. Rising energy prices were a problem prior to the invasion of Ukraine and now are moving higher as global markets contemplate a world without Russia’s vast oil and gas supplies.
That could very well lead to higher U.S. inflation, which is already running hot. Price increases among food, energy, and other goods and services essentially rob U.S. consumers of their purchasing power. That can put a damper on consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity.
Could it be bad enough to push the U.S. into recession? I’d put the chances at 25% to 30% by late 2022 or early 2023. The R word is a much bigger issue for Europe, of course, because of its proximity to the crisis and dependence on Russian trade, particularly in the energy sector. Europe is more exposed than the U.S., but both economies could falter if the conflict isn’t resolved soon.
Trade with Russia is a key component of the European economy

With the U.S. Federal Reserve poised to raise interest rates later this month, some market participants are wondering if the Ukraine crisis might give Fed officials a reason to keep rates near zero. Stocks rallied late last week partly on this sentiment, but I don’t see it happening.
The Fed is in a tough spot. With U.S. inflation hitting a 40-year high of 7.5% in January — and a war-related energy shock potentially pushing it even higher — Fed officials have no choice in my view but to raise rates at their March 15-16 meeting. In an ideal world, they could pause. But at this level of inflation, I don’t believe they have the luxury. That said, the conflict probably means a hike of 50 basis points is off the table. Rather, a more moderate 25 basis point increase is likely.
Fed officials have clearly telegraphed their intention to tighten monetary policy. Investors should expect them to do so.

Stay focused on long-term investment goals
Jody Jonsson, portfolio manager
The invasion of Ukraine is a shock to the system. It represents an overthrow of the world order we have known for the last 30 years. Markets had a hard time anticipating how this would play out and couldn’t imagine what actually happened. These events further add to the negative investor sentiment present due to rising energy prices, higher inflation and signs of slowing global economic growth.
Since the beginning of the year, we’ve been in an environment where price-to-earnings multiples are experiencing a significant correction, especially at the frothiest ends of the market. If the crisis in Ukraine eventually causes central banks to refrain from raising interest rates, that could be positive for some companies with solid earnings growth that are reasonably valued, especially if oil is not an input for them. With oil prices above $100 a barrel now, that will be a major headwind for energy-dependent companies.
I’m also growing more concerned about the banking sector, particularly European banks. The economic outlook for Europe has deteriorated significantly in recent days. I think that creates more credit risk and raises the question of whether we are heading toward a recession later this year or next.
Market shocks have often been followed by market gains

It’s important to remember, however, that long-term investors can still find opportunity in the midst of chaos — be it war, inflation, or recession. There are still many companies that are growing and thriving and innovating, so that’s where I focus most of my time and energy.
My primary message for investors is to stay committed to your long-term investment goals. Don’t be disoriented by moments of crisis. Remember that markets are resilient and have powered through many challenges. Now is the time to evaluate your portfolio, stay focused on your path and try not to let external events derail your objectives.

220,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/russia-ukraine-conflict-threatens-global-economy.html,Russia-Ukraine conflict threatens global economy,Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"February 24, 2022","Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has triggered a swift response from U.S. and European governments. The imposition of economic sanctions is dominating the financial pages, but there are two other aspects of this crisis that I believe will have a more profound impact on the world economy. The first is the rising price of oil, which is now above $100 a barrel. We know from previous instances of geopolitical uncertainty, such as when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, higher oil prices can have a significant drag on global economic activity.
From a European perspective, the more serious concern is what's happened to natural gas prices, which are already elevated. This reflects the concern that we will see a significant disruption of Russian gas supplies to the European Union. Ongoing geopolitical instability will likely push gas prices even higher. This will be especially problematic for countries such as Germany and Italy, two of Europe’s largest economies.
The major European economies have already experienced a steep rise in energy prices. Oil prices tend to feed through quickly to consumer prices. But the pass-through of gas prices from wholesale to retail varies, especially given support from governments seeking to protect consumers. Recent increases likely will continue to feed into consumer prices over the next few months.
Equity markets have historically powered through geopolitical events

Germany’s announcement that it would not certify Nord Stream 2, a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, does not have any direct impact on supply as it’s not yet operational. Still, it’s possible we could see more significant disruption to Europe’s supply if Russia retaliates by restricting exports to the EU. This would hurt the Russian economy as well, of course, but Russia has built up its currency reserves to protect against such an eventuality.
Another pressing issue is what elevated commodity prices could mean for central bank policy.

We may be in for another negative supply shock, which effectively raises inflation and depresses economic growth. I believe the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will proceed more cautiously in terms of tightening monetary policy. Both will likely wait to see how financial markets and commodity prices react. Ultimately, I think the Fed will raise interest rates but perhaps do so more gradually than markets anticipated a week ago.
I also expect European governments to step up support for households and companies to protect them from higher energy prices, reinforcing measures taken over the past few months. In a worst-case scenario of severe supply disruptions and elevated prices, governments might have to curtail energy demand and compensate affected companies and industries.
While the major European economies can cope with short-term supply disruptions and price volatility, there are growing concerns about the security of Europe’s energy supply in the medium term. It will be challenging for the EU to rebuild its gas storage in the spring and summer if there are continuing supply disruptions and demand remains strong.
As countries phase out coal the need for gas has increased. The German government has also confirmed the closure of its remaining nuclear plants by the end of 2022. There will be mounting pressure on European governments to continue their build-out of other energy sources. But this will take time, leaving Europe vulnerable to any further deterioration in relations with Russia.

222,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/market-volatility-long-term-opportunity.html,Is there opportunity in this stock market volatility?,Market Volatility,"January 26, 2022","Fears of persistent inflation and tightening monetary policy have rocked markets since the start of the year. More richly valued sectors like technology suffered the initial brunt of the sell-off as their valuations came under close scrutiny with the expectation of higher interest rates. The volatility spread to blue chip stocks with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index briefly entering correction territory on Monday before whipsawing back. On Wednesday, markets gyrated again before closing nearly flat as the Federal Reserve hinted it may move more quickly than previously expected to hike rates and shrink its balance sheet.
Renewed geopolitical tensions, ranging from the Russia/Ukraine border crisis to U.S.-China relations, are also fueling market uncertainty and are likely to keep some pressure on asset prices in the months ahead. While volatility is likely to persist, several of our investment professionals believe markets are healthier than many people realize.
Below are some of their views on how the market correction and Fed policy changes may provide an opportunity to adjust portfolios, taking selective action where they have long-term convictions to position portfolios for the next three to five years.
Growth sectors still present opportunities
The severity of the market correction reflects an increasingly risk-off investor sentiment, hitting expensively valued growth stocks and speculative assets like cryptocurrencies particularly hard. Meanwhile, more value-oriented stocks in areas of energy, financials and consumer staples have fared better, suggesting that a longer term market rotation may be taking root.
The NASDAQ Composite fell 7.6% last week, suffering its biggest decline since the start of the pandemic. As of January 26, 44% of stocks in the NASDAQ Composite were down 50% or more from their 52-week highs.
How returns have differed
Sources: Capital Group, MSCI, NASDAQ, Refinitiv Datastream. Year-to-date return performance is based on total returns relative to December 31, 2021. Returns are as of market close January 21, 2022.
Netflix was among the hardest hit last week when its share price fell 22% on January 21 after reporting lower-than-expected subscriber growth. This triggered deeper concerns that even industry giants would not be spared from eroding demand, tougher competition and potentially deteriorating earnings. Within the technology sector, recent price action indicates investor preference for high-quality, low price-to-earnings (P/E) companies over the higher valued companies which tend to be more sensitive to rising rates.
But volatility in the share prices of emergent companies is to be expected. Over the past 15 years, some fast-growing companies have experienced multiple corrections in share price. Those investors who weathered the market turbulence and remained invested would have realized attractive returns however.

The Fed may accelerate tightening despite volatility spikes
— Tom Hollenberg, Fixed Income Portfolio Manager, and Margaret Steinbach, Fixed Income Investment Director
Today's news from the Fed was a bit more hawkish than the market anticipated but it doesn't change our outlook for the year. We continue to expect at least four (25 basis point) rate hikes and think inflation is likely to persist well above the Fed’s target this year. We have been thinking that a faster pace of rate hikes can’t be ruled out, and Powell’s comments at the press conference confirmed this.
The last time the Fed hiked, it did so in 25 basis point increments each quarter. That is still probably its most likely course of action this time, but given how far above target inflation is, there's no reason why the Fed would want to limit its ability to hike faster if it needs to. In his comments to the press, Powell did not dismiss the possibility that the Fed would speed up tightening or rule out the possibility of raising rates in 50 basis point increments.
Investors could be in for a turbulent ride over the next few quarters. It may not take many rate hikes or much quantitative tightening to spur more equity market volatility. But the view of Capital Group's rates team is that the Federal Reserve is not likely to let the stock market throw it off the path of tightening, like it did in the last hiking cycle. If you go back to 2017 and 2018, when the Fed hiked 175 basis points, it had space to reverse course when asset prices plunged because inflation was below target. Today that is not the case.

This would present a tricky dilemma for the central bank. It would be hard for the Fed to claim to be credible about achieving its dual mandate (of promoting price stability and full employment) if it backs off of its tightening schedule before inflation comes down.
In our core and core plus bond portfolios, we are positioning to help protect against the impact of higher interest rates through duration and yield curve positioning, as well as owning Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) as valuations still offer upside potential.
A market correction may not be lasting
— Darrell Spence, Economist
Although any period of monetary tightening can generate higher market volatility, U.S. equities could remain supported by earnings growth. And while valuations are high relative to history, they are not exorbitant considering current and projected levels of interest rates.
I believe that S&P 500 earnings can grow 8% to 10% in 2022, which is still a respectable rate considering the strong rebound in corporate earnings last year. In addition, while inflation is certainly a concern for overall economic conditions, it can be beneficial for earnings growth.
Recent data would seem to indicate that inflation may persist for longer than expected and the Fed could be forced into a more aggressive tightening cycle than previously anticipated. While history suggests that tighter monetary policy and higher rates almost always put downward pressure on equity valuations, what this means for market levels depends on earnings growth and how much it can offset a contraction in price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples.
In fact, perhaps contrary to conventional wisdom, the market has tended to rise in periods following initial increases in the federal funds rate. The exceptions to this are the inflationary periods of the 1970s and early 1980s, in addition to periods when the S&P 500 P/E ratio was more than 20 times earnings at the time of the initial tightening — periods which, of course, have some similarity to today.
However, inflation then was significantly worse and accompanied by a deep recession. In addition, interest rates in prior periods of high valuation were substantially higher. While this is no guarantee that the equity market won't decline when the Fed tightens, it does provide a bit more support than was evident during some of those historical episodes.
S&P 500 has mostly powered through initial Fed tightening cycles
Source: Capital Group. Data as of December 31, 2021. The nominal rate of return is the amount of money generated by an investment before factoring in expenses such as taxes and inflation. Real return is what is earned on an investment after accounting for taxes and inflation.
My base case scenario is for U.S. GDP to grow 2% to 3% in 2022 as fiscal stimulus wanes and monetary policy tightens. This slower — but still positive — economic growth should support an increase in corporate profits.
While we are not likely to see the outsized gains of 2021, single-digit equity returns still seem attainable as the market rises in line with, or slightly less than, earnings growth this year. They are likely to be accompanied by more volatility, and we are starting to see that in markets. And while a correction is never out of the realm of possibility in any given year or economic environment, we do not expect a systemic market decline given current economic conditions, earnings strength and level of interest rates.

223,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/bitcoin-pros-cons.html,The pros and cons of Bitcoin,Currencies,"December 22, 2021","Rarely has an emerging technological development captured as much attention as Bitcoin in such a short period of time.
The debate over Bitcoin — and the cryptocurrency craze it has spawned — runs the gamut from advocates who see it as the future of finance to skeptics who compare it to a classic pyramid scheme. As the arguments intensify, so have the stakes: The market capitalization of the crypto universe has increased from roughly $200 billion in 2019 to more than $2.2 trillion at the end of 2021.
The rapid growth of the crypto industry has inspired a lively debate among Capital Group’s investment professionals, as well. To provide a glimpse into these discussions, we are sharing thoughts from two of Capital’s brightest minds on the advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin.
Mark Casey, a portfolio manager with The Growth Fund of America®, provides the “pro” argument, while Douglas Upton, an equity analyst covering the metals and mining industry, provides the “con” rebuttal.
We start with perhaps the toughest question of all:
Given Bitcoin’s volatility, how can investors determine a reasonable price for it?
Mark Casey: Bitcoin's valuation is a real paradox. On the one hand, it’s an asset that can never produce earnings and, like all assets that can never produce earnings, it has an intrinsic value of zero. You can't do a discounted cash flow analysis of Bitcoin just as you can’t do a discounted cash flow analysis of gold, or a Stradivarius violin, or fine art, or any other form of collectible. Anything that can't produce earnings is only worth what other people will pay for it. And so, in a sense, the valuation is completely arbitrary.
On the other hand, I think Bitcoin might become one of the most valuable assets in the world. And the reason is, the unique properties of Bitcoin are almost universally interesting to everybody who interacts with money.
No one can create any more of it. There will always be a supply cap of 21 million bitcoins, so no person or government can dilute your position by printing more.
Bitcoin is the only form of money that can’t be censored. It’s available for use by anyone with an internet connection, and no one can stop you from sending or receiving a transaction.
It’s hard to confiscate. Your bitcoin is really just a password. You can carry it around in your head, or write it down, and take it with you across any border in the world. Unlike the money in your checking account, it can’t be confiscated by the government or creditors.
Half the people in the world live under authoritarian regimes that can block them from using the money system or remove money directly from their bank accounts, so I think there's tremendous appeal to this type of asset. There's roughly $600 trillion of wealth in the world. If Bitcoin gains a larger share of that, the price can go up a lot.
Douglas Upton: I’m kind of jealous, actually. I wish I had thought of creating something that’s divisible, with rules that can’t be changed and a limited supply — and then convince people to buy it from me. I honestly feel like I would have been laughed out of the room. Mark puts Bitcoin in the same category as fine art and fancy violins. You can always question the valuation, but the scarcity of those items is genuine. Whereas the scarcity of Bitcoin is artificial; someone just made it up.
When I look at the history of Bitcoin, it was originally established as a way of sending money over the internet, and it's bad at that. It’s very inefficient. Over time, somehow the thesis changed to: “It’s a store of value.” As an analyst who has followed gold for many decades, I feel like I've seen this movie before.
“The financial markets don’t need Bitcoin, but Bitcoin needs the financial markets.”
In my first job I worked on the biggest bullion desk in the world. We would say, ""Well, if everybody put 5% of their assets in gold, the gold price would be a lot higher."" And now here we are with Bitcoin. It’s the same argument.
The price of Bitcoin is set by the financial markets — by people who are buying it solely because they think other people will pay more for it in the future. That sounds a lot like a pyramid scheme to me. The financial markets don’t need Bitcoin, but Bitcoin needs the financial markets. People can make a lot of money and they can lose a lot of money, but putting an intellectual framework around Bitcoin’s valuation is near impossible.
What’s driving Bitcoin’s price surge?
Sources: Capital Group, Refinitiv Eikon. As of 12/19/2021.
Is Bitcoin an effective hedge against inflation?
Casey: I think Bitcoin will prove to be an excellent inflation hedge. If you look around the world, there are about $100 trillion of assets held in various forms of cash. All of it is essentially losing purchasing power over time because governments tend to print fiat currency faster than the economy grows.
There's also about $125 trillion of bonds and about $20 trillion of them have negative yields, so investors know they will lose money. There are many more bonds where inflation is probably going to be larger than the coupon. So investors think they're going to earn 3%, but they will actually lose 3% if inflation turns out to be 6%.
“Bitcoin is the only form of money in human history where you can't change the monetary policy and you can't print more.”
Some of those people are going to look at their portfolios and say, “It would be nice to own something that can actually hold its value or goes up over time.” They are going to look at their cash holdings and wonder why they are losing purchasing power in fiat currency. (The answer is money printing.) And some percentage of them will come to Bitcoin, because it is the only form of money in human history where you can't change the monetary policy and you can't print more.
Upton: First, throughout most of history, negative interest rates have been rare. Holding fiat currency normally earns you interest over time. Mark’s argument only makes sense in a world with negative real interest rates. That may be the specific circumstance we are in right now, but throughout history, real interest rates have been positive the vast majority of the time.
Second, if you’re looking to avoid currency risk, then the key decision is to get your money out of that currency. If you’re in Lebanon, for instance, and the Lebanese pound has just collapsed, you would have been fine whether you moved into gold, Bitcoin, the U.S. dollar, or New York real estate.
Third, there are lots of tangible assets that can work well as a hedge against inflation, including nearly every commodity you can think of. Commodities have been an effective inflation hedge over many cycles. The point is, you have choices and many of them have a much longer track record than Bitcoin.
Is Bitcoin mining bad for the environment?
Upton: Bitcoin mining uses more electricity than some countries, and most countries around the world are working hard to reduce their carbon footprint. Any use of energy that doesn't go toward the sustenance of people I think is questionable and should be examined closely.
According to various estimates, Bitcoin mining uses over 100 terawatt-hours of electricity per year. If you purchase that energy even in a low cost electricity system, it’s going to run $3 billion to $4 billion a year. We should think of this amount, as well as the other costs associated with Bitcoin mining, as a negative carry, similar to currency depreciation. It’s material and it’s meaningful.
Society has to ask: What value is Bitcoin adding that justifies such a high cost and such a large carbon footprint? In my view, Bitcoin only creates value for a small number of people. It’s an easy win for the planet to say we don’t really need this.
Bitcoin mining consumes more power than some nations
Sources: Capital Group, Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, U.S. Energy Information Association (EIA). ""TWh"" refers to terawatt-hours. Latest available country figures are from 2019, while Bitcoin's estimated energy consumption is based upon trailing 12-month energy consumption, as of November 2021.
Casey: On the contrary, I think Bitcoin has a great energy consumption story. The software that drives the system is designed to thrive regardless of the number of miners, the price of computer chips, the price of energy, or the price of Bitcoin. The system is adaptable, and it flexes up and down based on these variables.
Compared to other industrial activities, Bitcoin is one of the greenest industries on the planet. And it’s getting greener all the time because Bitcoin miners are uniquely positioned to take advantage of intermittent forms of energy, such as a temporary oversupply of hydropower during the rainy season.
Today, Bitcoin miners purchase one tenth of 1% of all the energy in the world. So that means 99.9% of the world’s energy is going to other things. Even in a very bullish case where Bitcoin rises to $1.5 million per coin over the next 10 years, miners will still be purchasing less than 1% of the world’s energy. Bitcoin’s energy use is negligible. It will always be nothing more than a rounding error.
What’s the risk that governments will ban Bitcoin?
Upton: I think there is a very real risk that governments will eventually decide to ban Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies or severely restrict their use. We’ve already seen it happen in China, and it could happen elsewhere if governments feel like they are losing control of the financial system.
There is an interesting precedent, of which Mark reminded me. In 1933, the U.S. government banned private ownership of gold. That was during the Great Depression when the government was looking for every lever it could to control the supply and cost of money. For governments and central banks around the world, I think losing control is unacceptable.
Bitcoin’s rapid growth could lead to its own unwinding.
Casey: I agree that some governments might try to ban Bitcoin. I view this as the biggest potential headwind to adoption and the best multi-year bear case, but it’s not a decisive bear case. I don’t think governments can extinguish Bitcoin — and attempts to ban it might actually accelerate adoption by people who are already skeptical of heavy-handed government intervention.
Bitcoin was designed with a decentralized architecture precisely to prevent anyone from being able to control the future of the system — and that includes governments. Bitcoin operates outside government boundaries, and I don’t think it could be banned, although such a move by the U.S. or the European Union would certainly hurt prices in the short term. Over the long term, however, it could cause demand for Bitcoin to skyrocket.
Bitcoin’s rapid growth has spawned many crypto competitors
Sources: Capital Group, CoinMarketCap.com. As of 12/17/21. All figures are estimates and subject to change based on volatility in coin prices, circulating supply and foreign exchange rates. ""Market cap"" refers to market capitalization and is calculated based on current price multiplied by circulating supply as quoted on CoinMarketCap.com.
Will Bitcoin eventually fall prey to competition from other digital currencies?
Casey: Bitcoin is built on open-source software, so anyone can make a copy of it, change a few variables and launch a new type of coin. That experiment has taken place literally thousands of times. So every person who holds Bitcoin has had thousands of opportunities to sell it and buy some other cryptocurrency — perhaps one that has a higher supply cap than 21 million or a faster method to process new transactions.
What I find interesting is that so far, Bitcoin owners have considered these options to diversify and yet an overwhelming majority have said no. So I think Bitcoin is likely to survive in the same fundamental form that it exists today. It has seen plenty of competition over the past decade and it remains the king of the cryptocurrency realm.

224,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/fed-economy-outlook.html,"What the Fed pivot could mean for rates, inflation and the economy",Fed,"December 16, 2021","The Federal Reserve announced on December 15 that it will move more quickly to end its economic stimulus, doubling the rate at which it winds down (or tapers) its asset purchase program. This puts the Fed on track to stop buying bonds by March, and clears a path for it to raise interest rates shortly thereafter. Fed officials’ latest median projections indicate they may raise rates three times next year, and three more times in 2023.
Here are some top takeaways on the news and thoughts on the year ahead from Capital Group economist Darrell Spence and fixed income portfolio managers Ritchie Tuazon and Tim Ng.
1. Getting ready for rate hikes in 2022
Ritchie Tuazon and Tim Ng
The most important signal from speeding up the taper is that it opens the door to more 2022 rate hikes. But, while Fed policy changes are an inflection point that can rattle markets, it is important to keep this news in perspective. 
The Fed’s latest “dot plot” chart shows that most of its governors now anticipate three rate increases for 2022. This is big pivot from September, when only half of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee predicted rates would rise at all in 2022. It is also above market consensus of two hikes in 2022. Fed Chair Jerome Powell also indicated that the committee will start discussions on reducing the size of its balance sheet.
Now our base case is that the Fed will raise rates three times next year. Despite the hawkish tone of the announcement, stocks and TIPS did well after the announcement, and the yield curve steepened. If risk assets hold up and financial conditions remain loose, the Fed will have the green light to move even more aggressively to address inflation. 
Near term rate hike expectations have risen due to high inflation
Source: Federal Reserve. As of December 15, 2021.
The December 15 announcement also represents a hawkish shift from Powell, who was renominated by President Joe Biden in November for a second term. Powell had previously defended the view that the inflation we see today was “transitory” and would resolve itself, but he abandoned the term altogether in his statement this week.
In a press conference, Powell stated that November’s jobs report, which included upward revisions to prior jobs reports, coupled with November’s consumer price index (CPI) update, which showed a substantial increase to inflation, convinced him it was time to speed up the taper.
Powell noted that U.S. labor force participation numbers are still “disappointing” but said that he believes the economy is still making rapid progress toward maximum employment. “We have to make policy now,” he said. “And inflation is well above target. So, this is something we need to take into account.”
The Fed appears to be interpreting the Omicron COVID-19 variant as an inflationary impulse but does not appear to be too concerned about its risks. Powell said that people are learning to live with the virus despite recurring waves, suggesting the economic implications may be limited.
In addition to renominating Powell, Biden has also named new Fed Board appointees in recent weeks who are likely to tilt dovish, but we do not expect that they will rock the status quo and impede the new accelerated tapering schedule. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who has been among the most dovish members of the Federal Open Market Committee, was among the first to come out and say the taper should be sped up.
Others who are considered doves — such as Lael Brainard, who has been nominated to be the Fed’s new vice chair, and John Williams, president of the New York Fed — have also been making speeches indicating that, if inflation is above mandate, they will do what is necessary to keep it under control. This concern over inflation is bipartisan, so there is likely to be little political resistance to moving rates up to fight inflation.
At the end of the day, however, we are still going to have low rates and low yields for the foreseeable future. The Fed’s longer run dot plot projections did not move, and calculations from the Atlanta Fed show the market expects the federal funds rate to be around 1.5% at the end of 2024, which is still a highly accommodative environment.
2. U.S. growth likely to slow down but stay solid
Darrell Spence
We see tempered growth for the United States in 2022 as fiscal stimulus wanes and the Fed begins to remove accommodation. Our base case is 2.5% to 3% GDP growth, which is still a respectable rate. And although any period of monetary tightening can generate higher market volatility, we on the Capital Strategy Research (CSR) team expect risk assets to remain supported by strong earnings. Valuations are high relative to history, but they are not exorbitant considering the current, and projected, level of interest rates. A mild correction is not out of the realm of possibility, but we do not expect a systemic market decline.
That said, there are likely to be more headwinds — in particular, inflation — hitting the economy in 2022 than there were in 2021. While this is not a complete surprise, given where we are in the post-COVID rebound, we will be watching closely for signs that they are exerting more of a drag on economic activity than currently expected as we move toward the end of the year.
3. Supply chain issues are set to persist
Darrell Spence
Currently, stimulus-induced demand is meeting COVID-restricted supply, and this is creating imbalances that are keeping inflation elevated.
With no more stimulus checks, federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) grants, emergency unemployment benefits, or debt and eviction moratoriums, it seems likely that demand will soften. Where supply goes is more uncertain. If COVID-induced bottlenecks clear up and supply increases, a new equilibrium could occur with inflation around pre-pandemic levels. This is the “transitory” scenario the Fed had been assuming. 
While much is still unknown about Omicron, its arrival does suggest that COVID will be with us for a while longer. As such, the “transitory” period — i.e., the period where COVID is impacting supply and generating inflationary pressures — has likely been extended another six to 12 months, and there is a risk that inflation begins to have a more negative impact on economic activity during that period.
Unfortunately, there is very little the Fed can do to increase supply. Rather, to reduce inflation, it would need to suppress demand, which essentially means putting the economy into a slowdown or recession. However, we still do not know how willing it will be to push down an economy, particularly one that may not be at their definition of full employment, just to break the back of inflation. 
All that said, if one has a multiyear timeframe, “transitory” still looks like a strong possibility. Many of the factors that caused inflation to remain low in recent decades — in particular, globalization and advances in technology — are still in play. These factors should help moderate inflation in the long term, but in the near term, COVID and its related issues are likely to dominate the inflation outlook.

4. Equity markets are likely to stay resilient
Darrell Spence
We currently expect that equity markets will be able to ride this out next year, as slow but positive economic growth should support an increase in corporate profits. Understandably, there is a lot of concern about valuations, as the market price-to-earnings ratio does look high relative to history. However, it has been that way for years, yet the market has continued to march higher. Had one stayed out of the market due to concerns about valuations, they would have missed a lot of opportunity.
One cannot look at valuations in a vacuum. They need to be looked at in the context of the interest rate environment. The fact is that low rates can support higher valuations (assuming the economy is not in distress, and we do not think it is). Looking ahead to 2022, it is possible that tighter monetary policy, and higher rates, could put some downward pressure on valuations, but we also expect that an ongoing recovery in earnings could offset much, if not all, of that contraction. 
What level of interest rates might be problematic?
Sources: Capital Group, FactSet, Federal Reserve, Standard & Poor's. Dots represent monthly data from January 31, 1950, to August 31, 2021.
As an aside, there is a school of thought that suggests rising yields will not start to exert significant downward pressure on the equity market until the 10-year Treasury yield reaches 5.0%, because that is the level at which the correlation between bond yields and equity prices has reversed, twice, over time. This flip-flop in correlation could be total coincidence, but it could also have occurred because yields above 5.0% indicate that inflation has become a dominant factor driving valuations. If there is anything to the 5.0% threshold, then the current 10-year yield, at 1.4%, appears to be a long way away from a level that has, at least historically, created a headwind for the equity market.
While we will likely not see the gains that we have seen over the past year or so, we on the CSR team believe single-digit equity returns to be attainable as the market rises in line with, or slightly less than, earnings growth in 2022.

The prevailing school of thought is that inflationary pressures will diminish once economies are past the post-COVID recovery, and Europe will return to its decade-old pattern of low growth, low inflation and low interest rates. My view is that the pandemic has brought about changes in consumer behavior and the political climate that, when combined with secular shifts that were already underway, will likely result in a shift to higher inflation in the range of 2% to 3% in Europe over the next few years. I expect eurozone real gross domestic product to increase to around 5% in 2021 and 4.5% in 2022, with the U.K. economy growing by around 7% in 2021 and 5% in 2022.
Eurozone inflation has recently climbed above its medium-term target of 2%

Interest rates could shift moderately higher, but that will depend largely on the reaction of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BOE). The ECB has held its main refinancing operations rate at zero since March 2016 and does not seem likely to raise rates in the foreseeable future. It did, however, begin slowing the pace at which it is buying bonds through its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) in September. It is likely to let the program expire in March 2022.
The BOE cut its benchmark bank rate to 0.1% in March 2020. Markets are pricing in an expected rate hike of approximately 0.25% by the end of the year, with more hikes in 2022.
Here are six reasons why I expect to see higher inflation and faster growth in Europe over the next few years:

1. Structural shifts in energy will keep prices higher
Industry is booming in Germany and the U.K., so there has been a rise in demand for energy. At the same time, both cyclical and structural factors have lowered supply.
For natural gas, Europe is dependent on Russia and Norway, where there have been significant outages. That is partly due to politics and partly due to infrastructure, in terms of just not being able to get the gas into the rest of Europe. The shortages are also related to the fact that last winter was actually quite cold and thus Europe didn't build up any gas reserves.

WATCH
This combination of very strong demand and low reserves has been made worse by the slow pace of transition to renewable energy. Europe is still too reliant on fossil fuels. Wind and hydroelectric plants, for all kinds of reasons, haven't been producing enough electricity to meet base requirements. Europe needs to build out much more renewable energy capacity, which is going to take some time. And that means this supply problem is likely to be present for years to come.
I think the prices that we're seeing today are probably an overshoot. But even if they are an overshoot, the fact is that the demand and supply fundamentals will tell you that energy prices six months ago were just far too low. Given that energy has a weight of 9% in the eurozone consumer price index, these price increases will push up headline inflation rates over the next few months.
2. Consumers appear to keep their wallets open
Household savings have increased sharply as consumers have been housebound for a large part of the last 18 months. Now those savings are being released.
The EU household saving rate had tracked somewhere around 12% since 2008, before doubling in early 2020 as lockdowns swept the continent and the ECB unleashed the first wave of its €1.85 billion stimulus program.
Europe’s household gross saving rate surged during the pandemic
Sources: Eurostat, U.K. Office for National Statistics. Data as of October 18, 2021.
Before the pandemic, household consumption was heavily weighted toward services and away from durable goods, particularly in Europe and the U.S. People bought cars, refrigerators and bikes, but they spent most of their money on services like going out to restaurants and traveling. That flipped during the pandemic.
Economists are now wrestling with the question: Is this change in consumption a temporary thing and will we go back to normal pre-pandemic patterns? I think the honest answer is, we don't know.
If the demand for durables remains robust, it's arguable that there isn't enough capacity to produce what we need. And that's a long-term structural issue.
3. Labor shortages are likely to persist
There is also mounting evidence of acute labor shortages in some economies, which raises the probability that higher headline inflation rates could feed through to higher wage growth. German unions, for example, are sounding more determined in the run-up to the next round of pay negotiations in the spring. We have already seen a significant pickup in wage growth in the U.K. as the economy has reopened.
There was a significant exodus of labor away from the service sectors during the pandemic. The shift has been pronounced in economies like the U.K., Italy and Spain. A section of the labor force migrated from services to assembly jobs in manufacturing. And manufacturing has seen a huge upswing because demand has been so strong. So, there are labor shortages across industries. 
While the labor mismatch in the eurozone isn’t as pronounced as in the U.K., and wages are still growing only modestly, ECB policymakers are worried that labor shortages and effective wage indexation could lead to a sharp rise in wage growth in 2022.
4. Supply constraints are showing up across many industries
It's tempting to say the supply issues will go away. The fact is that we just don't know how long it will take to resolve them, and indeed, there is a much more fundamental structural problem in many markets.
Our equity analysts inform us some Asian countries are experiencing huge spikes in COVID cases and are mandatorily shutting down manufacturing facilities as a result. And there are also massive delays to load and unload cargo ships. The backlog of ships has grown so severe at the port of Felixstowe, which handles around 36% of the U.K.’s freight container volume, that Swedish shipping company Maersk has said it is diverting a third of its ships bound for the port elsewhere.
Bottlenecks started in the U.S. and China, where a COVID outbreak at one of its busiest ports resulted in a multiweek shutdown. Now the dysfunction is spreading to many other global ports that are providing overflow relief. This is resulting in multiweek delays in product deliveries for finished goods, and many manufacturers can’t even get the necessary parts to make their products in the first place.
5. Back to Keynes — Fiscal policies will remain stimulative
I believe we are close to a change in the policy regime that is a complete reversal of what we saw in the early 1980s with Thatcher and Reagan. I think we're now in a much more pragmatic world similar to the 1960s, where governments were more willing to use fiscal policy to do public investment.
The orthodoxy of the last 20 to 30 years has been that monetary policy is the primary instrument for managing demand, with fiscal policy playing a subordinate role. But if Germany, for instance, is spending €80 billion on public investment, that's 2% of its gross domestic product. If you get the same in France, Italy and maybe even the U.K., then that raises the growth potential of these economies in the medium to longer run.
In the West, we've seen a long-term downtrend in investment as a share of the economy. Partly that's about private investment, but there's also been significant underinvestment in public infrastructure.
Governments know they made mistakes after the global financial crisis when they tightened fiscal policy too quickly. I think they will be at pains not to repeat those errors.
6. Central banks don’t want to raise rates at the wrong time
Central banks’ response to the COVID crisis had been to pin the pedal flat to the floor and print money at a rate not seen before. Now, with Europe facing inflationary pressures that are also visible in other parts of the developed world, it appears the ECB is thinking about easing off the accelerator and the BOE is ready to step on the brakes.
Inflation surges across most of the G7
Source: OECD, as of October 15, 2021. Darker colors indicate higher inflation.
The BOE’s monetary policy committee signaled a hawkish turn in September with the publication of its policy meeting minutes. While they voted to maintain its current policy stance, there were some clear signals of an emerging tightening bias.
Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB, has indicated publicly that it is not planning to tighten. But the minutes of the ECB’s latest meeting also show some governing council members are growing concerned about upside risks to its inflation forecast.
It seems likely to me that both central banks will tighten before markets expect, and the BOE is likely to react more swiftly than the ECB. By moving early, central bankers hope they can avoid bigger inflation problems and more aggressive tightening later, which would be more of a threat to the recovery.
Central banks must determine to what extent higher prices will choke off demand and growth. I think that is where most central bankers are really scratching around for an answer. The challenge is that the traditional models of relationships between labor, inflation and prices have broken down.
The ECB appears to be particularly concerned with not repeating the mistakes of 2011, when it stymied growth by raising rates at the wrong time. The bigger risk, in my view, is that the bank could make exactly the opposite mistake. If the ECB leaves its policy too loose for too long there's a danger that, at some point, we could end up with an inflation problem that's much bigger than we have today.

228,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/china-economic-outlook-2022.html,China’s economy risks a sharp slowdown in growth,China,"October 20, 2021","Investors in China should prepare for a rough patch. The economy is slowing, and regulations are tightening in several industries. The economic cycle turned in June/July, based on the official Purchasing Managers Index readings and other indicators that we track. Heading into 2022, I think gross domestic product (GDP) growth will be considerably lower than the current consensus forecast of around 5%.
Here are a few reasons that lead me to this view:
1. Credit is tight in the real estate market
Primary real estate sales are about 15% of GDP, and the indirect demand the sector generates makes it even more important to the economy. And credit is tightening in the real estate sector. Home-buying restrictions could be loosened. But, with low inventories and contracting housing supply, any loosening could result in even higher house prices, undermining the government’s key policy objective that “housing is not for speculation.”
Evergrande, the country’s second-largest developer, is likely headed for a managed bankruptcy process. The unwinding will likely involve selling off Evergrande assets project by project to state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

WATCH
The government’s top priority is to protect those who pre-bought Evergrande apartments, which reportedly amounts to approximately 600,000 buyers. Suppliers to Evergrande are already being “paid” in the form of property that’s been cut in price by 20% to 30%, based on what my colleagues and I have heard from our sources.
But Evergrande is just the most obvious entity in a troubled sector. Dozens of medium-sized developers have weak cash flows and are having trouble obtaining bank loans or issuing debt. Some are slashing prices in order to raise cash. In the past, the larger developers would come in and buy the unfinished projects, but that’s unlikely now.
There’s also the likelihood of a property tax program that will be piloted in some cities. Many middle-class urban households own two properties, and this could dampen consumer demand, depending on the tax rate that may be set and its scope. 
China’s economy appears to be weakening
Source: FactSet. Latest available data as of September 30, 2021. An index reading of 50 signals no change since the previous month. Above 50 signals an increase (or improvement), below 50 a decrease (or deterioration). The greater the divergence from 50, the greater the rate of change signaled.
2. Consumer confidence is ebbing, and retail sales growth is slowing
Consumer confidence never fully recovered after China’s initial COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020. And neither did income growth, particularly for lower-income groups. Retail sales growth is still positive, but again, the pace of growth is declining. Car sales are also falling in absolute terms ­though that’s mostly due to supply disruptions due to a lack of components, according to our analysts who cover the sector. Youth employment in urban areas is pushing up, while overall surveyed employment still has not returned to its pre-COVID-19 base.
The government’s Common Prosperity agenda on improving life for the lower middle class could also result in a spate of taxes on property, inheritance, luxury and alcohol, which would impact a wide swath of the upper middle class, potentially further dampening consumer sentiment.
3. Heavy industry could see excess capacity, and industrial profits have softened
The real estate boom of 2018–2020 supported high levels of demand for steel. That, plus supply reforms that wiped out old and excess capacity in the mid-2010s, meant that heavy industry returned to health. With end demand contracting now, we could see some excess capacity return. The data is volatile, but the trend line shows that industrial profits are now below pre-COVID levels, which could dampen corporate capital investment in 2022.

Government has tools at its disposal to stimulate
No doubt, the government has tools at its disposal to stimulate the economy. China’s benchmark interest rate is 4%, which is very high compared to other economies, so the People’s Bank of China has room to lower rates. We could even see a 25 to 50 basis points cut in interest rates in the next few months.
The challenge authorities face is that, at a time when they want to continue to clamp down on housing and local government debt, cutting rates may be risky. Beijing also might worry about lowering rates when the rest of the world is hiking, potentially dampening capital inflows. So, while rate cuts might suggest significant loosening, I doubt they’ll be enough.
When Beijing has stimulated growth in previous cycles, it has usually both cut rates and told the banks to lend more, which creates end demand by stimulating the property and infrastructure sectors. But while property is paid for by households, infrastructure is paid for by local government-owned entities so it’s a de facto government liability.
This time, there’s much less room on the fiscal front with government debt, when properly measured, at more than 100% of GDP and rising rapidly. Beijing has tried to make this debt more transparent by funding more of it through public bonds, but it has not effectively curbed the still large “hidden debt.”
I also believe that, in the near term, Beijing is comfortable with sacrificing growth to achieve key strategic priorities.
While many are focused on the 20th Central Communist Party (CCP) Congress in fall 2022 as a reason to expect a stimulus package, I think the leadership now has its eyes on 2035–2040, when they envision being a strong and technologically advanced country. I believe the government is willing to take short-term pain for long-term gain.
CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping, in addition to wanting to deflate the property market, wants funding to flow to the regime’s strategic priorities ­environmental protection, electric vehicles, semiconductors and weapons. It’s clear as well that the CCP today wants a different relationship with the private sector than the party of yesterday.
As a result, I do not expect any significant loosening of policy in the next three to six months.
I could be wrong, of course. For sure, there will be a lot of pressure to loosen by year-end, especially if fourth-quarter economic data is well below expectations. If that’s the case, we will probably get some rate cuts and perhaps a turn to proactive fiscal policy in 2022.
But my base case is that these will not be big enough to turn growth around until at least the second half of 2022 and maybe later. Given that consensus market expectations are for an official GDP growth rate of 5% for 2022, I think there is a significant risk of a negative surprise.

229,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/inflation-transitory-troublesome.html,Inflation: Transitory or troublesome?,Inflation,"October 14, 2021","Of all the fears investors have faced over the past 30 years, high inflation wasn’t among them. In 2021, that’s changed.
Today, the biggest questions for investors revolve around inflation: How high will it go and how long will it last? Is it “transitory” as the Federal Reserve claims? Or is elevated inflation the new normal amid labor shortages, supply chain bottlenecks and a severe energy crunch?
The uncertain path of the pandemic makes near-term conditions difficult to predict but, over the long term, the picture comes into better focus, says Pramod Atluri, principal investment officer of The Bond Fund of America®.
“While we are facing a cyclical rise in inflation and interest rates today, when I look out five years, I think U.S. economic growth will be slower and inflation may be lower,” Atluri says. Economic growth should slow due to high debt levels and fading stimulus, resulting in a return to GDP gains of 1.5% to 2.5% a year. Consequently, interest rates should stay relatively low as well.
“In the meantime, we are laser focused on inflation because that’s the biggest risk to investors’ portfolios over the near term,” Atluri explains. “If we are wrong about inflation, we will be wrong on the upside, so it makes sense to protect against that outcome.”
A tale of two inflations: Sticky versus flexible
Sources: Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; Refinitive Datastream. Sticky and flexible prices reflect the Atlanta Federal Reserve sticky and flexible consumer price indexes (CPI). If price changes for a particular CPI component occur less than every 4.3 months, that component is a “sticky-price” good. Goods that change prices more frequently are “flexible-price” goods. As of August 2021.
Two flavors of inflation: Sticky and flexible
A source of uncertainty today is that there are two different types of inflation: sticky and flexible. Sticky inflation, currently around 2.6% annualized, tends to exhibit longer staying power. Sticky categories include rent, owners’ equivalent rent, insurance costs and medical expenses.
“When I look out five years, I think U.S. economic growth will be slower and inflation may be lower.”
Pramod Atluri 
Flexible inflation has climbed this year to nearly 14% — the highest since the 1970s. However, this level of inflation likely won’t last. The flexible category contains products such as food, energy and cars, where prices can move a lot higher or lower over time. For instance, that’s already happened with lumber, copper and soybeans. Prices for those products skyrocketed this spring and have since come down.
Price flare-ups in key commodities are starting to level out
Sources: Capital Group, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Refinitiv Datastream. Inflation is measured by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as of 8/31/21. Commodity prices are as of 9/30/21.
Beware of sticky inflation
As anyone who has tried to buy a used car knows, flexible inflation categories have spiked due to pandemic-related shortages, a lack of available labor and supply chain disruptions. A quick resolution to these challenges is unlikely, but more normal conditions should return by mid to late 2022, says Ritchie Tuazon, principal investment officer of American Funds Strategic Bond FundSM.
“What that means is, the upside risk is in the sticky components,” Tuazon explains. “Many of the flexible price categories moved higher for transitory reasons, but inflation in those areas may come back down to zero or even go negative. The sticky components will drive inflation in 2022 so that’s what investors need to keep an eye on.”
“I don’t think the Fed will be in a hurry to raise rates and potentially derail the COVID recovery if inflation remains in check.”
Ritchie Tuazon 
In short, flexible inflation is transitory, but sticky inflation could be troublesome.
In Tuazon’s estimation, overall inflation as measured by the U.S. Consumer Price Index should gradually decline in the months ahead, eventually falling into a range of 2.50% to 2.75% by the end of 2022.

WATCH
If that prediction holds, there’s a good chance the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates in 2022. Tuazon expects the Fed to officially announce in November that it will begin reducing its bond-buying stimulus program. That process will take several quarters. And the Fed’s first rate hike will come in 2023, which is later than market expectations.
“I don’t think the Fed will be in a hurry to raise rates and potentially derail the COVID recovery if inflation remains in check,” Tuazon reasons.
What if this benign inflation outlook is wrong and consumer prices move sharply higher?
“That is by no means our base case, but I think it is a big enough risk that it should factor into portfolio construction,” Tuazon adds. He favors Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, as an effective hedge against higher inflation.
Investment implications
Holding some TIPS in your bond portfolio is a smart move to consider heading into 2022, say both Tuazon and Atluri. As for stocks, there are a few rules of thumb to consider. Historically, higher prices have boosted commodities, as well as sectors that benefit from higher interest rates (such as banks) and companies with pricing power in must-have categories like semiconductors and popular consumer brands.
Before making portfolio adjustments, it’s important to remember that sustained periods of elevated inflation are rare in U.S. history. People of a certain age will remember the ultra-high inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s. But in hindsight, it’s clear that was a unique period. In fact, deflationary pressures have often been more difficult to tame, as students of the Great Depression will attest.
Over the past 100 years, U.S. inflation has stayed below 5% the vast majority of the time. More recently, in the aftermath of the 2007–2009 global financial crisis, inflation has struggled to hit 2% on a sustained basis. And that’s despite unprecedented stimulus measures engineered by the Fed in an attempt to reach the central bank’s 2% goal.
Another important point: It’s mostly at the extremes — when inflation is 6% or above — that financial assets tend to struggle. Stocks have also come under pressure when inflation goes negative, as one would expect.
For investors, some inflation can be a good thing. Even during times of higher inflation, stocks and bonds have generally provided solid returns as shown in the chart below.

On the legislative front, the range of potential outcomes remains broad. The big-ticket items at stake include a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill and a $3.5 trillion spending plan focused on health care, education, family support and climate change initiatives.
To help pay for these ambitious programs, a series of tax hikes are on the table, including an increase in the top marginal corporate tax rate, which would go from 21% to as high as 26.5%, according to a recent proposal in the House of Representatives. Higher corporate taxes will gain approval, in my view, although I think 25% is more likely to be the final number.
U.S. corporate taxes are likely heading higher
Sources: Capital Group, Strategas. As of 9/23/21.
Investors who may be worried about drastically higher taxes or runaway spending should keep one key factor in mind: The outcome will be shaped by centrist Democrats in the Senate. That means a big chunk of what’s creating headlines today will be seriously scaled back, in my opinion, as progressive goals meet the reality of the Democratic Party’s slender majorities in the House and Senate.
Here’s a brief look at three of the major issues taking center stage this week — and probably for the next several weeks — along with an assessment of the likely outcomes.

1. $3.5 trillion spending package will be cut roughly in half
While one could argue that $3.5 trillion in spending over 10 years isn’t all that much compared to the size of the U.S. economy, there simply isn’t enough support in Congress for such a large figure. After all is said and done, the top-line number in the budget reconciliation bill will probably slim down to $1.5 trillion or $2 trillion.
Revenue generated by proposed tax increases probably will amount to about $500 billion to $750 billion over the next decade, with most of the new tax burden falling on corporations. The rest will be deficit funded or wished away via fuzzy economic growth assumptions. Individual income tax hikes will account for a much smaller portion of the revenue pie and focus mostly on high earners. Those making more than $400,000 a year will probably see the top income tax rate rise to 39.6%, and the capital gains tax could climb to 25% or so. A 2% excise tax on stock buybacks is also in the mix and might be seen as a politically feasible way to raise needed revenue.
“The dilemma that Democrats face is how to fit $3.5 trillion worth of big ambitions into a smaller package.”
Over the next few weeks, the dilemma that Democrats face is how to fit $3.5 trillion worth of big ambitions into a smaller package. Major spending priorities will collide and there remains a chance, given complicated disputes within the Democratic Party, that the entire legislative agenda collapses. Coming up empty-handed would be a political disaster for Democrats as they head toward the 2022 midterm elections, but this scenario can’t be ruled out.
A pivotal first test of the endgame will come on Thursday, September 30, when the House is expected to vote on the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Some leaders in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party have argued that this bill should only pass in tandem with the broader reconciliation package. Otherwise, they feel they will lose leverage over the size and contours of the larger package. Other Democrats think it’s more important to bank a big “win” on infrastructure to create momentum for the rest of the legislative agenda.
2. Democrats will have to raise the debt ceiling on their own
Remember the debt ceiling standoffs of 2011 and 2013? They’re coming back with a vengeance. If the federal debt limit is not raised or suspended soon, the government could lose its legal authority to borrow money and perhaps fall for the first time ever into technical default. So far, Republican Party leaders are refusing to vote for an increase or suspension, and I don’t think they are bluffing. They relish the idea of forcing Democrats to authorize on their own a new debt level of $30 trillion or more. The GOP midterm attack ads write themselves.
Raise the roof: A debt ceiling standoff could get ugly
Sources: Capital Group, Refinitiv Datastream, U.S. Department of the Treasury, U.S. Office of Management and Budget. As of 8/31/21. Periods in which the statutory limit has been suspended are reflected by the shaded vertical bars, namely from February 2013–May 2013; October 2013–March 2015; November 2015–March 2017; September 2017–December 2017; January 2018–February 2019; and August 2019–July 2021.
The GOP view is that Democrats have the power, and thus the responsibility, to lift the debt ceiling with a simple majority vote in the Senate as part of the budget reconciliation process. My concern is that the political brinkmanship in the weeks ahead — against the backdrop of so many other high-stakes issues coming to a head — could lead to an “accident” in which the government falls into technical default, an event that would roil the markets and raise questions about U.S. political and financial stability.
Keep an eye on potential creative maneuvers Democrats may use at the eleventh hour, including invoking the Treasury’s obscure legal authority to mint trillion-dollar platinum coins and deposit them at the Federal Reserve to top up its checking account. (While this sounds odd, it is in fact considered a feasible option by some).
“The threat of a serious debt limit crisis isn’t trivial.”
This is a nonconsensus view, but I think the threat of a serious debt limit crisis isn’t trivial. I would put the odds at 10% to 15% if the issue isn’t resolved soon. One could argue that we shouldn’t have a debt limit in the first place. Only Denmark and Poland have such rules, and they don’t create U.S.-style crises. But the debt limit remains part of the U.S. political landscape and it isn’t going away anytime soon.
Meanwhile, the government’s funding is set to expire on Friday, October 1. If Congress takes no action, we could see another partial government shutdown. But I think Republicans will agree to extend the funding through early December, saving their ammo for a potentially dramatic debt ceiling showdown.
3. Midterm elections will produce a divided Congress
All these momentous events are happening against a backdrop of what could be one of the more consequential midterm elections in U.S. history. Make no mistake, every move in Washington right now is being carefully calculated with the midterms in mind. While the election is still more than a year away — and that’s a lifetime in politics — history suggests we will see a backlash against the party in power that will result in Republicans taking back control of the House and potentially the Senate.
Democrats are certainly worried about this outcome, which is why they feel the urgent need to pass their ambitious agenda now. Assuming history repeats itself, Republican control of the House or the Senate will end the affirmative phase of Joe Biden’s presidency and the Democratic Party’s lofty legislative ambitions.
Returns have been strongest under a split Congress
Sources: Capital Group, Strategas. As of 12/31/20. Unified government indicates White House, House and Senate are controlled by the same political party. Unified Congress indicates House and Senate are controlled by the same party, but the White House is controlled by a different party. Split Congress indicates House and Senate are controlled by different parties, regardless of White House control.
Whether you think that’s a good outcome or bad outcome, historically speaking, it appears to be the market’s favorite choice. From 1933 to 2020, under unified governments or a unified Congress, the average annual return for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index has fallen into a broad range from roughly 7% to 10%. When Congress is split, however, the average was 10.8%.
In my book, that’s a nice nonpartisan return.

231,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/will-pandemic-threaten-future-big-cities.html,Will the pandemic threaten the future of big cities?,Demographics & Culture,"September 16, 2021","You might think where you buy your coffee in the morning doesn’t amount to a hill of beans when it comes to the health of the U.S. economy. But, in fact, it could mean a great deal in the years ahead.
“Working remotely for the past year and a half, I’ve been buying coffee closer to home instead of my usual downtown coffee shop,” says Capital Group economist Jared Franz. “In my case, it doesn’t mean much, but if a quarter of the U.S. labor force does it one or two days a week, it has significant implications for the economy, financial markets and the future of large cities.”
While the data is short term and the jury is still out, there are early signs of a powerful deurbanization trend in the United States and other major developed economies. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, migration from some big cities has accelerated while suburban home prices have soared. Moreover, national labor force surveys indicate an overwhelming majority of employees who have been working from home want to continue doing so one or more days per week.
Moving out: 2020 urban exodus
Sources: U.S. Department of Commerce, Visa Business and Economic Insights. Net migration includes movers from abroad. As of December 31, 2020.
By 2022, Franz estimates, roughly 25% of U.S. employees could be working remotely — up from just 5% prior to the pandemic — and many of them will choose to live in less expensive, less crowded areas. Assuming this shift persists, it would be the biggest change in labor force patterns since World War II.
“From an investment perspective, we need to determine how durable these changes are, how they could affect consumer spending patterns and how companies may respond,” Franz explains. “For instance, what happens to that downtown coffee shop? Or the restaurants that serve the same area? Or the office space that is no longer needed?”
“I don’t think we are talking about the death of big cities, by any means,” Franz stresses. “But I do think we may have reached peak density for urban centers such as Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. They will have to adapt to a world where much of the labor force is no longer coming into an office every day. Twenty-five percent may not sound like much, but it’s a huge change from 5%.”
Many important questions remain unanswered: Will people flock back to big cities after the pandemic is over? Will they prefer life in the suburbs and other outlying areas? Or will both happen at the same time — perhaps with younger employees preferring to live in vibrant, dynamic cities and older workers continuing to fuel the growth of the suburbs and exurbs?
One crucial question appears to be resolved: People like working from home.
Want to work from home? Yes please!
Source: National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, “Why working from home will stick.” Based on surveys of 33,250 respondents conducted from May 2020 through March 2021. Results include all respondents who said they can work from home at least part of the time and those who reported mainly working from home at some point during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was 64% of the full sample.
Surveys by the National Bureau of Economic Research show that employees who are able to work from home definitely want to continue doing so. More than 77% said they would like to work remotely at least one day per week and 31% said they would prefer all five days. Not every job can be done remotely, of course, but 64% of respondents said their jobs are conducive to working from home at least part of the time.

It’s important to note that not everyone is on board with the work-from-home phenomenon. There has been a quiet backlash in recent months from certain companies pushing for more traditional work schedules, as well as the possibility of lowering the pay of employees who move from high-cost cities to lower cost areas. Companies don’t appear to be gaining much traction on those issues at the moment.
One large investment bank recently posed the question of whether we have reached the end of the honeymoon phase of remote work, citing concerns about employees’ isolation and mental health, the loss of company culture, the fate of downtown businesses and the growing threat of cyber attacks.
Sectors that benefit from deurbanization
Many sectors stand to benefit if the deurbanization trend endures, including personal travel and leisure, technology and communications, cloud computing, and the home improvement industry and residential real estate — particularly in the suburbs and other outlying areas.
Changes in consumer behavior mean these trends could be durable even as we head back to the office several days a week. For example, stores such as Home Depot and Lowe’s have clearly benefited from more people buying new and existing homes in the suburbs while the shift toward home fitness has boosted companies such as Peloton and Nike.
Exercise and outdoor activities are a potential bright spot, says Capital Group portfolio manager Lisa Thompson. “As an investment theme, I think it’s almost metaphoric. People are spending more time in nature, hiking or riding bikes, and they are realizing it’s actually very nice to be outdoors, to spend more time with family, to visit the national parks. I have friends who go camping now I never imagined would go camping.”
Sectors that suffer from deurbanization
On the flip side, commercial real estate stands out as one of the hardest hit sectors, and the outlook remains challenging to say the least. Office vacancy rates nationally rose above 17% in the second quarter of 2021, up from roughly 13% in the first quarter of 2020 before government-imposed lockdowns brought the economy to a virtual standstill.
Commercial real estate has been hit hard
Source: Cushman & Wakefield. As of June 30, 2021.
Commercial real estate loans, meanwhile, have not experienced the type of distress or outright defaults that investors might expect, largely due to government stimulus programs that helped small and mid-size companies meet their lease and payroll obligations. “We’re in a holding pattern right now because government support has been so strong,” Franz notes, “but as we move into 2022, I think that could change materially for the worse.”
Within the wider real estate industry there has been a large disparity between subsectors that have been hammered — office, retail and hotel, for instance — and others that have rallied as the economy and stock markets recovered from the downturn. Those include storage, industrial and residential categories.
A tale of two real estate markets

In states with large urban centers, state and local government finances could also be impacted, Thompson adds.
“Deurbanization puts a lot of pressure on states like New York and California that have relied on a very high tax base of wealthy people in Manhattan, Los Angeles and San Francisco,” Thompson notes. “It could wind up being a big challenge for states that have benefited enormously from the mega-city concept.”
Echoing Franz’s sentiment, however, Thompson says she expects large urban centers to adapt and eventually thrive in a post-COVID environment. Big cities are resilient, she says, and they have a long history of recovering from difficult times.
“I can remember when big cities were not places that people wanted to go in the 1970s and 1980s,” Thompson recalls. “Today, older people may say, ‘I don’t need to be in the city anymore,’ but I think younger people will still want to be at the center of civic life and entertainment. Cities will just reinvent themselves again.”

233,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/top-5-investment-worries-answered.html,Answers to your 5 biggest investment concerns,Markets & Economy,"July 21, 2021","Markets have been climbing a wall of worry in 2021, reaching record highs even as investors brace for the possibility of elevated inflation, rising interest rates, runaway debt and a bitcoin bubble. With so much to trouble investors, many are wondering how these uncertain times will affect their portfolios.
That’s what we found when we polled more than 5,000 financial professionals during recent Capital Ideas webinars to identify their top questions and concerns. Here are our investment team’s answers to the five most frequently asked questions of 2021:
1. Will inflation and rising rates affect my portfolio?
We received more questions about rising rates and inflation than any other topic. And that was before the Consumer Price Index accelerated 5.0% in May and 5.4% in June — the two highest year-over-year growth rates since 2008.
The thinking goes like this: A powerful economic recovery fueled by massive stimulus measures will lead to runaway inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise rates quicker than expected, which would slow economic growth and be a significant headwind to investors.
U.S. economist Darrell Spence doesn’t expect current levels of inflation to be sustainable over the long term, as they are still being driven by significant price increases in a small number of categories. “That said, a clear risk to this scenario is that a resurgence of the virus causes portions of the economy to shut down again and policymakers to unleash another round of stimulus,” notes Spence. “This will simply prolong the imbalance between stimulus-induced demand and COVID-restricted supply, and likely cause inflation to remain more persistent.”
Inflation has jumped but labor data suggests it may be temporary
Sources: Bloomberg, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Federal Reserve. Data as of 6/30/21. Goals for the inflation and employment measures are estimated targets needed to meet the Federal Reserve’s stated dual mandate of achieving price stability and maximum sustainable employment. Goals for inflation are directly from the Fed. Goals for employment are estimates from Capital Group. Pre-pandemic peak considers the trailing 12 months prior to February 2020. Inflation shown based on the Consumer Price Index, with core excluding energy and food. Under-employment rate consists of total unemployed, plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force, plus total employed part time for economic reasons.
Likewise, the Capital Group rates team does not believe we have shifted to a new era of high long-term inflation, although it may remain elevated for longer than some initially expected. “While we should continue to see inflation volatility, I expect it to subside by the end of next year,” says Ritchie Tuazon, a portfolio manager for American Funds Inflation Linked Bond Fund®.
Market jitters over these short-term inflationary pressures have hastened expectations for a rate hike to 2022. “That’s far earlier than anticipated given the Fed’s stated desire to let inflation run hot and get the U.S. economy back to full employment,” says portfolio manager Pramod Atluri.
In recent years, the Fed has made it a priority to take their time and signal moves well in advance. So before the next rate increase, the Fed is likely to take several distinct steps to facilitate the tapering of its bond-buying activities and communicate an imminent hike.
Bottom line: Inflation will likely remain elevated through the end of next year but then should moderate back to the Fed’s 2% long-term target. Higher volatility is likely as surprises in inflation data could trigger market turbulence in the near term. Our rates team believes the Fed’s first interest rate hike is at least 12–18 months away.
2. Is surging U.S. debt sustainable?
U.S. government debt has been mounting, and current policy proposals suggest there is no end in sight. The passage of a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package in March helped drive the trailing 12-month federal deficit to 18.6% of gross domestic product — the largest shortfall since 1945. This will almost certainly push Uncle Sam’s public debt above its World War II-era peak of 106% of GDP.
U.S. debt is projected to reach new heights
Source: Congressional Budget Office as of March 4, 2021. Federal debt held by the public. Long-term forecast excludes the impact of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and assumes no meaningful changes to current laws affecting U.S. government revenues and spending.
So with debt nearing unprecedented levels, is it time for investors to worry? Opinions vary, but here are four reasons U.S. debt may not spiral out of control:
Interest rates are lower than GDP growth
The U.S. debt position is worsening but is not an outlier
Governments have various levers to pull
Monetary policy can adapt to changing conditions
Between the perpetually low interest rate environment and a multitude of government response measures available, current debt levels should be sustainable for now. Typically, a debt crisis arises when investors are no longer willing to purchase a country’s debt, and that seems unlikely to happen in the U.S. anytime soon.
Bottom line: Although U.S. debt may act as a headwind to long-term growth, it is unlikely to cause a crisis as long as interest rates are lower than GDP growth and the U.S. dollar remains the world’s reserve currency. Even if debt eventually becomes an issue, it could be decades before markets feel an impact.
3. Should I shift from growth to value stocks?
The growth-value decision doesn’t have to be an either-or proposition, says veteran equity portfolio manager Martin Romo. As a portfolio manager on The Growth Fund of America®, it would be fitting for Romo to lean toward growth stocks. But that’s not how he thinks about investing.
“There can be growing companies that are cheap and cheap companies that grow, so value and growth are not in opposition,” Romo noted in a recent interview. “We are in a target-rich environment, and there are opportunities to invest in fast-growing companies as well as classic cyclical companies.""
Value stocks got a booster shot in November 2020 when the first COVID-19 vaccine was found to be highly effective. Since then, industries that suffered the most during the pandemic such as energy, financials and real estate have enjoyed massive rebounds. However, the two worst performing sectors in 2021 through June 30 — utilities and consumer staples — are also traditionally value sectors.
November 9 was a turning point for many cyclical companies
Sources: FactSet, Standard & Poor’s. All data represent total returns for industries within the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index and are in USD. 11/6/20 was the last business day before the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine candidate was revealed to have more than 90% efficacy against COVID-19 in global trials.
Bottom line: It’s important to balance individual investment opportunities rather than make decisions based on a binary label like growth or value. And as markets continue to reach new records and frothy valuations increasingly become a concern, company-by-company analysis will likely become even more essential.
4. Is Big Tech in big trouble?
Government efforts to rein in Big Tech have been underway for years, but 2021 could be a watershed moment. Political, societal and market-based forces are combining to put these companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and others — under the microscope. It’s an important issue for investors, as these stocks enjoyed dazzling returns over the last decade. They are among the largest in the world and may represent outsized positions in many portfolios.

Assessing the regulatory risks of large tech companies is a complex task, given that they operate in different industries with vastly different competitive profiles — everything from retail to advertising to television.
The antitrust cases against Google and Facebook don’t appear to be strong and likely won’t result in any forced breakups, according to Brad Barrett, an analyst who covers ad supported internet companies. Notably, many of the products provided by these goliaths are free, diminishing traditional antitrust arguments that rely on pricing power to help determine monopoly status. And in the unlikely event that one or more of these companies is forced to break up, a reasonable argument could be made that some of the spinoffs may be worth more on their own.
In addition to antitrust issues, legislation over content monitoring and privacy and data protections are also on the table. But according to internet analyst Tracy Li such regulations may have surprising consequences for the industry. “I believe that concerns related to privacy or content may actually strengthen, rather than weaken, the moats of the largest platforms,” says Li. “These companies often boast well-established protocols and deep resources pertaining to privacy and legal matters.""
Bottom line: Regulatory pressures may continue to hang over Big Tech stocks for years, but current valuations already reflect much of this risk. An outright breakup of companies seems improbable, and even in that unlikely scenario a spinoff of certain assets could unlock additional shareholder value.
5. My client wants to invest in Bitcoin. What should I tell them?
Fear of missing out is a powerful force in investing. And it’s difficult to ignore an asset that has gained more than 500,000% in just a few years, eliciting headline-grabbing commentary from Elon Musk and Warren Buffett, among others.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have captured the imagination of investors, putting financial professionals, plan sponsors and consultants at the center of an increasingly frenetic discussion about whether to jump into the fray or steer clear.
“If you have a client who really wants to buy Bitcoin, just saying ‘don’t do it’ is a disservice,” says Barbara Burtin, an equity investment analyst who covers the banking industry. “In fact, owning a small amount can be a learning experience — for you and the client.”
In a recent article, How to talk to clients about Bitcoin, Burtin suggested investors dedicate no more than 1% of their portfolio to any cryptocurrency. Such a limit may have seemed overly conservative because Bitcoin’s price had done nothing but skyrocket for months. But the fastest growing assets often fall just as quickly and, given Bitcoin’s speculative nature, the suggestion had merit. Since then, Bitcoin prices have declined nearly 40%.
“If a client insists, ‘I must put money into this,’ advise them to invest no more than they can afford to lose,” Burtin cautioned.
Bitcoin has had periods of spectacular gains — and losses
Sources: Google Trends, Refinitiv Datastream. As of 7/14/21. Prices are shown on a logarithmic scale and expressed in U.S. dollars. Search volume data represent Google search volume relative to the highest point for the given time period. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular as the peak.
Bottom line: It may be tempting to dismiss Bitcoin as a fad and tell clients it’s inappropriate for their portfolios, but simply discounting it won’t be an adequate answer for some. There are certainly risks associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but there are also groundbreaking innovations and potential for the future of the technology. Whether looking at cryptocurrencies for your clients or your own portfolio, discipline and proper expectations are key.

It’s a question many are asking. U.S. government debt is on a sharp upward trend, and current policy proposals suggest that will continue. The recent passage of a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package has helped drive the trailing 12-month federal deficit to 18.6% of gross domestic product — the largest shortfall since 1945. This will almost certainly push Uncle Sam’s public debt above the World War II-era peak of 106% of GDP.
A rising tide of debt: U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio
Source: Congressional Budget Office as of March 4, 2021. Federal debt held by the public. Long-term forecast excludes the impact of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and assumes no meaningful changes to current laws affecting U.S. government revenues and spending.
While we are moving into uncharted territory, there are many factors that can influence whether — or when — this debt will ever become a real problem. Here are four reasons why we believe the federal debt should be manageable for the foreseeable future.
1. Interest rates are lower than GDP growth
Many economists believe that debt crises arise when the debt-to-GDP ratio crosses 100%. Above that level, the debt stock can begin to spiral upward by itself, even without further additions from ongoing deficits. Italy and Greece are the most recent examples of this phenomenon. U.S. debt is currently crossing this threshold.
However, this debt-spiral math only works if a country’s interest rate is higher than its growth rate. As long as the nominal interest rate on the debt is less than the nominal growth rate of the economy, the upward spiral can be avoided. That is the situation in the U.S. today, and it is likely to remain the case for the foreseeable future.
Nominal interest rates have been lower than the nominal growth rate for most of the time since the early 1960s. However, this relationship has fluctuated. During the 1960s, nominal growth regularly exceeded the interest rate on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds, but that flipped during the 1980s and into the 1990s as inflationary pressures drove interest rates sharply higher.
In the 2000s, the relationship reverted to its more sustainable form, although at lower levels of nominal growth and higher levels of government debt relative to GDP. Looking ahead, this suggests that the biggest risk could be a sustained surge of inflation that drives interest rates well above the GDP growth rate.
Sustaining the U.S. debt: GDP growth vs. interest rates
Sources: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Federal Reserve, Refinitiv Datastream. As of March 31, 2021. Chart displays the difference in percentage points between the year-over-year growth rate of nominal GDP and the nominal 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on a quarterly basis since the first quarter of 1962. 
Notably, while a 100% debt-to-GDP ratio has proven to be a trigger point in some past debt crises, there are exceptions to this rule. Japan is the most prominent example. It has benefited from the fact that a large part of its debt is held by a somewhat captive domestic investor base that includes large banks, pension funds, the post office and other institutional investors.

2. The U.S. fiscal position is worsening but is not an outlier
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated rising debt trends around the world, not just in the U.S. Many countries took aggressive fiscal and monetary policy actions to soften the economic impact of widespread lockdowns last year.
The U.S.’s debt-to-GDP ratio has risen sharply since just before the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, but it still trails Japan’s by a wide margin. The U.S. debt burden is not far ahead of those of the U.K. and the eurozone. China and other emerging markets have lower ratios but have also seen significant increases. 
Debt rising around the world: Gross government debt to GDP
Source: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Database, April 2021.
While the U.S. debt burden has risen sharply on an absolute basis, the increase has been less substantial on a relative basis. From the perspective of sovereign debt investors, that means the U.S. is not a significant outlier in terms of debt sustainability. That reflects the global nature of the rising debt-to-GDP trend. Government debt worldwide reached $82.3 trillion, or 105% of GDP, in 2020 ― up from 88% in 2019, the Institute of International Finance reported in February. In mature markets, it reached 130% of GDP in 2020, up from 110% in 2019.
America’s relative position is also enhanced by the privileged status of the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency, which creates a significant level of built-in demand for U.S. Treasury debt and other dollar-denominated assets. The U.S. Treasury market enjoys safe-haven status in periods of market stress, owing to a perceived low risk of default. Many assets, including most commodities, are priced in dollar terms and U.S. Treasuries remain the “risk-free” asset against which most other assets are priced. These attributes support demand for U.S. government bonds, which in turn helps support the debt burden.
3. Governments have various levers to pull
That said, the higher the debt burden, the greater the potential for it to cause a problem. The textbook solution for a country running large deficits and a rising debt burden is to raise taxes, cut spending or both. While such measures may weigh on economic growth in the short run, paying down debt could help offset that in the longer term. The lesson from the post‒WWII experience is that the process of debt reduction can take decades.
In the near term, while individual and corporate tax rates may go up modestly, government spending is likely to increase as well. This does not necessarily have to be negative for the deficit, however. To the extent that the U.S. economy sees higher levels of productivity and innovation as a result, it could boost growth, and thus tax revenues. This is not all that difficult to imagine in an era of rapid technological change. There may even be innovations coming out of the pandemic that lead to improved productivity and growth, making the debt burden more manageable. 
U.S. government budget deficit widens
Sources: U.S. Treasury Department and Bureau of Economic Analysis. As of March 31, 2021.
One alternative economic theory that has received some attention amid the surge in U.S. debt is Modern Monetary Theory. MMT posits that most countries that issue their own currency face no financial constraints. Thus, for many governments — including the U.S. — there is no risk of default. Governments can decide what they need to spend as their first priority, and then address financing through taxation and borrowing. There are limits to debt levels, but those levels are tied to inflation.
As noted by economist and MMT advocate Stephanie Kelton, inflation is evidence that a deficit is too big, while unemployment is evidence of a deficit that is too small. Thus, under MMT, fiscal policy plays a more central role in the management of inflation. Critics note that, among other things, the management of inflation would be more heavily influenced by the political process under MMT. In addition, the Federal Reserve would lose its independence, and the framework that has anchored inflation expectations for arguably the last 30 years would be gone.
4. Monetary policy can adapt to changing conditions
Finally, there is the Federal Reserve. While the goals and policies of the central bank have evolved since its founding over 100 years ago, the current monetary policy framework has shifted to an explicit inflation target and maximizing employment. The Fed’s recent move toward average inflation targeting, plus its signals that low policy rates and asset purchases will remain in place, support higher nominal GDP growth and low interest rates, a dynamic that makes the level of federal debt more tenable.
The global financial crisis was the first time that many people had ever heard of the Fed using its balance sheet to support large asset purchases. But the practice of buying U.S. government securities as an instrument of monetary policy dates to the 1920s. Following World War I, Benjamin Strong, then head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, did so in an effort to stem a recession in 1923.
A few years later, the country entered the Great Depression and, just as in the late 2000s, short-term interest rates quickly hit the zero lower bound in the early 1930s. During World War II, the U.S. Treasury directed the Federal Reserve to target short- and long-term interest rates through the purchase of U.S. government bonds as a means of financing the war effort.
Fast forward to Ben Bernanke, who became Fed chair in 2006. His legacy is defined by the Fed’s actions to stabilize the financial system and the economy during the financial crisis. Having reached the zero bound on policy rates, the Federal Reserve purchased billions of dollars of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. This quantitative easing may have been new to many market participants, but it was already part of the Fed’s playbook.
There is no reason to think that U.S. monetary policy will stop adapting to the changing circumstances of the U.S. and global economies. As a result, it is useful to keep an open mind regarding potential approaches and regime shifts. For instance, a large balance sheet at the Federal Reserve could become a fixture for many years to come. This should not be underestimated as a policy tool with the capacity to absorb sizable government debt issuance.
Bottom line: The outlook is not so dire
The response by the federal government to the COVID-19 pandemic has taken us back to levels of debt not seen since World War II. While the level of government debt is high, it is elevated in other mature economies as well.
The fact is that a debt crisis arises when investors are no longer willing to purchase a country’s debt. When that will occur is very difficult to predict, although it does not seem likely to happen in the U.S. anytime soon. Traditional analysis suggests that debt levels are sustainable as long as the cost of debt remains below the level of economic growth, but there are still likely limits. What they are, however, is unclear.
Markets can act as a signaling tool in this process, which in turn can influence political choices and the role played by the Federal Reserve. The economy can also change, with technology and new behavior driving innovation and improved productivity. Suffice to say that there are many forces that can influence the path of debt, and the federal response to it, going forward.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have captured the imagination of investors, putting financial professionals, plan sponsors and consultants at the center of an increasingly frenetic discussion about whether to jump into the fray or steer clear.
Sure, it may be tempting to dismiss Bitcoin as a passing fad and tell clients it’s inappropriate for their portfolios. But simply discounting it won’t be an adequate answer for some. Moreover, the question itself presents an important opportunity for you to better understand your clients’ risk tolerance.
“If you have a client who really wants to buy Bitcoin, just saying ‘don’t do it’ is a disservice,” says Barbara Burtin, an equity investment analyst at Capital Group who covers the banking industry. “In fact, owning a small amount can be a learning experience — for you and the client.”
Bitcoin’s remarkable rise — in price and search activity
Sources: Google Trends, Refinitiv Datastream. As of 5/6/21. Search volume data represents Google search volume relative to the highest point for the given time period. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular as the peak. Bitcoin prices are shown on a logarithmic scale and expressed in U.S. dollars.
What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is by far the most popular variation among a class of assets designed to create a digital currency through advanced cryptography. Other popular cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin operates without central authority or banks and is not backed by any government.
Bitcoin traces its roots to 2008, when an anonymous programmer operating under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published a white paper outlining the technology and code needed to enable the cryptocurrency.
Most important, the paper described the process of “mining,” which creates a supply of new bitcoins. Bitcoins are mined using computer algorithms that solve a series of calculations. These time-consuming computations verify bitcoins and allow for the creation of new ones. Only 21 million bitcoins can be mined, and they become more time consuming to create as the supply grows.

Volatility in action
“Bitcoin tends to garner a lot of attention every time it has one of these steep run-ups in value,” explains Capital Group portfolio manager Alan Wilson. “But keep in mind, at some point it may go in the other direction, too. Anyone speculating should be prepared for extreme volatility in either direction.”
In fact, Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline on April 17, falling nearly 14% in an hour before rebounding. The temporary plunge appears to have been triggered by unconfirmed internet rumors that U.S. authorities were planning to crack down on money laundering involving cryptocurrencies. A few days earlier, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rose as the trading platform Coinbase went public, attracting an $86 billion valuation. 
Tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk have also famously contributed to Bitcoin's price volatility. For instance, his initial pledge in February to accept Bitcoin as payment for Tesla vehicles sent the cryptocurrency soaring. Then his reversal of that pledge in May triggered a slide. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a statement on May 11 calling attention to mutual funds with exposure to the Bitcoin futures market, noting that investors should “focus on the level of risk they are taking on” and whether they are comfortable with that risk.
How Bitcoin is mined

With Bitcoin basics out of the way, what are the key issues to consider when discussing cryptocurrencies with clients? Several Capital Group professionals who’ve studied cryptocurrencies offered these four ideas:
1. Suggest limits, and treat it as a learning experience
It’s easy for investors to extrapolate how $100,000 invested in Bitcoin five years ago would be worth over $14 million today. But it’s your responsibility to explain that such spectacular past results are not predictive of future performance.
Given Bitcoin’s extreme volatility, you might tell clients who are convinced they must own it to dedicate no more than 1% of their portfolio to any cryptocurrency, Burtin suggests. “If a client insists, ‘I must put money into this,’ advise them to invest no more than they can afford to lose,” she adds.
In addition, owning a small amount of cryptocurrency could be useful as an educational exercise, Burtin notes. Having “skin in the game” is a way to encourage clients to learn about cryptocurrency. It’s also a way to assess their true risk tolerance and observe reactions to high levels of market volatility.
2. Explain the significant risks
Some clients might reconsider the idea of buying Bitcoin once they learn its limitations, says Douglas Upton, an equity investment analyst at Capital Group who covers metals and mining. 
Risk 1: Bitcoin is impractical as a means of exchange from a resources standpoint. Bitcoin supply is limited, and new bitcoin can only be “mined” using high-powered computer systems that crunch algorithms. The process requires so much computing power that cryptocurrency mining consumes roughly 0.6% of the world’s electricity — more than that used by the entire nation of Argentina, according to the Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index maintained by Cambridge University’s Centre for Alternative Finance. As the price soars, it becomes more profitable for speculators to install high-powered computers for mining operations. If it rises further, then so will electricity consumption, much of it in places where electricity is coal-based and therefore generates significant CO2 emissions, says Upton.
Risk 2: Governments are unlikely to allow bitcoin usage to flourish without controls, Upton says. “Bitcoin seeks to replace sovereign currencies,” he notes. “If allowed to proliferate, it could reduce the ability of governments and central banks to set monetary policy, and to tax earnings and wealth.” Accordingly, lawmakers around the world could decide to make the use of Bitcoin more difficult. South Korea recently introduced legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies to curb potential money laundering and other illegal activities. China, which has cracked down on cryptocurrencies in the past, just introduced its own digital currency, and the U.S. may someday follow suit with a “digital dollar.” 
Risk 3: Bitcoin is not a store of stable value. Some investors may be drawn to cryptocurrencies thinking they’re an asset to store value, but there have been several cases of bitcoin theft. Some unfortunate owners have lost access to their funds by misplacing or forgetting their private digital keys. Since Bitcoin isn’t controlled by any central authority, there’s no one to contact for assistance.
Risk 4: Negative carry. Investors are normally paid to hold most major currencies, including the U.S. dollar, in the form of interest, Upton notes. That’s not the case with Bitcoin as investors who hold the asset may lose out on earned interest. The same is true of gold. This is called a negative carry, meaning investors can lose money simply holding the asset.
Risk 5: Bitcoin is not always a hedge against U.S. equity risk, says Capital Group currency analyst Jens Sondergaard. A common assertion of Bitcoin enthusiasts is that it may help provide downside protection when equity markets decline. While that has been the case at times, Bitcoin did not act as an effective hedge during the bear market in late February and March 2020. The price fell sharply, followed by a rebound and then a huge run-up. “It remains an open question whether Bitcoin can act as a hedge,” Sondergaard says. “Investors should be careful assuming too much about how it will behave in various market environments.”
Bitcoin's correlation to U.S. equity markets spiked in 2020
Source: Refinitiv Datastream. As of 4/15/21. Data represents correlation over a rolling six-month period, using daily returns. Correlation indicates the tendency of two assets to move in the same direction. In portfolio construction, lower or negative correlation between two assets means that the assets have tended to move in opposite directions, which can help reduce portfolio volatility.
3. Acknowledge the potential of the underlying technology
While there are certainly big risks associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, there are also groundbreaking innovations, says Ninou Sarwono, a Capital Group emerging technologies specialist.
Innovation 1: Blockchain. Think of Bitcoin as the first application of blockchain, the underlying technology that powers digital ledgers that can be shared over public or private networks and tracks transactions. These ledgers are created from transactions, approved by network participants and recorded as blocks of information. As more blocks of transactions pile up, they are securely chained to older transactions. These chains of data can be shared and added onto by trading partners, providing an easier and more efficient way to handle financial transactions.
Bitcoin’s underlying technology is already used by many large financial institutions. No matter the fate of Bitcoin, blockchain’s future looks very promising, Sarwono says.
Innovation 2: Initial coin offerings (ICOs). ICOs are a way for companies to raise money for their operations using cryptocurrency. The proceeds fund new projects while the buyers receive “tokens” that in many cases can be traded or used to buy goods and services from the issuing company. Tokens are akin to rewards points like frequent flier miles, Sarwono explains.
Such innovations could change the way companies raise money and widen the pool of companies available for investment. But again, the possibility has pitfalls. Government regulators have warned that ICOs are not registered and, therefore, are easy targets for fraud. Indeed, there have been quite a few problems associated with these vehicles.
Innovation 3: New alternatives for some parts of the world. The attractiveness of cryptocurrency tends to be greater in countries with less stable currencies, Burtin says. Like gold, cryptocurrencies may be seen as a way to store value. Additional regulation could be a good thing in preserving the benefits of cryptocurrencies while controlling the negatives.
4. Consider using Bitcoin to better understand investor psychology
Although it may seem prudent for advisors to discourage any attempt by clients to buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, there are valid reasons to explore the options. The best of which may just come down to investor psychology.
If a client buys Bitcoin, you can gauge their reaction to high levels of market volatility. This is a valuable, realistic way to understand true risk tolerance beyond what’s captured in a standard client survey, Burtin explains. That insight into a client’s psychology could be useful when crafting an asset allocation plan for their portfolio.
“Behavior is so important when investing,” she says. “It’s more than Bitcoin. It’s a social experiment.”

237,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/mergers-acquisitions-5-questions-answered.html,The coming M&A wave: 5 key questions answered,Markets & Economy,"March 10, 2021","Will M&A play a significant role in the post-pandemic world? Companies often rely on mergers & acquisitions to transform their businesses by buying, selling or divesting assets, and 2021 is shaping up to be a big year for deal making.
M&A activity hit $484.5 billion for January and February, up 33% compared to last year.
“Watching companies get acquired or become acquirers is one of my favorite aspects of small-cap investing,” says Greg Wendt, co-president of SMALLCAP World Fund®. “It’s fascinating to track small companies and see which ones make it to a much bigger scale.”
M&A is not just a big deal in small cap. It can impact companies across equity and bond markets. With that in mind, Wendt and a few other Capital Group portfolio managers shared their views on 5 key questions about the M&A boom:
1. What’s fueling the rise of M&A? 
“Companies have come out of the shell shock of the first half of 2020 and are now more confident about the future,” Wendt says. Many have strong balance sheets and consider M&A as a growth strategy.
Companies are also sitting on record amounts of cash, says Scott Sykes, a fixed income portfolio manager with American Funds Multi-Sector Income Fund℠.  Some industries such as cruise lines and hotel chains raised money to stay afloat through the pandemic. Others — after an initial dash for cash in case of a prolonged downturn — raised additional funds to take advantage of low interest rates.
Many investors expect companies to buy back stock and debt, put funds toward acquisitions, or do a combination of all three, Sykes notes.

2. Are sky-high equity valuations influencing deals?
“CEOs are a little amazed at their stock prices. They want to use that advantage strategically, and many want to make acquisitions,” Wendt says. “We are in a buoyant market with high stock prices that companies can use as currency.”
Companies that engage in M&A are often those with a history and pattern of deal making. “There are companies you know that make sense as part of bigger companies. And every now and then you’re surprised when the acquirer gets acquired,” Wendt adds.
Meanwhile, companies with more leverage, such as those in the high-yield sector, could use this opportunity to go public, according to David Daigle, lead portfolio manager for American High-Income Trust®. “Private equity firms will be minor players when it comes to buying public assets at these valuations,” Daigle adds. “They will, however, bid aggressively for carve out assets that come up for sale as companies seek to reposition their businesses. But paying a 30% premium on top of already high public valuations is not something you’ll see very often.”
Valuations across most industries are high

3. Is M&A good for investors?
While companies often tout value creation as a result of M&A, many end up destroying value, Wendt says. The Harvard Business Review recently warned management that the “once-in-a-generation opportunity to make acquisitions” could lead to deals that ultimately hurt companies.
“I’m not a huge fan of transformative acquisitions — I’ve seen too many that didn’t work,” Wendt says. “Often M&A is a product of a company running out of gas. They fail as often as they succeed.”
“I think big picture, M&A is a key risk to credit,” Sykes adds. “Large deals tend to add leverage and increase risks. M&A is something I am tracking, and I actively avoid or reduce investments in companies I think could lever up dramatically.”
But the right management team can make all the difference. “Many executives love their companies, and it says a lot about their commitment to maximizing shareholder value when they are willing to sell,” says Wendt. “One of my favorite examples is an airline that sold itself at a time when it was doing very well. The CEO said he just did not see a path to becoming a long-term winner in a consolidating industry.”
On the flip side, there have been companies that turned down incredible offers only to languish for decades trying to get back to that higher price.

4. What industries could be most transformed by M&A?
Digitization across all industries will drive many M&A deals. The pandemic accelerated the growth of many tech companies, particularly Big Tech. Although Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet may refrain from acquisitions in the face of intense regulatory scrutiny, there are several smaller tech companies that could become targets or buyers, according to Wendt.
For example, banks have always wanted a slice of the digital payment space, but the pandemic accelerated the move toward contactless payments. Large players such as PayPal continue to make acquisitions but may eventually find themselves a target.
Gaming companies such as casino operators are also on the hunt for digital offerings in the areas of fantasy sports and online betting. “This industry is maturing quickly, and it is much easier to get a known customer to bet more than to identify new customers,” Wendt adds.
Media is also another sector undergoing massive shifts, with cord cutting continuing to drive some of the changes. “There’s a lot more competition creating content, and it’s unclear if some of the programming translates well to streaming,” Sykes notes. “Will Amazon, Netflix, or Disney+ buy content the same way that CBS and ABC once did?”
Meanwhile, Big Pharma’s penchant for acquiring smaller companies with drugs nearing regulatory approval is well-known. This year will be no exception, he adds.
Innovation is particularly fragmented in drug development with many small players working to find solutions to big health care problems. Regulatory pressure to keep costs low and preserve patent expirations on key drugs tend to support M&A activity no matter the economic environment.
In energy, companies may engage in M&A to create a better industry structure that allows them to be profitable, Daigle says. Many are investing in renewables as governments worldwide call for lower emissions, and legacy energy companies are seeking to consolidate amid persistently low energy prices.
5. How are SPACs changing the game?
The frenzy around special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) has achieved star status. Shaquille O’Neal and Alex Rodriguez are among the names providing the funding. Even major corporations such as consumer food company Post Holdings and device maker Medtronic are in on the act.
A SPAC allows a private company to become public without going through the lengthy process of filing an initial public offering, or IPO. Here’s how it works: The publicly traded SPAC raises cash via the market and uses the funds to acquire a private company. By comparison, an IPO is when a company files paperwork to raise funds as part of its effort to go public.
More than 380 SPACs raised $106 billion last year. And in January 2021 alone, SPACs raised roughly $32 billion.
SPACs are on the rise
Source: Bloomberg. Includes all announced deals as of 2/18/2021.
The sheer number of active SPACs created in 2020 indicates the pipeline for acquisitions is exceptionally high.
“M&A is going to be really interesting this year because of the rise of SPACs, which generally have two years to find a deal or the money gets returned,” says Wendt, who has already invested in several SPACs. “There are going to be lots of new companies introduced to the market, which is great for an organization with deep research capabilities.”

Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. Small-company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds.
Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness. If agency ratings differ, the security will be considered to have received the highest of those ratings, consistent with the fund's investment policies. Securities in the unrated category have not been rated by a rating agency; however, the investment adviser performs its own credit analysis and assigns comparable ratings that are used for compliance with fund investment policies.

238,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/pent-up-demand.html,Roaring ‘20s: How pent-up demand could fuel recovery,U.S. Equities,"February 4, 2021","With major league baseball’s spring training just around the corner, you may already be daydreaming about the smell of cut grass and roasted peanuts, hearing the crack of the bat and the roar of the crowd — just to feel normal again.
If so, you are not alone — not among fellow Americans weary of the COVID pandemic nor within the context of history. This would not be the first time Americans have lived through a period of austerity brought on by a pandemic that resulted in burgeoning pent-up demand. In 1918, the Spanish Flu and World War I largely curtailed social gatherings and other activities across the country. 
To be sure, the U.S. was a very different place in the early 20th century, but consider that attendance at baseball stadiums in 1918 was half that of the previous year.
By 1919, however, the pandemic had largely subsided, the war was over and attendance at games soared from 2.8 million in 1918 to 6.5 million in 1919. The decade that followed — the Roaring ‘20s — coincided with the first golden age of the automobile. Americans eager to see the countryside bought nearly 26 million cars and 3 million trucks in the 1920s, according to Automotive News.
Could pent-up demand for travel and leisure drive a Roaring ‘20s today? 
“I think the quick introduction of vaccines is a major game changer, even with all the growing pains we are seeing in terms of distribution,” says equity portfolio manager Lisa Thompson. “A travel recovery is coming, and I think it can happen relatively quickly. Everybody is eager to go on vacation or to just get out and do stuff. The question is whether the recovery has legs. I think we will have to see how the vaccine rollout evolves, among other things.”
Ready, willing — and able — to spend
Indeed, cabin fever appears to have taken hold of consumers everywhere. There are signs that Americans are prepared to act: Savings rates have soared since the start of the pandemic, and though they have slowed a bit in recent months they remain relatively high.
Many consumers have boosted their savings during the pandemic
“Once there’s an all-clear, I expect the desire to travel plus the ability for many consumers to spend means we could see a powerful recovery, even if it takes a few years,” adds Thompson, who has spent more than 30 years as a professional investor.
“This crisis is much different than the global financial crisis in 2008 or any of the other crises I’ve seen in my career. Today, looser fiscal policy, looser monetary policy, a very strong banking system and high personal savings rates could help drive a very sharp pickup in demand.”
These conditions not only can benefit the travel and leisure industries but also the broader economy. To be sure, there will probably be hiccups along the way, and some areas will likely recover more quickly than others.

Passenger loyalty: A tailwind for cruise lines
Cruise ships became the epicenter of the COVID crisis in February 2020, when 3,700 people were quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess after a shipboard outbreak. At the time, the ship accounted for half of all known cases outside mainland China.
“This industry has gotten so much negative media, yet people are still booking cruises for 2021 and 2022 at prices higher than they were in 2019,” says equity analyst Todd Saligman, who covers cruise lines and U.S. and European airlines. “That’s pretty indicative of the demand. There is a loyalty and enthusiasm among cruisers that people who don’t cruise may fail to appreciate, and that loyalty has persisted through the crisis.”
In fact, more than 70% of respondents to an industry survey said they will cruise again.
Loyal customers can keep cruise industry afloat
While cruising has resumed in Europe, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control imposed a “no sail” order that has not yet been lifted in North America.
“It’s not clear when the ships will set sail again, but I believe they will be cruising near full utilization quicker than many people expect,” Saligman says.
Although cruise stocks have rebounded from their March lows, Saligman believes select cruise lines continue to represent opportunity for long-term investors.
What’s more, with intense focus on healthy sailing practices, “There’s a case to be made that they could one day be considered among the cleanest places on earth to vacation,” says equity portfolio manager Chris Buchbinder.
Vacation plans up in the air
As was the case in the cruise industry, global air travel was down an estimated 66% in 2020, about 20 times worse than the previous record. Within the U.S., which is more dependent on business travel, the devastation was worse: Air travel declined as much as 95% in the early months of the crisis.
The rollout of the vaccines and prior experience gives Saligman confidence that demand will bounce back. “I believe it will happen quickly as the vaccine rolls out,” he says. “We also saw this after the September 11 attacks. A lot of people thought consumers would never fly again, and traffic recovered quickly.” 
Indeed, in China, where the virus is largely under control and the economy has rebounded, domestic air travel has nearly returned to pre-COVID levels.
Air travel in China has soared back. Will the U.S. soon follow?
The ripple effect
A revival in travel demand can also have a powerful ripple effect, creating the need for a range of goods and services and helping drive job growth across a variety of industries. Among these are aircraft manufacturers, jet engine makers, hotels, casinos and restaurants — all of which were devastated by the pandemic.
Consider aircraft engine makers, which operate a recurring revenue business model. Companies like Safran and General Electric build the engines and sell them at a modest profit, but the engines must be serviced regularly, and the engine makers can generate a great deal of revenue from the service contracts.
“They're not making any money this year, because airplanes are grounded, but as air travel resumes, those manufacturers will potentially see their cash flows rebound,” Buchbinder says.
Unlike other sectors of the economy during COVID, aircraft engine makers are not going to see digital disruption upend their business. “After all,” Buchbinder adds, “there are no digital aircraft engines.”
Markets tend to anticipate recoveries
Markets often anticipate recoveries in the underlying economy, so it’s important to recognize underlying trends early. Consider the global financial crisis, a period when the housing and automobile industries were severely beaten down. By 2012 it became clear that demand was building, thanks to changing demographics and an aging auto fleet. In both industries, a full recovery took several more years, but a rebound in auto- and housing-related stocks anticipated the recovery in demand and earnings. From February 2009 through December 2010, auto sales fell 6% while auto stock returns advanced 496%.
Auto stocks rebounded ahead of sales after the global financial crisis
More recently, since the introduction of the vaccines, shares of companies across a number of travel-related industries have registered strong gains. Select companies likely have room to run, Buchbinder says. 
“The market often runs ahead of the actual recovery in earnings,” he says. “I think a year from now we will be in a very different environment where demand and earnings for some of these companies will begin to recover in a more meaningful and sustained way. Our job as investors is to identify those companies that stand to benefit most from the changing environment.”
Maintaining a balance
Students of history can look to many examples of past crises and declines that were followed by powerful recoveries thanks in part to pent-up consumer demand. Examples include the travel sector after 9/11 and the housing and auto industries following the end of the great financial crisis in 2008–2009. 
As long-term investors, Capital Group’s investment professionals seek to identify trends early enough to select the companies that stand to benefit from these dynamics. For investors and their advisors, it is important to make sure portfolios are balanced with exposure not only to growth strategies but also to strategies focused on more value-oriented companies, like many of the travel-related stocks.
A review of more than 4,000 portfolios by Capital Group’s Portfolio & Analytics team found that investors significantly reduced allocations to value equities over the last three years. It may be time to rebalance. 
Returns for leading growth companies have continued to be strong, for good reason. But it may be shortsighted for investors to become seduced by the runaway growth stories, considering that many of the beaten down stocks in travel and other sectors have attractive valuations. And recently there have been some early signs that the market rally may be broadening as many of these stocks have posted meaningful gains.
Investors have scaled back their exposure to value funds
“We’ve just been through a market downturn and recovery where the great secular growth companies led during the decline and on the way back up,” Buchbinder says. “That is a historically unusual pattern. As the vaccines roll out and the recovery broadens we will begin to see companies in the travel industry, or perhaps energy or financials, all of which had been very hard hit during the downturn, participate in the recovery.”

President Biden’s policy agenda got a significant boost from Georgia voters.
Large tax increases still look like an uphill climb, but no longer appear impossible.
Technology companies are likely to face more regulatory risk.
As President Joe Biden takes office, the prospects for his policy agenda appear more robust than previously thought, following a Georgia runoff election that flipped control of the U.S. Senate.
With Democrats now in charge of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives, some of Biden’s top legislative priorities may encounter less opposition between now and the 2022 midterm elections. But a 50-50 split in the Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tiebreaker, still means that major new legislation may require some degree of bipartisan support.
Without a commanding Democratic majority, the most ambitious elements of Biden’s agenda are likely to face a difficult, but not impossible, path to approval. That includes large tax increases for corporations and the wealthy, which some moderate Democrats may oppose along with many Republicans, especially while the U.S. economy continues to struggle with the COVID crisis.
“This is not a blue wave scenario,” says John Emerson, Vice Chairman of Capital Group International, Inc.SM and a former U.S. Ambassador to Germany. “With thin Democratic margins in the House and a 50-50 Senate, Democratic moderates will have a moderating influence on legislation. President Biden will work hard to gain bipartisan support where he can.”
Emerson also noted that, historically speaking, the U.S. stock market has performed well regardless of which party controls Washington. That includes many periods when Democrats ruled the White House and both houses of Congress — highlighted by a 26% return for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index coming out of the global financial crisis in 2009.
U.S. stocks have moved higher since the January 5 runoff election in Georgia, as well. In that race, Republicans unexpectedly lost both Senate seats, resulting in a 50-50 tie. With Vice President Kamala Harris’ pivotal role as tiebreaker, Democrats now control the Senate by a razor-thin margin. U.S. stocks rose to an all-time high on January 8, and continue to post modest gains on a year-to-date basis.
U.S. stocks have rallied under Democratic rule
U.S. economic outlook
In addition, the outlook for the U.S. economy is marginally better under a political power structure where Democrats may be able to push through larger stimulus bills and higher spending on infrastructure projects, among other spending priorities, says Capital Group economist Jared Franz.
With a vaccine-assisted recovery already underway, Franz expects the U.S. economy to grow at a greater than 3% pace in 2021 — and potentially 4% — depending on how quickly and effectively the government moves to distribute stimulus checks and vaccines to the public.
“Reaching 4% growth is entirely possible, driven by government stimulus efforts, rapid vaccinations and organic recovery from the 2020 downturn,” Franz explains. “My concern, however, is with the unemployment rate (currently 6.7%). I think it will come down slower than most economists expect amid rising layoffs and the retooling of the economy to a post-pandemic labor-light regime.”

Policy landscape takes shape
High-priority policy initiatives under the Biden administration are likely to include a modest corporate income tax hike, which previously appeared to be off the table when Republicans controlled the Senate.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 — the most significant piece of legislation passed under President Trump — reduced corporate income tax rates to roughly 21% from 32%. Under the new administration, there is a decent chance of that number moving up in a phased approach to approximately 25%, rather than the 28% tax rate that Biden proposed during the campaign, says Capital Group political economist Matt Miller.
“There probably will be corporate tax hikes at some point, but I think they will be tempered by the concerns of centrist Democrats who don’t want to go too far too fast,” Miller says. “A 50-50 plus the VP majority in the Senate is a different world compared to a 55-seat majority, and I think the outcome of Biden’s policy agenda will reflect that.”
Modest corporate tax increases could be on the way
The same holds true for many other hot-button issues, such as levying higher taxes on wealthy individuals and raising the federal minimum wage, both of which were high on the list of Biden’s campaign promises. “Remember, some of these Democratic Senators will be up for reelection in 2022, and they may not want to run on a platform of higher taxes,” Miller notes, “especially at a time when the Senate and House majorities are so narrow.”
The environment and climate change could move front and center as well, including policies to encourage green investing and more disclosure requirements for public companies related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters.
Is Big Tech in big trouble?
Another issue that will likely arise during Biden’s first year in office is greater regulation of the technology industry. Both Democrats and Republicans have supported cracking down on Big Tech in various ways, including more aggressive antitrust enforcement and eliminating some long-standing legislative protections for internet companies.
This is another area where the Georgia runoff election has had a big impact, Miller says, because a Republican Senate could have blocked Biden’s appointments to the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division, but that won’t happen in a 50-50 Senate.
“I think those appointments will be a lot more aggressive than they would have been if Georgia had gone the other way,” Miller says. “And that means, yes, there will likely be a renewed focus on tech regulation. I don’t know yet how much of a threat it poses to their business models, but it’s something we’ll need to watch closely. At a minimum, I think it will be more difficult for tech firms to gain government approval to grow by acquiring promising competitors.”
Ramped up COVID relief
Of all the issues competing for Biden’s attention, however, none will get higher priority than the COVID relief and economic recovery efforts already under way.
As the president laid out in a January 14 announcement, he will seek rapid approval of a $1.9 trillion spending package that includes $400 billion for vaccine deployment and school reopening, $350 billion to help state and local governments, and $1,400 direct payments to individuals, among other assistance for displaced workers.
The announcement came one day after the House moved to impeach Trump, meaning a Senate trial, if it happens, could compete for time with COVID-relief deliberations and result in legislative delays.
“For Biden’s first 100 days in office, the priority will be COVID, COVID, COVID,” Emerson stressed, “for the simple reason that everything else depends on it.”

241,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/us-election-results-policy-priorities.html,U.S. election results bring policy priorities into focus,Election,"November 11, 2020","Now that the results of last week’s U.S. elections are coming into focus, investor attention is shifting to the policy implications of a Joe Biden presidency. Bottom line: Don’t expect big, sweeping changes in the years ahead.
With a Democrat in the White House and Republicans likely maintaining control of the Senate, consequential changes will be difficult to achieve in a familiar environment of Washington gridlock. That may prove to be the best of both worlds from an investment perspective.
“Assuming the base case of a divided government holds, major tax increases should be off the table at least for the next two years,” says Jason Bortz, senior counsel at Capital Group who specializes in tax and retirement plan issues. “I think the 2017 tax cut bill — President Trump’s signature achievement — will stand.”
Of course, that outcome hinges on the continuation of a Republican majority in the Senate, and not all Senate races have been resolved, Bortz notes. Two Senate races in Georgia are headed for a January 5 runoff election, which could change the equation. However, it’s been 20 years since a Republican lost a Senate race in Georgia, which requires an outright majority to win statewide office.
U.S. corporate taxes are likely to remain low under a split Congress
Political uncertainty persists
In addition to Georgia’s unresolved status, a degree of uncertainty remains around the presidential election results. While Biden has been declared the winner by major news organizations, the Trump campaign has filed a flurry of lawsuits challenging the results — claiming election fraud and other irregularities in several key states. Recounts are also likely in Georgia and potentially other swing states where media outlets have declared Biden the winner.
While those efforts are unlikely to change the outcome, they can’t be completely dismissed either, says Capital Group political economist Matt Miller.
“I think we have to be prepared for a few weeks of litigiousness,” Miller says. “The Trump team will pursue every available legal challenge, and there could be some twists and turns before it’s all over. From an investor’s point of view, all we can do is keep calm and carry on while they work their way through the process.”

Policy priorities in motion
So what might change under a Biden administration?
The top priority will be a COVID-relief stimulus bill, which might even happen before Inauguration Day. The idea has bipartisan support; however, Democrats and Republicans have so far not been able to agree on a dollar amount. That could change now that Election Day has passed.
“After the dust settles, I am cautiously optimistic that the Senate can work with the House of Representatives to get something done,” says Reagan Anderson, a senior vice president on Capital Group’s government relations team. “In my estimation, there is bipartisan support for roughly $1 trillion in spending, which is half the size of the previous relief bill, but it’s probably a compromise that Republican and Democratic leaders can live with.”
Other Biden administration priorities may include a modest infrastructure spending bill, immigration reform and drug pricing reform — all of which have some level of Republican support. The environment and climate change probably will move front-and-center, as well, including policies to encourage green investing and more disclosure related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters.
On the other hand, as long as Congress remains split, specific tax policy proposals are not likely to see the light of day, including corporate and individual income tax increases, a capital gains tax hike and a financial transactions tax.
“We also expect no change to the Senate filibuster or to the number of justices on the Supreme Court, both of which became hot-button issues during the campaign,” Anderson adds.
The fiduciary rule and Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI)
Other policy priorities may be enacted through executive orders and federal agency regulations. “Changes that can be made without going through the legislative process will be high on the president’s agenda,” Bortz says. “It’s the means to affect change when you have divided government.”
In the retirement industry, Bortz expects fiduciary standards to once again come under the regulatory spotlight. The Trump administration is working to finalize a U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) proposal that would give an exemption allowing investment fiduciaries to receive variable compensation for nondiscretionary investment advice, as long as they acknowledge fiduciary status in writing and adhere to certain conduct standards under current securities law.
Biden’s team may nix that rule, even if it is finalized during the remaining months of the Trump administration. The new administration is also likely to start work on a proposal that is expected to track the controversial Obama-era fiduciary rule, which was struck down by a federal court in the early days of the Trump administration. 
Many prominent Democrats, including Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, have been supportive of tougher “standard of care” rules, arguing that current law does not go far enough to protect investors. Democratic leaders have also maintained that Reg BI does not adequately safeguard investors, and it is possible that a new SEC will tighten Reg BI’s requirements and take a firmer enforcement stance.
Recently, the DOL also finalized a regulation that will make it more challenging for plan sponsors to offer ESG funds in defined contribution (DC) plans, particularly within a default investment option like a target date fund. Democratic leaders and a large portion of the asset management industry have sharply criticized the rule. Democratic leaders might seek to water it down via DOL-led amendments or interpretive guidance, Bortz adds.
U.S.-China relationship will continue to be a key issue
Foreign policy
On the foreign policy front, U.S.-China relations will almost certainly remain the top priority under a Biden administration, says Michael Thawley, a Capital Group political economist and formerly Australia's ambassador to the United States. While Biden's foreign policy team will approach China in a more strategic and less confrontational fashion than Trump, they probably will take a tougher stance than the previous administration did under Obama.
Biden’s trade policy toward China will likely borrow some tactics from the Trump administration, such as the use of tariffs. Technology and investment restrictions will remain and will almost certainly be tightened, albeit in a more systematic and targeted way, Thawley adds, given the growing support for such measures in Washington.
""Overall, the trajectory of the U.S.-China relationship is becoming clearer, and the fundamentals would not be different under a Biden administration,"" Thawley says. ""The intensity of the strategic competition will not have diminished. In a few years, we could end up with a much more tightly defined but still substantial bilateral economic relationship.""

Investors should prepare for higher market volatility in the aftermath of Election Day.
Republicans will likely hold the Senate, resulting in a split Congress — an outcome that has historically resulted in higher market returns.
Despite the uncertainty, investors should remember that company earnings, not elections, drive the stock market.
The uncertainty of 2020 continues.
After turning out in record numbers, voters awoke Wednesday morning with no clear winner declared in the U.S. presidential election. In a race that has proven to be much closer than many polls had predicted, the outcome may remain unknown for days or even weeks.
“Patience will be the key to getting through this period of political uncertainty,” says John Emerson, Vice Chairman of Capital Group International and a former U.S. Ambassador to Germany. “There are literally millions of votes that have yet to be counted — including a large number of mail-in ballots — so a delay is not that surprising. We’ve been warning about this scenario for months.”
From an investment perspective, Emerson explains, it is likely that market volatility will persist at elevated levels until President Donald Trump or former Vice President Joe Biden is declared the winner. U.S. equity markets staged a strong rally on Election Day, with the S&P 500 Index rising 1.8%. On Wednesday morning, stocks continued to climb higher amid the uncertainty as results in several key states remained too close to call. Treasuries rallied, partially on the view that a split government could curtail prospects for excessive fiscal stimulus.
“There’s understandably a lot of anxiety right now,” Emerson adds, “but investors should think hard about adhering to their long-term investment goals, rather than reacting to near-term political events. That is often a mistake.”
Stocks have trended higher regardless of which party occupies the White House
Over the course of history, markets have powered through contested presidential elections, deadly pandemics and economic recessions — usually not within the same year — but they have powered through, nonetheless. Whether a Democrat or a Republican occupies the White House has made little difference to overall long-term investment returns.
Where do we go from here?
The stage has been set for vote-counting battles and a flurry of lawsuits in swing states that have not yet been called for Biden or Trump. As of Wednesday morning, those states included Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia, according to The Associated Press.
“Thursday or Friday is probably the earliest we will know the preliminary vote results for each state, depending on the looming litigation,” says Matt Miller, a political economist and policy analyst with Capital Group. “The presidency could go either way in the fraught overtime ahead.”

Looking at the initial tally on election night, the nation essentially remains just as divided as it was four years ago when Trump unexpectedly won the 2016 election. “At midnight, Biden had 64.6 million votes and Trump had 63.2 million — on the way to what might be a record 160 million total votes,” Miller notes. “Whoever wins this election will have the daunting task of trying to bring unity and healing to a nation that is split right down the middle.”
In other races, it appears likely that Republicans will hold a majority in the U.S. Senate, although that’s not certain just yet, Miller says, while Democrats will maintain control of the House of Representatives, resulting in a split Congress. That’s been the case since the 2018 midterm elections when Republicans lost the House. Coincidentally, according to our analysis, markets have performed best under a split Congress.
Uncertainty index is elevated and far higher than previous election cycles
Two key issues in the race
The U.S. economy and the coronavirus outbreak were the top two issues in the presidential contest, according to most polls. Trump was generally viewed unfavorably for his handling of the pandemic, while voters gave him higher marks for his economic policies. The U.S. fell into a recession earlier this year, as government-imposed lockdowns brought economic activity to a near standstill.
However, in the most recent measure of U.S. economic activity — released just five days before the election — U.S. GDP growth bounced back sharply, rising at a 33.1% annual rate, benefiting from pent-up consumer demand and massive government stimulus measures. A key driver has been U.S. home sales, which have benefited from rising demand and historically low mortgage rates.
Returns have historically been strongest when Congress is split
Despite extreme volatility during the year, U.S. equity markets also have trended upward. On a year-to-date basis through October 30, the S&P 500 Index gained 2.8% as technology and consumer-tech stocks rallied amid the lockdowns.
“The near-term performance of the economy and the markets may have played a role in this election but, realistically speaking, presidents get far too much credit and far too much blame for what is happening in the economy and the markets,” says Capital Group economist Darrell Spence. “For the most part, the dynamics that contribute to economic growth and market returns are put in place long before the election and they remain long afterward.
“As investors, we try to focus on the underlying fundamentals that are driving the economy and corporate profitability,” Spence notes. “That often has very little to do with who happens to win an election.”

244,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/us-election-uncertainty.html,Election uncertainty looks increasingly certain,Election,"October 7, 2020","Remember all the turmoil over those hanging chads in Florida? The 2020 U.S. presidential election could make that dispute look quaint by comparison. In a year when seemingly everything has gone wrong, it is highly likely that Election Day will add another element of uncertainty to a most uncertain time.
“I've been involved in presidential politics going back to the 1980s, and I have to say this is the most unusual election of my lifetime — and probably anyone’s lifetime who is alive today,” says John Emerson, Vice Chairman of Capital Group International, Inc.SM and a former U.S. Ambassador to Germany.
“We have a pandemic, an economic crisis, civil unrest in the streets and, in the middle of it all,” he adds, “a dispute over a Supreme Court appointment suddenly enters the mix.” The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to begin confirmation hearings on October 12 for President Donald Trump’s nominee, setting the stage for a partisan battle three weeks before the election.
Adding yet another layer of uncertainty: Last week President Trump and his wife, Melania, tested positive for COVID-19. It remains to be seen how that could impact the campaign but, at a minimum, it places the pandemic back at the center of the race. “Of course, our thoughts are with the President and First Lady wishing them a speedy recovery,” Emerson says.
Uncertainty index is elevated and far higher than previous election cycles
To put things in perspective, the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index — which tracks a mix of economic, policy and media-related uncertainty measurements — has hit unprecedented levels in 2020. Investors may be wondering: What could possibly come next?
Mail-in ballots may trigger Election Day turmoil
Instead of hanging chads — which got the spotlight in the 2000 election — mail-in ballots could be the central issue this time.
Largely due to the COVID-19 outbreak, a record 80 million Americans are expected to vote by mail in this election cycle rather than visit the polls in person. That means election officials will be processing more than twice as many postal ballots as they did during the last presidential campaign in 2016.
Unless it’s a clear landslide for President Trump or former Vice President Joe Biden, “the outcome of the presidential election probably won’t be known for days or even weeks,” Emerson says, as states deal with the unprecedented volume of postal ballots. High levels of market volatility would likely accompany this period of uncertainty, he adds.
Moreover, Democrats are requesting mail-in ballots in much higher numbers than Republicans. This could set up a scenario where Election Day results appear to favor Republicans and then mail-in ballots — which take longer to count — shift the outcome toward Democrats. Either way, court challenges are a predictable outcome.
More Democrats than Republicans are voting by mail
Expect the counting to continue well past Election Day
Some states don’t start counting mail-in ballots until Election Day. A few of them are key swing states where the presidential election could be decided, including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. By contrast, other swing states such as Arizona and Florida start tallying mail-in ballots two weeks and three weeks ahead of time, respectively, as the ballots are received.
In recent months the subject of mail-in balloting has become highly politicized. However, putting those partisan arguments aside, the simple fact remains that many states have never before handled such a high volume of postal ballots. Under the best circumstances, it will be a challenge to count the votes in a timely manner.
“We have to be patient,” says Reagan Anderson, a Senior Vice President with Capital Group’s government relations team. “Just because it takes longer to count the votes doesn’t mean there’s fraud involved. We may have to wait a while to ensure we get an accurate count so the American people can trust the validity of the results.”
A state-by-state map for Election Day confusion
Will the U.S. Supreme Court step in again?
The disputed 2000 election was ultimately decided 36 days later when the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 vote, effectively ended recounting efforts in Florida. A key element of the decision involved a strict deadline: Under federal law, each state must determine its electors six days before the Electoral College meets.
That deadline was December 12, 2000 — an impossible task to meet if recounts were permitted to continue in Florida. The court handed down its decision that same day, and former Vice President Al Gore conceded the next day. In the closest election in U.S. history, President George W. Bush won with 271 electoral votes, one more than he needed.
Could the Supreme Court be called upon again? And will that deadline — this year it’s December 8 — play a similar role? Only time will tell.
“At the end of the day, I think it's important to keep in mind we will have a result,” Emerson stresses. “We will have a president, and I believe we will have a peaceful transition of power.”
For long-term investors, it’s important to remember that, historically speaking, the political power structure in Washington, D.C., hasn’t had much of a discernible impact on equity market returns. From 1933 to 2019, under unified and split governments, the average annual return for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index has fallen into a broad range from roughly 7% to 10%. A split Congress, as we have today, appears to be the market’s favorite choice, having generated an average return of 10.4%.
Returns have historically been strong regardless of the makeup of Washington
Investment implications:
Investors should prepare for rising market volatility as Election Day approaches.
Patience is key, as the outcome of the U.S. presidential race may not be known for days or weeks.
The sheer volume of mail-in ballots means delayed results are probably inevitable.
Despite the uncertainty, investors should remember that markets have eventually moved higher even in turbulent times.

245,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/us-political-change.html,U.S. political change: Sweeping or incremental?,Politics,"September 23, 2020","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Significant U.S. policy changes are on the horizon, regardless of which party prevails in November.
Despite the divisive rhetoric, the American political left and right have some key priorities in common.
Infrastructure spending, lower health care costs and higher wages are largely bipartisan issues.
Roughly six weeks ahead of pivotal U.S. elections,  one thing is becoming increasingly clear: Profound policy changes are on the horizon no matter which political candidates prevail.
Certain critical issues facing the nation — income inequality and rising health care costs, for instance — have reached an inflection point where Democrats and Republicans alike are proposing solutions that would have been politically untenable just a few years ago. The only questions, in my view, are how quickly policy changes will come, whether they will be sweeping or incremental, and how they will affect the U.S. economy and markets. 
With those questions in mind, a multidisciplinary research team at Capital Group recently took a deep dive into the issues and reached some initial conclusions, including:
In the long-running conflict between labor and ownership, the political pendulum is swinging toward labor, but the strength of the turn may not be as strong as investors envision. Despite intensifying societal imbalances exposed by the COVID-19 outbreak, there are plenty of crosscurrents that could and probably will slow that momentum.
Some key issues — such as affordable health care, higher paying jobs and addressing the nation’s deteriorating infrastructure — are not solely a focus of the American political left. The right will also likely pursue these important goals, but with broadly different policy tools.
Both parties have crossed the Rubicon of fiscal conservatism in the pandemic era. Large deficit spending will almost certainly continue regardless of which party is in power. However, the opposition party may find a return to fiscal restraint politically useful after the November 3rd elections.
Three areas of agreement
COVID economic recovery. If COVID-19 is not contained and there is no pandemic-ending vaccine, the 2021 legislative agenda will focus on economic recovery. Depending on the path of the pandemic, additional stimulus bills could be on the way, along with other fiscal and monetary stimulus measures. To underscore how much the political lines have blurred, a GOP senator in April proposed that the federal government cover up to 80% of wages for all employees of U.S. businesses impacted by state-imposed lockdowns. More unconventional approaches may be necessary in the event of another COVID wave next year. 
U.S.-China trade tensions. Largely viewed as a Trump-induced conflict, U.S.-China trade tensions wouldn’t miraculously disappear under a Biden administration. A growing bipartisan consensus in Washington views a tense U.S.-China relationship as a long-term reality that will shape trade and foreign policy decisions for many years to come. One area of broad agreement is the need for greater protections for intellectual property, which is likely to be a high priority under a Democratic or a Republican administration.
Technology regulations. Both parties have expressed frustrations with Big Tech companies, raising the prospect of antitrust actions, tougher regulations and greater oversight in the areas of privacy protection and suppression of political viewpoints. A breakup of perceived tech monopolies might be more likely under a left-leaning government, but there are supporters of this move on both sides of the political aisle.
Four areas of disagreement
Tax policy. Taxation is undoubtedly the biggest source of disagreement, with Democrats proposing higher income taxes for corporations and wealthy individuals, along with a capital gains tax increase, and Republicans arguing for deeper tax cuts as a follow-up to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. On the political left there is also strong support for increasing the federal minimum wage, while the right may prefer to limit low-wage immigration as a way to boost employees’ wages.
Education. Attempts to solve education inequality are highly partisan, and we are likely to see drastically different paths under a Democratic or Republican administration. A right-leaning government would favor school choice initiatives and reducing the influence of teachers’ unions, while a left-leaning government would likely pursue greater investments in public schools, early childhood development and student debt relief.
Immigration. Another highly partisan issue, immigration policy is likely to undergo major change if Democrats win the White House and the Senate. We could see an easier path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., along with expanded protections for asylum seekers. A Republican administration would likely continue to increase border security and seek to limit low-wage immigration.
Supreme Court. With the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a new issue has emerged that could dramatically change the dynamics of the election. The appointment of Ginsburg’s replacement is likely to be a defining issue as we enter the final weeks of the 2020 election cycle.
Investment implications
Equities. Equity markets are likely to continue benefiting from a low interest rate environment under all four likely election scenarios — Trump wins and the Senate remains in Republican control; Trump wins and Democrats take the Senate; Biden wins and Democrats take the Senate; Biden wins and Republicans maintain Senate control. Growth-oriented stocks are particularly attractive with rates at historic lows. However, periods of extreme volatility should be expected given the economic uncertainty that prompted central banks to pursue zero- and negative-rate policies in the first place.
Fixed income. 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields are likely to remain in the range of 0.5% to 1.5% under three of the four scenarios. The exception could be the so-called “blue wave” scenario — Biden wins the White House and Democrats take the Senate — in which case, bond yields could move higher (1.5% to 2.0%) as a Democratic administration finds it easier to advance its policy agenda, potentially boosting U.S. economic growth in the process.
Sector impacts. Broadly speaking, sectors and companies that stand to benefit from the substantial political change of a blue wave include health care plan operators, environmentally focused companies (solar, wind, electric, etc.), discount retailers and small technology firms. A right-leaning government would likely foster a relatively more favorable environment for pharmaceutical companies, U.S.-based manufacturing companies and the energy industry.
That said, it’s important to remember that attempting to time the markets based on expected political outcomes has proven to be an extremely difficult task. History has shown that long-term investors are better served by staying invested — even during times of substantial political volatility — as markets have tended to power through even the most tumultuous election cycles.

246,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/how-elections-move-markets-5-charts.html,How elections move markets in 5 charts,Election,"September 16, 2020","How much do elections impact the stock market and portfolio returns? Should elections even matter to long-term investors in the first place? These are the questions investors and financial professionals are facing as we approach November 3rd. To provide answers, we’ve analyzed more than 85 years of data and identified five ways that elections influence markets and investor behavior.
1) Markets have tended to predict election results
A simple stock market metric has correctly predicted the winner in 20 of the last 23 presidential elections since 1936 — a track record that might make even the top pollsters jealous. If the S&P 500 Index is up in the three months prior to Election Day, the incumbent party usually wins. If markets are down during that period, the opposing party typically claims victory.
Why is this? It’s because equities tend to look ahead and “price in” uncertainty — including that caused by an upcoming election.
When the stock market and the economy are strong, there is usually less motivation for a change in leadership. In those years, stocks may not need to discount the uncertainty, which often allows stocks to continue rising, further bolstering the incumbent’s chance of reelection.
When the political and economic climate are more challenging, there is a greater chance that the opposing party will win. The market discounts the added uncertainty of the election outcome and what policy changes may occur, which can lead to higher volatility.
What does this mean for 2020? As of September 15, the S&P 500 is up 3% since August 3rd (three months prior to Election Day) and 5% year-to-date. In more normal times that would favor the incumbent, but today’s shaky economy offers a different story. Since 1912, only once has a president been reelected if he oversaw a recession within two years of the election. While this trend may be interesting, investors shouldn’t use it as an excuse to try to time markets. Historically, whether the incumbent wins or loses, election volatility has usually been short-lived and quickly given way to upward moving markets.

2) Gridlock or sweep? Equities have gone up either way
One of the biggest concerns investors have this election cycle is the possibility of a Democratic sweep of the White House and Congress. Many assume this so-called “blue wave” will lead to a reversal of policies like deregulation or the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. While it’s true that a new party typically brings its own policy agenda, assuming such an outcome will lead to meaningfully lower stock prices is probably over-simplifying the complexities of stock markets.
History shows that stocks have done well regardless of the makeup of Washington. Since 1933, there have been 42 years where one party has controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress at the same time. During such periods, stocks have averaged double-digit returns. This is nearly identical to the average gains in years when Congress was split between the two parties. Historically the “least good” outcome has been when Congress is controlled by the opposite party of the president. But even this scenario notched a solid 7.4% average return.
What does this mean for 2020? This year’s election will almost certainly end in either a unified government under a blue wave or a split Congress, which could happen with either a Trump or Biden victory. Voters may have a strong preference, but investors should take comfort that both scenarios have historically produced strong equity returns.
3) Markets have trended higher regardless of which party wins the election
Politics can bring out strong emotions and biases, but investors would be wise to tune out the noise and focus on the long term. That’s because elections have, historically speaking, made essentially no difference when it comes to long-term investment returns.
Which party is in power hasn’t made a meaningful difference to stocks either. Over the last 85 years there have been seven Democratic and seven Republican presidents, and the general direction of the market has always been up. What should matter more to investors than election results is staying invested.
What does this mean for 2020? Some have called the 2020 election the most important in our lifetime. But that has been said about previous elections and will be said again about future elections. This year has been unique in countless ways, but a look at past election cycles shows that controversy and uncertainty have surrounded many campaigns. And in each case the market continued to be resilient. By maintaining a long-term focus, investors can position themselves for a brighter future regardless of the outcome on Election Day.
4) Investors often become more conservative in election years
It can be tough to avoid the negative messaging around election coverage. And it’s natural to allow the rhetoric of political campaigns to make us emotional. History has shown that elections have had a clear impact on investor behavior, but it’s important that investors don’t allow pessimism to steer them away from their long-term investment plan. 
Investors have poured assets into money market funds — traditionally one of the lowest risk investment vehicles — to a much greater degree in election years. By contrast, equity funds have seen the highest net inflows in the year immediately following an election.
This suggests that investors want to minimize risk during election years and wait until any uncertainty has subsided to revisit riskier assets like stocks. But market timing is rarely a winning investment strategy, and it can pose a major problem for portfolio returns.
What does this mean for 2020? This trend accelerated in 2020: Through July 31, net money market flows increased $546 billion while net equity fund flows decreased $36 billion. Of course, part of this year’s flight to safety was related to the pandemic-induced recession and not the election. Still, equity funds saw their largest monthly outflows in July, indicating that investors are remaining conservative ahead of the election.
5) Moving to cash in election years can reduce long-term portfolio returns
What has been the best way to invest in election years? It isn’t by sitting on the sidelines.
To verify this, we looked at three hypothetical investors, each with a different investment approach. We then calculated the ending value of each of their portfolios over the last 22 election cycles, assuming a four-year holding period.
The investor who stayed on the sidelines had the worst outcome 16 times and only had the best outcome three times. Meanwhile, investors that were fully invested or made monthly contributions during election years came out on top. These investors had higher average portfolio balances over the full period and more frequently outpaced the investor who stayed in cash longer. These results reflect four-year holding periods, but the divergence would be even wider if compounded over longer time frames.
Sticking with a sound long-term investment plan based on individual investment objectives is usually the best course of action. Whether that strategy is to be fully invested throughout the year or to consistently invest through a vehicle such as a 401(k) plan, the bottom line is that investors should avoid market timing around politics. As is often the case with investing, the key is to put aside short-term noise and focus on long-term goals.
What does this mean for 2020? It’s too early to know what the impact of this year’s flight to cash will be on investors’ long-term portfolio returns. But with the S&P 500 soaring over 50% since the March bottom and net equity selling continuing throughout the year, it is safe to assume many investors missed at least some of this powerful equity rally and remain on the sidelines ahead of the November election.

247,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/election-watch-2020.html,Election watch: What the U.S. race means for investors,Election,"July 29, 2020","Heading into 2020, there was little doubt that the U.S. presidential election would be the biggest story of the year. The coronavirus pandemic drastically changed that narrative, pushing the election aside as a health care crisis triggered the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.
With the election now less than 100 days away, however, investors are turning their attention back to the November 3 ballot. Amid rising COVID-19 infections, a battered economy and civil unrest in several U.S. cities, President Donald Trump is trailing former Vice President Joe Biden by a wide margin in major polls.
Many pundits are predicting defeat for the president, but it’s far too early for investors to anchor on that outcome, says Capital Group veteran political economist Matt Miller.
“We have more than three months to go before the election. That’s a lifetime in politics,” Miller says. “Given the rapid pace of developments and a compressed news cycle, we could have many turns of the wheel between now and November. In my view, the race will tighten as the Republican and Democratic campaigns shift into overdrive.”
Election scenario planning
For long-term investors, the outcome of U.S. presidential elections hasn’t mattered as much as staying invested and maintaining a diversified portfolio. Markets have tended to power through presidential elections — with some volatility along the way — regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican won the White House.
That said, election scenario planning plays a role in macroeconomic analysis, particularly in recent years as governments have increasingly intervened in the financial markets during times of crisis.
Excluding a contested election — which is certainly within the realm of possibility — here’s a brief look at four scenarios that could play out in November and potential implications for investors.
Scenario 1: Democratic sweep
Democrats win the White House, the Senate and maintain control of the House — otherwise known as a “blue wave.” This scenario would produce the greatest degree of political change, starting with the likely reversal of Trump’s policy agenda on many fronts, including taxes, immigration and regulation.
One result could be a full or partial rollback of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which included significant tax reductions. Overall corporate tax rates declined from 35% to 21%, providing a major boost to corporate earnings. A full or partial reversal would have the opposite effect, prompting investors to take that into account when estimating the overall corporate earnings outlook.
“We would see a much bigger emphasis on taxation and regulation across the board, with significant implications for the energy sector, telecommunications and technology companies,” Miller explains. “We could also see the elimination of the filibuster in the Senate, which, unlike today, would allow legislation to pass with a simple majority vote.”
Scenario 2: Gridlock
Biden wins the White House; Republicans maintain control of the Senate. This outcome would likely result in a gridlock scenario where it could be difficult to pass major legislation. Senate Republicans could block major Democratic initiatives, much as they did during the second term of the Obama presidency.
“In this case, I think we would see Biden governing through executive orders,” says Clarke Camper, head of government relations in Capital Group’s Washington, D.C. office. “There would be a great deal of pent-up frustration on both sides of the aisle. That’s an easy outcome to predict, though, perhaps not as easy to live with.”
Under this scenario, federal regulatory agencies would also likely exercise more power. From a financial markets perspective, that could mean more aggressive enforcement by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as a renewed policy push by the Department of Labor in connection with its oversight of employee retirement plans.
Scenario 3: Status quo
Trump wins reelection, and Republicans keep the Senate. This scenario involves the least amount of change since it is, indeed, where we are today. The House is likely to remain in Democratic hands, so the current environment of political confrontation would continue — along with the rancorous attempts to approve COVID-19 relief legislation, including the $2 trillion CARES Act.
“Regardless of who is in the White House in January, there's going to be a lot of post-COVID cleanup work to do,” explains Reagan Anderson, a senior vice president with Capital’s government relations team. “Today we are in stabilization mode, and we will hopefully be moving into recovery mode by 2021.”
Scenario 4: Unlikely split
Trump wins reelection, and Democrats take the Senate. This scenario could set the stage for even greater hostility than we’ve seen in the past two years. While such an outcome is theoretically possible, it’s unlikely given the political dynamics of key Senate races, which increasingly track the presidential vote in each state.
“For instance, if Republicans lose key Senate races in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina, then that’s clearly indicative of a ‘blue wave,’” Miller explains. “It’s hard to imagine Trump winning the White House if that happens.”
Either scenario involving Trump’s reelection raises another risk: If he wins without a majority of the popular vote as he did in 2016, Miller warns, that could lead to more civil unrest and further demands to abolish the Electoral College.
Investment implications
Election season can be a tough time for investors to maintain a long-term perspective, given the strong emotions often evoked by politics. Campaign rhetoric tends to amplify negative and divisive issues. This election, in particular, is unprecedented in modern times — marked by the combination of a deadly pandemic, a global economic recession, widespread civil unrest and extreme market volatility.
Moving to the sidelines would be an understandable approach for anxious investors who prefer to wait and see what happens. As history has shown, however, that is often a mistake. What matters most is not election results, but staying invested.
Consider the historical performance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index over the past eight decades. In 18 of 19 presidential elections, a hypothetical $10,000 investment made at the beginning of each election year would have gained value 10 years later. That’s regardless of which party’s candidate won. In 15 of those 10-year periods, a $10,000 investment would have more than doubled. While past results do not guarantee future returns, election-year jitters should not deter investors from maintaining a long-term perspective.
The only negative 10-year period followed the election of George W. Bush in the year 2000. During that decade, the S&P 500 posted a negative return amid two seismic events: the 2000 dot-com crash and 2008 global financial crisis.
In contrast, the biggest election year return would have been in 1988, when George H. W. Bush won office, and $10,000 would have grown to $52,567 by the end of 1997.
By design, elections have winners and losers, but the real winners have been investors who stayed the course and avoided the temptation to time the market.

248,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/nightwatch-market-disruptions.html,The Night Watch sheds daylight on market disruptions,Market Volatility,"July 15, 2020","On the surface, it seems unlikely that a 17th century Dutch painting would have much relevance in today’s volatile investment environment. But if you take a moment to look at Rembrandt’s masterpiece, “The Night Watch,” you may notice that every person depicted in the painting is looking in a different direction, each bringing a unique view to the gathering.
Flash-forward nearly 400 years and “The Night Watch” is the inspiration for a multidisciplinary research team at Capital Group that seeks to gain a deeper understanding of market disruptions, assessing the risks and evaluating the opportunities that arise during times of extreme crisis. Not surprisingly, the group’s current focus is COVID-19.
“The goal of the Night Watch is to look at highly uncertain events, where the outcome is essentially unknowable, and study them from all angles,” explains Capital Group economist Jared Franz, who covers the U.S. and Latin America. “Like the individuals in the painting, we are looking out in all directions, evaluating possible scenarios and considering potential outcomes.”
Scenario planning, not predictions
""The No. 1 rule of the Night Watch is: Leave your preconceived notions at the door. Don’t start with what you think will happen, look at what could happen,” adds Julian Abdey, an equity portfolio manager and active participant in the group. ""This is about evaluating the possible scenarios — from very negative to very positive — and understanding what each would mean for a variety of asset prices. At the end, it is up to the different investment units and individual portfolio managers and analysts to determine how probable each one is.""
This concept goes to the heart of The Capital System℠, which relies on the multiple and diverse perspectives of Capital Group’s investment professionals, combined with independent, high-conviction decision-making. The Night Watch doesn’t make investment decisions on its own, but it helps inform the larger organization.
The idea for Capital's Night Watch approach was formed in the aftermath of the 2008–09 global financial crisis to engage in scenario planning around severe downside events. In more recent years, the team explored the risk of rising corporate debt levels. This year, the group took on perhaps its most daunting crisis: the coronavirus outbreak and resulting government lockdowns that have triggered the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.
Corporate debt dilemma
In the corporate debt analysis, the Night Watch team raised an early alarm about rising debt levels and deteriorating credit conditions in the U.S. corporate bond market.
Following the financial crisis, ultra-low interest rates and central bank bond-buying activities created an environment where many companies could borrow vast sums of money at historically low financing costs. The “hunt for yield” by some investors accelerated the process, encouraging companies to continue the borrowing binge despite a late-cycle economic environment. Even more worrisome: Companies with relatively low credit ratings accounted for more than 50% of the market last year.
“We could see that soaring levels of corporate debt were producing an imbalance in the economy,” says Franz — whose formula for anticipating a recession is equal parts late-cycle economy, rising imbalances and some catalyst to set it all off. “We worked closely with our fixed income team to quantify the downside risk in specific corporate bonds so they could make those investment decisions on a security-by-security basis.”
This approach to bond investing is an important part of maintaining a balanced and actively managed portfolio, explains fixed income portfolio manager John Queen.
“One of the real strengths of the Night Watch and other multidisciplinary research groups is the fact that we have multiple views — or multiple eyes, so to speak — on each problem,” Queen says. “We also have analysts who are investors, so when a crisis comes along, we already know the industries and the companies well, and we can act quickly if needed to address the unfolding events.”

Confronting the virus
In its ongoing coronavirus analysis, the Night Watch group has, again, studied the crisis from all angles, including the economic, market and health implications. The team has looked closely at many recession and recovery scenarios: V-shaped, U-shaped, W-shaped, L-shaped and even a Nike-style swoosh. In doing so, they’ve put together a weekly dashboard to help track in real-time which scenarios are more likely.
In terms of the U.S. economy, evidence is mounting for a U-shaped recovery, Franz says. Massive government stimulus measures are helping to soften the economic impact, but rising infection rates in many U.S. states are complicating the recovery effort.
“There’s still a lot we don’t know about the virus, and I think the next few months are going to be tough,” Franz says. “But longer term, a year or so down the road, I think the chances of developing a vaccine are good, and that bodes well for a stronger recovery in late 2021 or early 2022.”
Indeed, global equity markets are telegraphing such a recovery, given the extraordinary rally since late March. From a historical perspective, that pattern has played out many times before as markets powered through previous outbreaks, including Swine flu, MERS, Ebola and the Zika virus.
Investment implications
Investing during the COVID-19 outbreak has, in some ways, accelerated trends that were already in place prior to the pandemic, such as the growth of e-commerce and cloud computing. The virus has hastened the decline of some companies, such as traditional retailers, that were already struggling to survive. But it has also devastated some industries that were previously doing well, particularly travel and tourism — meaning the outlook is very much sector-by-sector and company-by-company.
Companies such as Amazon, Netflix and Shopify have benefited greatly from the “stay at home” era, while companies such as Airbus, Boeing and Royal Caribbean have suffered. However, both scenarios may present compelling investment opportunities, notes equity portfolio manager Anne-Marie Peterson.
“My approach is more micro than macro, but there’s no question that the macro environment right now is creating a period of extraordinary change,” Peterson says. “Some companies are getting stronger, some are getting weaker and some are going away. I think what the Night Watch team highlights is that we have an incredible group of researchers that evaluates these macro events on a very deep level, helping us to understand the risks and ultimately to act on the long-term investment opportunities that often emerge during times of crisis.”

The Capital Group companies manage equity assets through three investment groups. These groups make investment and proxy voting decisions independently. Fixed income investment professionals provide fixed income research and investment management across the Capital organization; however, for securities with equity characteristics, they act solely on behalf of one of the three equity investment groups.
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. Small-company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.

Especially now, when COVID-19 and its economic impact are fueling feelings of uncertainty around the world.
But while bear markets can be extraordinarily difficult, they also can be moments of great opportunity. Investors who find the courage and conviction to stick to their long-term plans have often been rewarded as markets bounced back.

3 facts about market recoveries
Fact #1: Recoveries have been much longer and stronger than downturns
The good news is bear markets have been relatively short compared to recoveries. They can feel like they last forever when we’re in them, but in reality they are much less impactful compared to the long-term power of bull markets.
Although every market decline is unique, the average bear market since 1950 has lasted 14 months. The average bull market has been more than five times longer.
The difference in returns has been just as dramatic. Even though the average bull has averaged a 279% gain, recoveries are rarely a smooth ride. Investors must often withstand scary headlines, significant market volatility and additional equity declines along the way. But investors who remain focused on the long term are often better equipped to look past the noise and stick to their plan.
Fact #2: After large declines, markets have recovered relatively quickly
We don’t know exactly what the next recovery will look like, but history shows us that stocks have often recovered sharply following steep downturns. We tracked the 18 biggest market declines since the Great Depression, and in each case the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index was higher five years later. Returns over those five-year periods averaged more than 18% per year.
Returns have often been strongest after the steepest declines, bouncing back quickly from market bottoms. The first year following the five biggest bear markets over the last 90 years averaged 71%, underscoring the importance of staying invested and avoiding the urge to abandon stocks during market volatility. While these have been the average returns during these recoveries, each one has differed, and it's quite possible any future recovery could be more muted.
Fact #3: Some of the world’s leading companies were born during market recoveries
Many companies got their start during tough economic periods and have gone on to become household names.
To highlight just a few: McDonald’s emerged in 1948 following a downturn caused by the U.S. government’s demobilization from a wartime economy. Walmart came along 14 years later, around the time of the “Flash Crash of 1962” — a period when the S&P 500 Index declined more than 22%. Airbus, Microsoft and Starbucks were founded during the stagflation era of the 1970s, a decade marked by two recessions and one of the worst bear markets in U.S. history. Not long after that, Steve Jobs walked into his garage and started a small computer company called Apple.
History has shown that strong businesses find a way to survive and even thrive when times are tough. Those that can adapt to difficult conditions and become stronger have often made attractive long-term investments.
Bottom-up, fundamental research is key to separating which companies may help lead a market recovery, and which are more likely to be left behind.
3 mistakes investors should avoid
Mistake #1: Trying to time markets
It’s time, not timing, that matters in investing. Taking your money out of the market on the way down means that if you don’t get back in at exactly the right time, you can’t capture the full benefit of any recovery.
Consider an example of a hypothetical investor who sold stocks during the market downturn of 2008–2009, and then tried to time the market, jumping back in when it showed signs of improvement. Missing even the 10 best days of the recovery would have significantly hurt that investor’s long-term results — and the more missed “good” days, the more missed opportunities.
Investors who are more hesitant to put all their excess capital to work at once may want to consider dollar cost averaging in volatile markets. Dollar cost averaging during a decline allows you to purchase more shares at a lower average cost, and when markets eventually rise, those extra shares can enhance your portfolio's value.
Mistake #2: Assuming today’s negative headlines make it a bad time to invest
Today’s economic and geopolitical challenges may seem unprecedented, but a look through history shows that there have always been reasons not to invest. Despite negative headlines, the market’s long-term trend has always been higher.
Consider a hypothetical investment in the S&P 500 on the day Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941. Someone who stayed invested for the next 10 years would have averaged a 16% annual return. Likewise, a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 on the day Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy on September 15, 2008, would have grown to over $30,000 10 years later. History has provided numerous examples of this.
Great investment opportunities often emerge when investors are feeling most pessimistic. The coronavirus outbreak may be unlike anything we have faced before, but uncertainty is nothing new to the market, which has been resilient over time.
Mistake #3: Focusing too much on the short term
Market volatility is especially uncomfortable when you focus on short-term ups and downs. Instead, extend your time horizon to focus on the long-term growth of your investments and the progress you’ve made toward your goals.
Consider the chart below that shows contrasting perspectives of the same hypothetical investment. The short-term view is one that many investors have of their portfolios — tracing returns over short periods of time. The long-term view plots the same exact investment over the same period, but shows annual change in the portfolio value invested instead. With this perspective, the short-term fluctuations of the first chart have smoothed out over time, and the picture of a growing portfolio becomes clearer.
Remember that bear markets don’t last forever. Maintaining a long-term perspective can help keep investors focused on the goals that matter most.
3 actions to consider in portfolios
Action #1: Run a portfolio checkup
Right now we are all focused on health and the well-being of our loved ones. This can also be a good time to check the health of your portfolio. Granted it’s hard to feel enthusiastic about investing when markets are turbulent. But after major moves in the stock market, it could be time to review your portfolio, and to ensure it is well-diversified, risk aware and aligned with investment objectives. 
Capital Group can help. We offer financial professionals the opportunity to conduct an in-depth analysis with our team of portfolio consultants. And if you’re an investor, now may be a good time to talk to your financial professional about getting a checkup on your portfolio. Request a consultation from our Portfolio Consulting & Analytics team.
Action #2: Upgrade your core bonds
Even if you believe equities are set for a strong recovery, fixed income should remain an important part of your portfolio. Recoveries are often choppy, and core bonds can provide an essential measure of stability and capital preservation. With interest rates expected to remain low for years to come, it’s not too late to get your core right.
Investors don’t necessarily need to change their portfolio weightings to bonds during periods of volatility, but they should review whether their fixed income investments contain enough high-quality core bonds that can provide adequate diversification from equities. 
While everyone expects the global economy to see the end of this turmoil in time, the path to recovery is still unknown. A balanced portfolio remains vital. 
Action #3: Expand your horizons
In uncertain times, it can be natural to narrow your perspective and only focus where you’re most comfortable. But if you can broaden your horizons beyond borders, you may be able to benefit from the growth potential of great companies in a variety of industries and markets.
And even if you think U.S. markets have bottomed and are poised for a strong recovery, don’t assume all the best stocks will come from America. Over the last prolonged bull market, the S&P 500 Index soundly outpaced its international peers, but three quarters of the top-returning stocks each year were based on foreign soil.
Investors seeking additional global or international exposure may want to consider funds with flexible mandates that allow their managers to choose from the best companies, no matter where they are located.

250,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/5-realities-weak-economy.html,5 realities of this recession,United States,"April 30, 2020","Recessions can be hard to predict, but that’s not the case this time. The COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the globe has pushed the U.S. economy into recession, with U.S. GDP falling 4.8% in the first quarter. While the drop was sizable, an even more pronounced decline is in store for the second quarter, as broad swaths of the country remain shuttered. With the U.S. feeling the sting of a sharp reduction in consumer spending and industrial production, there are five realities to keep in mind.
1) We’ve been here before (sort of)
The largest post-1950 quarterly GDP decline was 10% in the first quarter of 1958. 
This sharp drop in growth came amid the 1957–1958 recession, which resulted from a confluence of factors, including a flu pandemic. While the makeup of the present-day economy is much different, the U.S. is not unfamiliar with pandemic-related economic turmoil. The U.S. economy bounced back strongly in the late 1950s, with growth surpassing 5%.
As parts of the U.S. look to ease restrictions, I believe that a bounce back in activity could begin as early as June in some sectors and more broadly in the third quarter.
2) Recessions have tended to be short; the subsequent expansions have been powerful
The good news is that recessions generally haven’t lasted very long. While this time may be different, our analysis of 10 cycles since 1950 shows that recessions have ranged from eight to 18 months, with the average lasting about 11 months. For those directly affected by job loss or business closures, that can feel like an eternity. While there's no way to minimize that feeling, investors with a long-term investment horizon should try to look at the big picture. The average expansion increased economic output by 25%, whereas the average recession reduced GDP by less than 2%.
3) It’s about the consumer
The U.S. consumer accounts for approximately two-thirds of the economy. With unemployment claims skyrocketing — although many may be temporary — and consumers staying in their homes, a weakening economy is no surprise. The $2 trillion stimulus package will help support some levels of consumer activity, but employment uncertainty is likely to keep many consumers in a frugal mindset.
4) Lower oil prices may be a tailwind for the economy
A precipitous decline in crude oil prices has put pressure on the energy sector. May oil contracts turned negative in April as producers scrambled to find storage for bloated supply stores, exacerbated by consumers’ sharp reduction in vehicle usage and gasoline consumption. While the negative impact of lower oil prices is likely to be felt in U.S. oil fields, lower energy prices can provide a tailwind for consumers and transportation-heavy industries.
5) Timing may not be everything
Waiting for the all-clear may leave investors missing out on market gains. Since World War II, in recessions with a corresponding equity correction, the S&P 500 has bottomed, on average, three months before the end of each recessionary period. It’s little solace to investors who have endured market volatility, but even as the economy weakens, there are opportunities to invest in great companies at a discount.
While the adage that the stock market is not the economy is true, market volatility tends to be captured, with a lag, in economic data. So even as financial markets are on a path to recovery, it may take time for the economy to catch up. Focusing on long-term investing can help investors navigate short-term volatility.

251,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/what-need-know-cares-act.html,CARES Act: What investors and small businesses need to know,Regulation & Legislation,"April 8, 2020","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
The estimated $2 trillion CARES Act looks to provide cash to individuals and businesses through payments, loans and tax credits. 
The CARES Act waives certain requirements and penalties for qualified retirement plans. 
Small businesses may apply for relief loans of up to $10 million, but national banks may already be reaching capacity.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act is an estimated $2 trillion federal relief package designed to combat the harmful economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The law looks to provide cash infusions to individuals, businesses, health care organizations and state/local governments through payments, loans and tax credits.
The CARES Act, which congressional leaders put together and sent to the president’s desk in essentially warp speed, is designed to help businesses stay afloat — and, crucially, afford to continue to pay employees — during coronavirus-mandated shutdowns. 
“It’s a once-in a lifetime event,” says Reagan Anderson, senior vice president, government relations at Capital Group. Even the negotiation process – with people working remotely and finding new ways to have the critical back and forth conversations that accompany this type of bill – seems unprecedented. “The way it came together is different than anything I’ve experienced,” she says. 
Still, there are already questions about specific program details and concerns that more aid will be needed.
“This isn’t the end of the road,” says Jason Bortz, senior counsel at Capital Group. “Agencies are thinking about things that they can do themselves. There is already talk about a fourth stimulus bill.” He suspects pension funding relief is on the horizon, for example, which could bring additional changes to retirement plan rules in a year that’s already experienced sweeping legislation under the CARES and the SECURE acts.
As Washington continues to consider additional economic aid and relief measures,  we want to highlight some of the CARES provisions that we believe will be of interest to you.
What individuals need to know
Whether you participate in your company’s 401k plan, have a traditional or small business IRA, or you are in charge of a plan at your company, here are three key things to be aware of:
1. Special tax rules for coronavirus-related distributions 
For retirement savers who need to tap tax-deferred savings during this time of need, the CARES Act creates new rules for a coronavirus-related distribution (CRD) of up to $100,000 that includes four key benefits: 
It cushions the blow by waiving the 10% early-withdrawal penalty.
While income taxes are still owed on CRDs, taxpayers can spread the payments out over the next three years.
Withdrawals can be repaid to the retirement account within three years of the distribution. If repaid, any amount previously included in income could be exempted by filing a corrected return for the previous year. 
It’s not subject to otherwise mandatory 20% tax withholding. 
The ability to take CRD applies to anyone who has been diagnosed or whose spouse or dependent has been diagnosed with COVID-19, or who is experiencing adverse financial consequences as a result of being quarantined, furloughed, laid off, experiencing reduced work hours or lacking child care because of the coronavirus. Business owners who have to close or reduce business hours would also qualify. 
Unless such a special distribution is urgently needed, however, it’s generally recommended that clients continue to take advantage of tax-deferred growth and not take early distributions from their retirement accounts.
2. Suspended RMDs for retirement accounts
For retirement savers who prefer to delay distributions this year, required minimum distributions (RMDs) are suspended in 2020 for retirement account owners and beneficiaries. This applies to traditional, Roth, SEP and SIMPLE individual retirement accounts, as well as 401(k), 403(b) and governmental 457(b) plans. It means that individuals who turned 70½ in 2019 and were waiting until April 15, 2020, to take their RMDs now have until the end of 2021 to start taking distributions. Those who delayed first-time distributions in 2019 may skip RMDs for 2019 and 2020. Individuals who are already taking distributions may skip the 2020 RMD. However, an RMD may still make sense for someone in need of income or who expects to be in a lower tax bracket this year. 
Those who have taken an RMD in the past 60 days may have the option to undo it. If it’s returned to the retirement account, the distribution will be treated as a 60-day rollover. However, the person doing the rollover needs to be eligible for a 60-day rollover, which wouldn’t include nonspouse beneficiaries. If it’s been more than 60 days, there may still be an opportunity for a rollover. Bortz recalls in 2009, when RMDs were suspended due to market conditions, the IRS provided relief by extending the 60-day rollover rule. “The IRS is likely considering whether to provide similar relief with respect to RMDs waived under the CARES Act,” he says. Keep in mind, however, that only one rollover is allowed per year, although you may still be able to do transfers from one IRA to another. 
3. Beneficiary IRA distributions suspended  
The suspension of RMDs in 2020 applies to inherited IRAs as well. Retirement accounts that are currently subject to the five-year rule following the account owner’s death (generally, retirement accounts payable to an estate or other entity that did not qualify for stretch treatment) may skip counting 2020 among the five years. This means for a beneficiary subject to the five-year rule who inherited a retirement account between 2015 and 2019, the five-year rule is effectively a six-year rule. 
What small business owners need to know
If you are a small business owner, self-employed or working for a small company, here are three key things to be aware of:  
1. Paycheck Protection Program Loans
Businesses with fewer than 500 employees — including sole proprietors, independent contractors, “gig economy” workers and anyone otherwise self-employed — can apply for loans of up to $10 million, or 2.5 times total payroll expenses for the loan period. Sole proprietors and independent contractors should be eligible to apply by April 8. However, many large national banks are already reporting to be at or near lending capacity. 
Those who are able to access funds can use them to help pay for payroll costs and other expenses, such as mortgage payments, rent, utilities and other debt service from February 15 to June 30. At least 75% of the loan must be payroll and payroll costs (salary, wages, commissions and tips) are capped at $100,000 for each employee.
The loans are fully guaranteed by the federal government through the end of 2020 and can have a maturity of up to 10 years. Business owners will be able to apply for these loans at any lending institution approved to participate in the program through the existing U.S. Small Business Administration’s 7(a) lending program. 
Other notable provisions to the loan program:
The portion of the Paycheck Protection Program Loan that was used for the first eight weeks of payroll costs, interest on mortgage obligations, rent and utilities is eligible for permanent forgiveness.
Payments of principal and interest can be deferred for at least six months and for no more than one year. The interest rate is capped at 4%.
Businesses that laid off workers from February 15 to April 26 can be eligible for credit for loan forgiveness as long as those jobs and salaries are reinstated by June 30.
501(c)(3) charitable organizations with fewer than 500 workers can qualify as well. All entities must have been in operation as of February 15, 2020.
2. Expansion of the SBA Disaster Loan Program
This expansion enables sole proprietors to access disaster loans and enables them to receive a working capital loan to overcome the temporary loss of revenue. Entities that apply for a disaster loan can get an immediate advance of up to $10,000 to maintain payroll, and the advanced $10,000 does not have to be repaid even if the full loan application is later denied.
3. Other benefits for businesses
The employer’s portion of Social Security payroll tax payable in 2020 may be deferred until January 1, 2021, with the first half of the deferred 2020 payment due at the end of 2021 and the second half due at the end of 2022.
Employers may be eligible for up to one year of credit against the employer’s 6.2% share of Social Security tax for a business that is fully or partially suspended due to government orders, or where revenue in a quarter in 2020 is less than 50% of the revenue in the same quarter last year.
Employers may be eligible for more flexible net operating loss rules for access to an immediate refund.

252,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/rob-lovelace-looks-ahead.html,Rob Lovelace on what a recovery could look like,Market Volatility,"March 18, 2020","What does the world look like in 2022? It’s a guidepost that’s driving Capital Group Vice Chairman Rob Lovelace as markets remain volatile and the world copes with COVID-19.
“You have to stop and think about what will be different, as well as what will be back to normal, in 2022,” says Lovelace, who started his investment career at Capital in the mid-1980s. “When you are able to focus on how much will be the same and see the other side of the valley, that’s really reassuring. It was a much different situation during the 2008 financial crisis because we couldn’t see the other side of the valley and how we were going to reach it. But this time is different, and that gives me hope. While the global economy and financial markets are going to be challenged for some time and government leaders will have to make tough decisions, I believe we will make it through this.”
In a recent call from his home office, Lovelace shared his perspective on Capital’s response to the virus, the company’s business operations, his outlook for global markets and investment opportunities.
What is your outlook for global markets?
The impact of COVID-19 will be with us for some time, certainly into 2021, but will have a diminishing effect over time.
What we learned from China is that we need to act quickly, decisively and with discipline. Chinese equity markets have been relatively stable since they got their situation under control. For instance, Chinese stocks are down 15.9% since February 19 (the beginning of this particular bear market) through March 17, compared with a decline of 25.2% for the U.S., 21.6% for Japan and 31.4% for Europe.
There’s a bifurcation around the world in terms of the response to COVID-19.
If governments take swift action, it’s still a very big economic shock, but then you have a recovery like we’ve seen in China and Singapore. Along those lines, we already are working on getting some of our associates back to work in our Singapore office.
If those actions aren’t taken, you’ll likely wind up with a larger human shock and prolonged economic stress; that appears to be happening in Italy, Spain, the U.K., France and some other countries.
In the U.S., we are trying to decide which way we will go. We’ve done the initial moves, but if we don’t get increasingly locked down and really nip this in the bud, it will move faster and have a bigger impact. It makes it hard to know how wide the valley is. There will be a recession. The question is for how long, and that’s what’s unsettling the market.
The markets are recognizing that the different types of responses from governments will lead to different outcomes in the stock market. Either way, I believe we will get through this and end up in a better place 24 months from now. As long-term investors at Capital, that’s what we already see. It’s just the terrain along the valley floor that we don’t quite know yet.
What are you seeing within specific sectors?
Pharmaceutical companies are obvious beneficiaries, particularly in the U.S. and a few other companies around the world that are working on promising vaccines. And we have companies with excess capacity in their manufacturing lines so they can produce these vaccines if successfully tested and developed.
The consumer staples and food industries have been holding up in this environment, as are beverage makers. The real estate market should benefit from lower rates, but we could see some impact on the commercial side due to a potential hit to small businesses. Increased internet traffic helps phone and communications companies that benefit from higher data usage, and utilities benefit from lower rates. The positive trend for communications and utilities is most pronounced in markets outside the U.S.
Another interesting pattern I’d point out is that quality growth companies in the technology and internet spaces with strong cash flows and strong balance sheets have been holding up.
On the flip side, value stocks continue to struggle in this environment. Oil is running on a dual track, with the economic slowdown and the geopolitical fight between the Saudis and Russians. I ask some of my colleagues: If you wouldn’t buy an oil stock here, where would you buy it? Part of this is politically motivated, and ultimately things do come back.
As investors, we need to focus on what’s permanently changed. The analogy we use is to look across the valley and see the other side. It may be a rough ride, but I know some companies are going to do well. That’s personally what I’m focused on, particularly on some of the internet companies and market leaders we’ve had in our portfolios for a long time.
There are those companies for whom the world has fundamentally changed, such as the cruise line operators. Our analysis is focused on whether patterns have permanently changed for some industries, or will business be back to usual once we get through this?
One other point I would make: There will be a global baby boom that emerges from the quarantines and social distancing. My advice: Buy diaper companies.
How should we think about the Fed’s recent moves?
The Federal Reserve clearly signaled their concerns by cutting Fed Funds to near zero and instituting various extraordinary liquidity programs last used during the global financial crisis.
Providing liquidity to the system is important and absolutely necessary. We were hearing from our fixed income desks that liquidity has been challenging, even in U.S. Treasuries, typically the most liquid market in the world. To help improve liquidity, the Fed has restarted quantitative easing (QE) with a commitment to purchase $700 billion in Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities. The Fed also restarted the Commercial Paper Funding Facility to help ensure access for companies to short-term liquidity.
Unlike the Great Recession, the banks are healthy, in part because of the restructuring post 2008. Companies are drawing down lines of credit, and we are watching that closely. We will likely see government assistance to the aerospace, airline and hotel industries, similar to TARP in 2009. I also anticipate aid for hourly workers who may have reduced hours or lose their jobs here, as well as other forms of government support. I would view these kinds of actions as a positive.
How is Capital Group positioned to deal with current challenges?
Because we have offices in China and across Asia, we have dealt with these kind of market conditions and have overcome these challenges in the past. There was the SARS epidemic, which was regionally focused, and more recently we had the Hong Kong unrest. We learned a lot from those experiences. When the coronavirus emerged, we already had work from home protocols established in Asia and the technology to support our teams. As the situation worsened in Italy, we were in a position that enabled us to be days — and in some cases weeks — ahead of the industry and government directives.
Capital is built for bear markets and being a private company helps. We’re not focused on short-term quarterly earnings, and our associates are not worried about the company’s stock price or losing their job. That can be demoralizing, especially when your stock is losing value.
We have an incredibly strong balance sheet with no debt and a substantial amount of cash.
Another difference I believe that distinguishes us from publicly traded investment firms is we compensate our professionals the same way in down markets and up. This is particularly important for our investment group because our bonus pool is not based on our total assets under management, which can fluctuate depending on market conditions. We keep the formula exactly the same, emphasizing long-term results, and this helps our portfolio managers who may have been holding higher levels of cash and helps balance out the results in our funds.
Is COVID-19 affecting our research process?
As a global investment firm, our investment professionals frequently travel to different parts of the world, meeting with company management teams, government officials and suppliers. Many of us are road warriors, so working remotely is not a huge transition and we are accustomed to using video conferencing to interact.
Now we are all working from home, and that is giving us even more time to focus on analyzing the data and reflect on what's happening in the markets. We haven't even seen a dramatic drop-off in contacts with companies, because the companies themselves actually welcome video and phone conversations.
Company management teams are hunkered down at home too, and in some cases, they have reached out to our analysts to find out what we know about what is going on in the world and with their industry.
So, I would say our connections with management teams are as strong — or better than ever.

254,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/protecting-portfolios-coronavirus.html,Capital CEO Tim Armour on weathering the coronavirus,Market Volatility,"March 10, 2020","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
News of the continued spread of coronavirus — and the recent plunge in oil prices — has sent stocks plummeting toward bear market territory, and bond yields have reached unprecedented lows.
While the virus represents a new challenge, there is nothing new about market volatility. Markets have survived viral outbreaks in the past.
Investors who can look past the current environment and stay the course can benefit over the long run.
Rising fears over the continued spread of the coronavirus have led to a sharp stock market decline as investors grapple with its impact on the global economy. On Monday, March 9, in reaction to news of the virus spread and the recent oil shock, Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index fell 7.6%, triggering a 15-minute trading halt. In this interview, Capital Group Chairman and CEO Tim Armour offers his perspective on the latest events and what Capital is doing in portfolios to help guard against market volatility.
What is your sense of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and market reaction?
Until January 2020, most of us had never heard of this virus. In short order, we have grown increasingly concerned about the prospect of a global pandemic and its impact on the global economy. People are understandably frightened because this is a new disease, and there is much uncertainty over how it will all play out. First and foremost, the virus has a real human cost. We don’t know how many people are going to get ill or, worse yet, how many may die. Of course, our first thoughts are with the people who have fallen ill and their families.
While this disease is new, there have been many pandemics and other crises in the past, and markets have survived them all. Today, a fair amount of panic has taken hold around the world, and I expect in the coming weeks that a rising number of cases may alarm many people. As an organization, we have been studying the history of pandemics and the pattern they have tended to follow. There have tended to be hot spots and flare-ups, and they lasted for a while, but then they went away. Eventually, the spread of the virus will slow down and people will get back to normalcy, as will markets.
What does this mean for the economy?
We are already seeing signs of a slowdown in the U.S., not only on the supply side as businesses brace for the road ahead, but also on the demand side. By now we have all heard of large conferences and entertainment events being canceled, firms postponing large meetings, and consumers delaying vacations and seeking to reduce their social contact.
That means businesses related to travel, leisure, entertainment and recreation are likely to be the most impacted, not to mention oil and other commodities where we have already seen a collapse in global demand. A U.S. recession has become increasingly likely. We could see corporate earnings turn negative in the first quarter, which would continue to dampen investor sentiment.
On the positive side, the U.S. economy remains among the most resilient in the world. It has a history of bouncing back from adversity. Interest rates are low, and the decline in oil prices should further support the consumer. What’s more, in China the spread of the virus appears to have peaked. Given that, I think the peak of its spread globally will occur sooner than many people anticipate.
What does it mean for markets?
We are experiencing a market decline that we have not seen since the Global Financial Crisis. As I speak today, March 9 is the 11th anniversary of the market bottom during the Global Financial Crisis — and the market noted the anniversary by recording the largest single-day point decline we have ever seen.
As of the market close on Monday, the broader equity markets, as measured by the S&P 500, were down nearly 19% from their peak earlier in the year, and we may soon be in bear market territory, which is defined by a decline of more than 20%. This would be the first bear market after more than a decade of generally strong market returns. As a result, in general, equities appeared to be fully valued by most measures heading into this recent period, and markets could remain volatile for some time. In addition to the uncertainty resulting from the spread of the virus, the U.S. is in an election year.
Turning to the bond market, we have seen a flight to safety that has pushed bond yields to unprecedented lows. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury fell to 0.5%. Interest rates could go still lower as the U.S. Federal Reserve seeks to provide liquidity to markets through interest rate cuts and quantitative easing. Over time, low interest rates provide support to equities.
While the pace and magnitude of the recent volatility can be unsettling, it is not entirely surprising. Investor sentiment is fragile and will likely remain so until the spread of the virus slows. In times like these, resilient investors who can demonstrate patience can be rewarded over the long term.
I take some comfort in seeing that the Federal Reserve has demonstrated its willingness to take aggressive action, cutting interest rates 50 basis points in an emergency meeting on March 3, which lowered its target range to between 1% and 1.25%. The Fed stated that it is ""closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."" Markets are generally expecting an additional cut at the Fed’s next scheduled meeting, to be held on March 17 and 18.
How does this compare with crises in the past?
In the 37 years I have spent as a professional investor at Capital, I have experienced a number of unsettled markets, including the savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s, the tech and telecom bubble that ended in March 2000, and the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and 2009. Each of these crises was very different, with very different underlying conditions. But in each case, the markets bounced back. I believe the markets, and great companies, will survive the current market decline and rebound.
Let me share with you the words of two of my predecessors who mentored me through periods like this. Jim Fullerton, as Chairman of Capital in 1974 in the depths of one of the worst bear markets we have ever seen, wrote these words that are relevant today:
""One significant reason why there is such an extreme degree of bearishness, pessimism, bewildering confusion and sheer terror in the minds of brokers and investors alike right now is that most people today have nothing in their own experience that they can relate to that is similar to this market decline. My message to you, therefore, is courage! We have been here before. Bear markets have lasted this long before. Well-managed mutual funds have gone down this much before. And shareholders in those funds and the industry survived and prospered.""
And Jim Rothenberg, former Chairman of Capital Group, said this amid the Global Financial Crisis in 2008:
""I have seen many turbulent markets and know how hard it is to avoid getting caught up in the here and now. This is especially true when the media bombards us hourly with news, speculation and rumor. I also know, though, that as long-term investors we must focus on the real world underneath the noise and mesmerizing flow of data.""
Should investors expect a quick recovery?
At this point, I do not think it is realistic to expect a quick recovery. Circumstances may very well get worse before they get better. But I believe eventually markets will rebound. This too shall pass. When it does, long-term investors who can tune out the daily white noise — and red numbers flashing across their screens — and focus on the long term should ultimately be rewarded.
I take the view that we will deal with outbreaks like COVID-19 and eventually we will adjust to it. At Capital, we are taking every precaution to prepare for it. We expect that we will be dealing with COVID-19 for some time, possibly a year or two.
One further point: We have offices in Singapore, Beijing, Hong Kong and Tokyo with a significant number of associates. They have already lived through four weeks of COVID-19. In China, people are already starting to go back to work. If you look at our associates in these offices, they were dealing with an emergency a month ago and today they are returning to a less disruptive life and business environment. They feel things are much more under control. I look at that as a pattern we are likely to experience here in the U.S. and Europe at some point.
What are you doing in your portfolios now to guard against market volatility?
Our company was founded in 1931 in the depths of the Great Depression, with the aim of managing investment mandates designed to do well in volatile market periods. We seek to protect our investors’ capital on the downside, and we invest for the long run. I recently looked at our funds’ results during this admittedly brief period of turmoil. If you look, you will find that many of our U.S. funds have done what we aspire for them to do: They have held up relatively better than their primary benchmarks (as of March 9, 2020).
What is CG doing to ensure continuity as we take care of client assets?
Obviously our first concern is to ensure the health and safety of our associates. We hope the same for investors and advisors. But rest assured as this situation evolves, our more than 350 investment professionals in offices around the world continue to do what they have always done: analyzing companies and making real-time judgements about their potential long-term value. In-depth, fundamental research and a long-term view of markets is at the core of what we do. We will do our very best to provide investors with a smooth and less volatile experience than the broader markets.
What should investors be doing?
In periods of declining markets, emotions run high, and that’s natural and understandable. But it is exactly in times like this that a long-term orientation is important. Based on my prior experiences and what has historically occurred, I firmly believe markets will rebound and life will return to normal. Now more than ever, investors should be in close communication with their advisors, reaffirming their long-term objectives.

Market Volatility
Long-Term Investing
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. Small-company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.

255,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/how-stay-calm-when-markets-stumble.html,4 ways to stay calm when markets stumble,Market Volatility,"March 5, 2020","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Shock events such as the coronavirus outbreak and related stock market volatility can cause investors and 401(k) plan participants to act on their emotions.
Putting a plan in place when markets turn south — and reviewing that plan when emotions are running high — can temper this impulse.
The current market volatility gives investors, advisors and plan sponsors a golden opportunity to talk about what to do — or not do — if there is a sustained downturn.
In the eyes of veteran financial advisor Tim McCabe, there is no better time to talk about market shocks than right here, right now.
So on February 28, just as news media were reporting the spread of the coronavirus to Italy and South Korea — and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index was finishing a seven-day slide of more than 12% — McCabe and a colleague met with a young client to discuss his investments, the news of the day and the related market volatility.
This client, who had just begun investing a few years ago and had never experienced a significant market downturn, was visibly uneasy. “I addressed the troubling news head-on,” recalls McCabe, owner and principal of McCabe & Associates outside Chicago. “I emphasized that I cannot tell him how the coronavirus will impact the market or economy because I don’t think anybody knows.”
Instead, McCabe encouraged his client to focus on the long-term plan they had developed, and then he took some time to offer historical perspective. “I told him that Covid-19 may be new, but market volatility is not,” says McCabe. “And that patient investors who stay the course have tended to do better over time.”
He shared data confirming that market downturns are inevitable but that markets have bounced back from crises in the past. Indeed, market corrections (a decline of 10% or more) have happened about once every year, according to S&P 500 data from 1950 to 2019.
“But facts alone won’t work,” says McCabe. “You’ve got to acknowledge their feelings too.” It didn’t hurt that this particular investor was the son of a client McCabe had been working with since the 1980s. “I was able to drive the point home by sharing some experiences I had with his father through market cycles.”
No doubt, conversations like this are taking place all over the country. Here are four key steps that you can take to counteract market volatility and act as an antidote to the breathless media coverage of the coronavirus’s spread.
1. Keep the conversation going — in good times and bad
First and foremost, don’t wait for a bear market or a full-blown economic crisis to get the conversation going. Reaching out in both good times and bad to acknowledge the inevitability of market shocks can help temper emotions.
McCabe’s firm keeps the conversation going by regularly posting articles to the firm’s website. “We use it to provide updates about market developments,” McCabe says. “We have enhanced it over the years, and it has been a useful tool to keep in regular contact with investors.”
Similarly, McCabe’s firm— which also works with qualified retirement plans — provides plan sponsors with timely articles and information they can distribute to employees. “We try to keep these communications simple and straightforward, because many plan participants typically don’t spend much time reviewing their 401(k) investments,” he says. “We use times like these to remind plan participants of the potential benefits of using target date funds, which relieves the participant of the burden of rebalancing their portfolios, something that is critical after a year like 2019 when stocks far outpaced bonds.”
As often as possible, advisors should reinforce the notion that the journey will inevitably be bumpy. When equities first began their February swoon, Brian Jones, chairman at CJM Wealth Advisers in Fairfax, Virginia, like many other advisors, sent emails to clients to acknowledge the market losses and offer a bit of perspective on the plunging red arrows they saw flashing on television.
“It is important not to give in to the temptation to make sudden moves during market downturns,” CJM said in a recent note to clients. “Your broadly diversified portfolios are designed to participate in the gains when the market is rising and to minimize, as much as possible, the declines when markets sell off.”
2. Revisit your long-term plan
Having a long-term investment plan conceived during more benign times and revisiting that plan when markets tumble can help investors keep their emotions in check. “Every year we schedule reallocation discussions with clients,” notes McCabe. “When we do, we ask if their goals have changed. If not, we strongly advise them to stick with the long-term plan we developed together.”
Planning for a rainy day helps investors stay calm says Suresh Raghavan, a registered investment advisor (RIA) and principal at MBR Financial in Houston. Raghavan works with clients to create an estimate of monthly living expenses and then puts enough away in cash or cash equivalents to cover 18 months’ worth of those bills.
Even if the client doesn’t have to dip into these funds, just knowing they’re there can help calm frazzled nerves. “My partners wish I wouldn’t call it this, but I call it the ‘blankie’ portfolio: It’s to help you sleep well at night,” Raghavan says.
3. Place current events in historical perspective
Keeping a long-term perspective is always important, but it’s essential when markets are stormy and emotions running high. A look at history shows that while markets react to news events in the short term, they have tended to reward patient investors over long periods of time.
Indeed, global markets have shrugged off the impact of past viral outbreaks. While the past is not predictive of the future, it does offer valuable perspective.
“History may not repeat, but it does rhyme,” notes McCabe. “There is nothing exactly like the coronavirus. We don’t really know how this is going to play out. But you can compare it to SARS to help put things in perspective. What have we seen in the past that may help us look at current conditions more rationally?”
No one knows how long or how far the coronavirus will spread, but here is a brief look at how three recent infectious outbreaks unfolded:
2003 — SARS saw 8,000 people infected. It was brought to an end by good hygiene (hand-washing) and environmental factors (warming temperatures), and it burnt out when enough people became infected to build an immunity to the disease.
2009 — H1N1 Flu caused a pandemic in ‘09 and has become a seasonal flu, usually recurring in the colder months.
2014 — Ebola in West Africa ended with human intervention, when the WHO declared a coordinated international response. Countries worked together to administer to the sick, and when a second outbreak occurred in 2018, human intervention made the difference again when treatments developed from the first outbreak were offered to patients.
4. Acknowledge the power of emotions
At the end of the day, we are all emotional beings. A key finding of behavioral economists is that people often act irrationally when making investment choices. “Individuals deal with money very viscerally,” notes Raghavan. So naturally they will expect their advisors to respond with more than just historical market data.
The key is to put current activity into the context of the bigger picture and to acknowledge that biases can affect investor thinking. These factors may lead investors to believe that markets are doing worse or better than impartial analysis would reveal:
Confirmation bias: Giving more weight to trends you already believe in
Availability bias: Giving more weight to recent events
Framing effect: Letting the presentation of information affect your interpretation of it
A good advisor should acknowledge investors’ fears, Raghavan says, but remind them that there are “always going to be things we don’t know, things we can’t predict.”
Like McCabe, Raghavan says he’s generally been able to rely on his three decades of experience to help reassure jittery investors. “When you’re flying in a plane and there’s turbulence, what should you do?” Raghavan asks.
The last thing passengers should do is to try to fly the plane themselves, he adds. “Clearly, you want to make sure the plan is appropriate for the situation,” he says. “But allow the professional to do what the professional does,” and guide that investor through the storm.

256,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/coronavirus-major-economies.html,"Coronavirus: Our economists weigh in on the U.S., China and Europe",Market Volatility,"March 4, 2020","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
The U.S. economy is best positioned to weather a coronavirus storm.
Fed rate cut shows the central bank is committed to a path of aggressive monetary stimulus.
China and Europe likely face a difficult road ahead amid supply-chain disruptions.
Investors should consider staying the course until markets settle and the outlook is more certain.
The spread of the coronavirus outside of China to a broader swath of countries in Asia and Europe is fueling a broad re-examination of 2020 global economic growth assumptions. Even with Tuesday’s 50-basis-point rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, our economists say the global economy is headed for a significant slowdown at least in the first half of the year. 
The depth and severity of any downturn will depend on how policymakers in the U.S., Europe and China respond, both to the spread of the virus and to changes in the macroeconomic environment. As these events unfold, investors should consider staying the course. Timing the markets can be inherently risky.
Here’s how our economists are assessing conditions in the U.S., Europe and China:
The U.S. remains the most resilient of the world’s major economies
Jared Franz, Capital Group economist in Los Angeles
Among the world’s largest economies, the U.S. remains the most resilient. The U.S. economy had been growing above trend with a solid labor market. Industrial sector activity was starting to pick up as détente was reached in the trade war and the General Motors strike ended.
The Fed’s surprise announcement on Tuesday was the first between-meeting rate cut since the 2008—09 financial crisis and clearly shows that the central bank is taking the coronavirus outbreak, and its potential impact on the economy, very seriously. After the announcement, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined to a new record low, falling below 1% for the first time.
The challenge is that stock markets previously had priced in a goldilocks scenario and entered the year with an elevated price-to-earnings multiple of around 18, providing little cushion. On top of that, in contrast to the consumer, a large part of the corporate sector is burdened by high debt relative to its equity, or high leverage. Earnings expectations for 2020 for companies in the S&P 500 were already muted and have come down further given potential supply disruptions. Amid these challenges, the stock market fell more than 12% over the last seven trading days of February.
Based on the current tightening in financial conditions, I expect the Fed to continue on a path of monetary easing. But it’s important to note that central bank policy has limited influence in an economy potentially hurt by both a demand and supply shock.
If the virus spreads further and dampens economic activity, it could easily shave off one percentage point from my base case annualized GDP growth expectation of 2.0%. And if a negative feedback loop persists, I cannot rule out a recession, although that is not my base case scenario. If the situation comes under control relatively quickly, we could see a pickup in activity in the second half of the year.
Around the world, the dilemma for central bankers is that the coronavirus poses as much of a negative supply shock as a demand shock. Monetary policy can influence demand, less so the supply side. Plus, with already low rates in the U.S. and negative rates throughout Europe, there is a severe shortage of policy ammunition.
Central banks can accelerate quantitative easing programs, but that generally has a more limited impact than cutting interest rates. This means governments will also consider fiscal expansion to counter the effects of the virus.
Nonetheless, some of the economic damage has already occurred. China’s factories have remained closed for several weeks and are unlikely to quickly become fully functional.
In addition to manufacturing, an equally important economic impact may lie on the services side. On the manufacturing front, companies can catch up when things return to normal: firms ramp up production and rebuild inventories, producing a bounce-back recovery. But on the services side, lost GDP is not often recovered, whether it is the vacation that was not taken or the restaurant meal that was not had. This is why it is much more difficult to estimate the impact of the virus as compared to, say, a natural disaster.
Brace for broad slowdown in China’s economy
Stephen Green, Capital Group economist in Hong Kong
With China now making up almost 20% of global gross domestic product, China’s slowdown from this outbreak will probably have broader impacts than the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003. We know for the past month that most people in China have stayed at home and haven’t returned to factories or offices. I believe that China’s economy, which was already growing at the slowest pace in 30 years before the outbreak, will experience negative growth in the first quarter, and a mild growth recovery is likely in the last six months of this year.
When we’ve pressed our industry contacts about the timing of workers returning to manufacturing plants and offices, we have heard that mid-March is a possibility. But analyzing the situation on the ground, I don’t think the Chinese economy will normalize until April at the earliest.
Factory operators must get permission from local government to reopen, and health inspections have to be done. Many cities and industrial zones can require 15 certificates to operate. Factories need enough material on hand to make the product and workers have to be back at full capacity. Once the goods are produced, ships have to be at the port. Once you’ve produced the goods, they need to get to port and then to their end destination.
In early signs of a slowdown, the February factory PMI fell to a record low of 35.7 — compared with a market-consensus estimate of 46. The non-manufacturing PMI fell even more significantly, down 24.5 points to a record low of 29.6 in February, reflecting the scare factor and disruptions in transportation, suggesting a broad-based contraction in the economy.
Compared with other countries, Chinese party leaders have a wider arsenal of tools at their disposal to stimulate the economy.
For example, they could cut benchmark interest rates by 200 basis points and still be well above zero. They can also provide fiscal stimulus as the country’s deficit is below 5% of GDP. Financing infrastructure projects such as bridges, tunnels and subway lines through bond issuance is an option. Recently, many cities have begun to decrease the percentage of money needed for a down payment to buy an apartment. And the government has told banks to extend loan repayments coming due for small- and medium-sized businesses.
How effective any of these tools will be depends to a large extent on whether workers feel safe enough to return and confident enough about their prospects of buying an apartment.
European economy likely to slow further
Robert Lind, Capital Group economist in London
With major European economies growing only marginally before the outbreak, it is increasingly likely that the widening epidemic could push the eurozone into a recession in early 2020. The risk is most evident in Italy where more than 2,000 infections have been reported, as of March 3. If the virus spreads further, it could deliver a significant shock to one of the eurozone’s weakest economies. A sharp downturn in Italy would inevitably feed into the rest of Europe, weakening the entire region in the process.
Beyond that, Europe has significant exposure to China’s economy. Falling demand from China, coupled with a breakdown in supply chains, would hit the European economy — with Germany and the U.K. exposed to weaker demand for goods, and France vulnerable to weaker tourism. Luxury goods, electronics and autos would be among the most negatively impacted industries.
In 2019, the eurozone economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.2%. At such a low level, it doesn’t take much pressure for economic growth to go flat or negative. Before the outbreak, Europe was showing tentative signs of recovery from a protracted industrial slowdown.
Given recent events, European Central Bank officials will probably feel the need to do something in the face of a widening outbreak. ECB officials are increasingly conscious of the impact of negative interest rates on the banking sector, which might deter them from lowering the deposit rate. But they may decide to increase their bond-buying stimulus program from a current level of €20 billion a month to something in the range of €25 billion to €30 billion a month.
In this environment, there also will be greater pressure for a fiscal response from governments. In the event of a serious downturn, I’d expect more aggressive fiscal easing, including tax cuts and higher government spending.

China likely to see flat to negative growth with disruption from coronavirus
The global economy will likely suffer from China’s impact
Investors should brace for continued market volatility
Global stocks have fallen sharply following confirmation that the coronavirus has spread to Italy, South Korea and Iran, raising fresh questions about the potential impact on global economic growth and business sector supply chains dependent on China.
After reaching a record high on February 17, the S&P 500 Composite Index has declined by 12%, as of February 27, suffering its first market correction since 2018.
A rising number of infections in Europe, in particular, has prompted markets to re-evaluate concerns about a global pandemic, even though the number of reported cases in mainland China has declined since news reports about the outbreak accelerated around January 17.
“Until this week, the consensus market view of the coronavirus has been fairly benign, but now as it spreads beyond Asia, investors are clearly taking it more seriously,” says Capital Group portfolio manager Jody Jonsson. “The market is starting to consider what it means for global trade and travel. The market is worried about recessionary conditions in certain areas, including China, Japan and potentially Europe.”  
Is supply chain impact fully priced in?
Given China’s stature as the world’s No. 2 economy, one of the most difficult questions that markets are grappling with is the possible impact on global supply chains, and the corresponding effect on multinationals and economic activity in other countries.
For instance, what happens if China cannot send the intermediate products needed in the U.S. or South Korea or Japan to assemble finished goods? Are there enough truck drivers to move products, and do the ports have enough containers available?
“We know for the past month that most people in China have stayed at home and haven’t returned to factories or offices. I believe China’s economy will experience negative growth in the first quarter, and then it’s just a question of how quickly the country can get back to work,” says Stephen Green, a Capital Group economist based in Hong Kong.
“When we’ve pressed our industry contacts about the timing of workers returning to manufacturing plants and offices, we have heard mid-March,” Green adds. “That is the base case. But I believe that hinges on the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in China continuing to come down and people gaining more confidence in those numbers and returning to work.”
Even then, there are logistical challenges.
Factory operators have to get permission from the local government to reopen, and health inspections have to be done. Many cities and industrial zones can require 15 certificates. Is enough material on hand to make the product and are there enough workers to run the plant at full capacity? Once you’ve produced the product, is there a truck driver to get it to the port and are there workers at the port to load the goods on a ship? All of these questions are incredibly hard to solve at this time.
“So, in my view, I don’t think the Chinese economy will normalize until April at the earliest,” says Green.
Apple, which relies heavily on manufacturing plants in China, is the most prominent example yet of the broad ripple effects of the coronavirus on global business. The iPhone maker warned February 17 that its revenue for the current quarter would fall short of estimates.
Capital Group U.S. economist Jared Franz says that his early research this week shows that computers, electronic equipment and industrial machinery are the three industries most vulnerable to supply chain disruptions from China.
Global investment implications
This poses a potential threat to Europe’s fragile industrial recovery, with Germany the most exposed through trade links. Meanwhile, France and Italy also have significant exposure to China through tourism, services and luxury goods. And Japan, on the brink of another recession, is heavily dependent on China for intermediate goods that go into its manufacturing.
The complexity and timing of this outbreak may make resumption of normal growth more halting and unpredictable. Global supply chains are tighter and more dependent on China than when the SARS outbreak hit the country in 2002 and 2003.
With China now making up almost 20% of global gross domestic product, China’s slowdown from this outbreak will probably have broader impacts than the SARS outbreak. 
While the U.S. economy began 2020 in a much stronger position relative to the rest of the world — with very low unemployment, a robust housing market and a confident consumer — it is not immune to China’s slowdown and supply chain problems.
“If the virus spreads further and China’s manufacturing base in not fully functional by April or May at the latest, we could shave half a percentage point from U.S. GDP in the first half of the year,” Franz adds. “And if it lasts longer, the impact could be more severe in the second.”
Leading Chinese officials have said getting the country’s economy up and running again at full strength is a top priority. They have expressed that the coronavirus is a temporary setback to economic growth. So far, stimulus measures from Beijing have included interest rate cuts, more liquidity for small- and medium-sized enterprises and postponement of debt collections.
The virus is taking its toll on business across the world.
Many U.S.-based airlines have canceled flights to the country. And some companies are lowering earnings guidance for 2020, including some of the world’s biggest cruise line operators and consumer goods makers.
Some companies are opting out of planned conferences in places such as San Francisco and New York as fear of the virus spreads.
“In some ways, the impact is greater on certain companies outside of China — obviously, airlines and cruise companies fall into that category,” says Jonsson. “But it’s also providing a boost to some industries, especially e-commerce and gaming companies. As more people stay home, you’re seeing massive increases in the consumption of home entertainment and online shopping activities.”
This is certainly the case for Chinese technology giant Tencent, which operates one of the world’s largest mobile video game and social media platforms.
Adds Jonsson, “There are a number of industries where I've decided to wait and see how this plays out. For example, when it comes to luxury goods companies or travel-related companies, I think we have time to observe how widespread this situation becomes before making any big decisions in those areas.”

258,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/3-investor-mistakes-election-year.html,3 mistakes investors make during election years,Election,"February 19, 2020","Investing during an election year can be tough on the nerves, and 2020 promises to be no different. Politics can bring out strong emotions and biases, but investors would be wise to put these aside when making investment decisions.
Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, famously noted that “In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” He wasn’t literally referring to the intersection of elections and investing, but he could have been. Markets can be especially choppy during election years, with sentiment often changing as quickly as candidates open their mouths.
Graham first made his analogy in 1934, in his seminal book, “Security Analysis.” Since then there have been 22 election cycles, and we’ve analyzed them all to help you and your clients prepare for investing in these potentially volatile periods. Below we highlight three common mistakes made by investors in election years and offer ways to avoid these pitfalls and invest with confidence in 2020.
Mistake 1: Investors worry too much about which party wins the election
There’s nothing wrong with wanting your candidate to win, but investors can run into trouble when they place too much importance on election results. That’s because elections have, historically speaking, made essentially no difference when it comes to long-term investment returns.
“Presidents get far too much credit, and far too much blame, for the health of the U.S. economy and the state of the financial markets,” says Capital Group economist Darrell Spence. “There are many other variables that determine economic growth and market returns and, frankly, presidents have very little influence over them.”
What should matter more to investors is staying invested. Although past results are not predictive of future returns, a $1,000 investment in the S&P 500 made when Franklin D. Roosevelt took office would have been worth over $14 million today. During this time there have been exactly seven Democratic and seven Republican presidents. Getting out of the market to avoid a certain party or candidate in office could have severely detracted from an investor’s long-term returns.
By design, elections have clear winners and losers. But the real winners were investors who avoided the temptation to base their decisions around election results and stayed invested for the long haul.
Mistake 2: Investors get spooked by primary season volatility
Markets hate uncertainty, and what’s more uncertain than primary season of an election year? With so many candidates on the campaign trail — 11 Democrats were still running when primaries kicked off in early February — the range of outcomes can feel daunting.
But volatility caused by this uncertainty is often short-lived. After the primaries are over and each party has selected its candidate, markets have tended to return to their normal upward trajectory.
Election year volatility can also bring select buying opportunities. Policy proposals during primaries often target specific industries, putting pressure on share prices. This cycle, it’s the health care sector that’s in the spotlight as several candidates have proposed overhauls to drug pricing and the health care system.
Does that mean you should avoid this sector altogether? Not according to Rob Lovelace, an equity portfolio manager with 34 years of experience investing through many election cycles. “When everyone is worried that a new government policy is going to come along and destroy a sector, that concern is usually overblown,” Lovelace says. “Companies with good drugs that are really helping people will be able to get into the market, and they will get paid for it.”
In the past, those targeted sectors have often rallied after the campaign spotlight dimmed. It happened with health care following the 2016 presidential and 2018 midterm elections, and has happened with other sectors in the past. This can create buying opportunities for investors with a contrarian point of view and the ability to withstand short-term volatility.
Mistake 3: Investors try to time the markets around politics
If you’re nervous about the markets in 2020, you’re not alone. Presidential candidates often draw attention to the country’s problems, and campaigns regularly amplify negative messages. So maybe it should be no surprise that investors have tended to be more conservative with their portfolios ahead of elections.
Since 1992, investors have poured assets into money market funds — traditionally one of the lowest risk investment vehicles — much more often leading up to elections. By contrast, equity funds have seen the highest net inflows in the year immediately after an election. This suggests that investors may prefer to minimize risk during election years and wait until after uncertainty has subsided to revisit riskier assets like stocks. 
But market timing is rarely a winning long-term investment strategy, and it can pose a major problem for portfolio returns. To verify this, we analyzed investment returns over the last 22 election cycles to compare three hypothetical investment approaches: being fully invested in equities, making monthly contributions to equities, or staying in cash until after the election. We then calculated the portfolio returns after each cycle, assuming a four-year holding period.
The hypothetical investor who stayed in cash until after the election had the worst outcome of the three portfolios in 16 of 22 periods. Meanwhile, investors who were fully invested or made monthly contributions during election years came out on top. These investors had higher average portfolio balances over the full period and more often outpaced the investor who stayed on the sidelines longer. (For more information on the methodology of this analysis, please refer to the notes section at the end of this article or the full Guide to investing in an election year.)
Sticking with a sound long-term investment plan based on individual investment objectives is usually the best course of action. Whether that strategy is to be fully invested throughout the year or to consistently invest through a vehicle such as a 401(k) plan, the bottom line is that investors should avoid market timing around politics. As is often the case with investing, the key is to put aside short-term noise and focus on long-term goals.
How can investors avoid these mistakes?
Don’t allow election predictions and outcomes to influence investment decisions. History shows that election results have very little impact on long-term returns.
Expect volatility, especially during primary season, but don’t fear it. View it as a potential opportunity.
Stick to a long-term investment strategy instead of trying to time markets around elections. Investors who were fully invested or made regular, monthly investments did better than those who stayed in cash in election years.

The coronavirus outbreak will likely stunt global economic growth in the near term.
Our economists expect a V-shaped rebound in the second half of the year.
As with past outbreaks, markets are expected to power through it over the long term.
As Chinese authorities deal with a rapidly spreading coronavirus, investors are raising questions about the potential impact on global economic growth and the financial markets. While much is still unknown about the extent of the outbreak — and, crucially, how long it may last — the initial drag on China and other emerging markets is starting to come into focus.
China’s economy was already growing at the slowest rate in 30 years before reports of the outbreak first emerged in the central China city of Wuhan. Since then, the Chinese government has placed a dozen cities under quarantine, shut down businesses and schools, and restricted travel in the affected regions. More than 60,200 infections have been reported as of February 13, including a small number in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia.
To get a handle on how the outbreak is affecting global economic conditions, we talked to two Capital Group investment veterans who are based in Hong Kong, as well as one of our U.S. economists. Here’s a look at their perspectives:
“Given the quarantine lockdowns, it’s highly likely that the numbers of infected people in mainland China are significantly underestimated,” says Stephen Green, a Capital Group economist based in Hong Kong, “especially in rural areas where medical facilities are limited.
“Depending on how long it takes to contain the coronavirus, we should expect to see sizable declines in consumer spending and manufacturing activity at least through the end of February,” Green adds. “I wouldn’t be surprised if China’s first-quarter GDP growth falls below 6% and some Wall Street estimates are as low as 5%, which is certainly in the realm of possibility.”
Global slowdown
Outside China, the biggest economic impact is expected be in Thailand, which relies heavily on Chinese tourism. Among industries, travel and tourism throughout Asia will likely take a significant hit, Green explains, along with sales of luxury goods. In addition, many events associated with China’s lunar new year have been canceled. Energy stocks also have fallen sharply as investors expect oil prices to decline further amid lower demand from China.
Since news reports about the virus accelerated around January 17, emerging markets stocks have declined by about 4%, as measured by the MSCI Emerging Markets IMI. Chinese stocks are down more than 6% and Thai stocks slipped 7%. By comparison, the MSCI World Index declined 1.3% during the period through January 29.
If the economy and markets continue to deteriorate, Green notes, Chinese authorities are likely to launch new stimulus measures, including potential tax cuts and interest rate cuts.
What about the U.S.?
U.S. stocks, meanwhile, have lost about 2% on worries that the outbreak could have a spillover effect on the U.S. economy, including American companies that do business in China. Starbucks has closed about half of its 4,300 stores in China. Many U.S.-based airlines are also canceling flights to the country. And there are growing concerns about supply-chain disruptions for companies such as Apple that have significant manufacturing operations there.
Coupled with Boeing’s recent troubles returning the 737 Max jet to service, the outlook for the U.S. economy now looks more uncertain than it did just a few weeks ago, says Capital Group U.S. economist Jared Franz. Fourth-quarter U.S. GDP growth came in at 2.1% on an annualized basis, according to Commerce Department figures released on Thursday.
“If 737 Max production remains grounded through July, then I estimate the impact on first-half GDP growth will be roughly –0.5 percentage points,” Franz says. “The economic impact of the coronavirus on the U.S. is more difficult to calibrate, but I expect it to be modest and mostly felt through trade disruption and financial linkages.”
Assuming the outbreak is contained soon, Franz said it’s likely global economic growth will experience a V-shaped recovery characterized by slower growth in the first half and a significant acceleration in the second half of the year. The U.S. economy will probably follow the same course.
“U.S. economic fundamentals remain sound, labor markets are resilient and the Federal Reserve stands ready to take action as needed,” Franz adds. “The coronavirus looks to be a modest but temporary restraint on U.S. economic activity via secondary channels of impact, but should not derail my growth expectations of roughly 2% in 2020.”
SARS comparison
That’s similar to the pattern shown after the SARS outbreak that hit China in 2002 and 2003. Key indicators bounced back quickly after the virus was contained. Many investors are looking at the SARS event as a template for what might happen in the weeks and months ahead — although it’s important to note that there were many other factors during that time period, including the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.
In addition, the structure of the global economy was significantly different. The Chinese economy was largely investment-driven at that time. Consumer spending is a much larger percentage of total economic output today. Travel and tourism activity also was much lower than it is now, with Chinese tourism skyrocketing over the past decade.
Investment implications
That said, market psychology is often highly predictable during times of crisis as investors tend to overreact to distressing news, says Steve Watson, a Capital Group portfolio manager based in Hong Kong.
“The situation today is very reminiscent of SARS, which we lived through here in Hong Kong 17 years ago,” Watson explains. “The uncertainty was extremely high during the SARS outbreak and it was certainly a difficult time for many people, but once it was over, the following relief rally was powerful.”
As with any large-scale crisis, long-term investors should look for select opportunities that may be generated by a near-term loss of confidence, Watson says. “This is when long-term thinking, on-the-ground research and a focus on value can make a meaningful difference.”

260,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/5g-revolution.html,5G wireless evolution: Can you hear me now?,Technology & Innovation,"February 12, 2020","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
The emergence of 5G wireless technology heralds a new era in communications.
Faster data transmission speeds could transform industries, including health care, robotics and driverless cars.
The largest benefits of 5G may come from technological innovations that are just sketches on a drawing board today.
If measured solely by the pizzazz of its name, 5G doesn’t exactly set hearts aflutter. It lacks the futuristic allure of, say, artificial intelligence or machine learning. And it doesn’t conjure images of science fiction springing to life in the same vein as self-driving cars, advanced robotics or wearable electronics.
But what 5G lacks in public relations appeal, it makes up for in sheer transformational potential. This fifth generation of wireless communication is projected to be as much as 100 times faster than the current 4G, with seamless connections that promise relief for cellphone users plagued by dropped calls or interminable waits to log into websites.
In fact, 5G is an essential ingredient underpinning many of tomorrow’s most prominent technologies. Robots, for example, can only perform the intricate tasks envisioned for the future if they can wirelessly synchronize with one another in real time.
The most far-reaching benefits of 5G might not come from what’s expected but from applications that are little more than sketches on a drawing board today. That was the case with 4G when it was rolled out nearly a decade ago. 4G made good on its promise of speed and connectivity. But beyond that, it provided the technological scaffolding that set the stage for today’s sprawling ecosystem of smartphone apps: streaming video and music, social networking and portable gaming.
The high stakes involved in 5G are reflected in fierce competition between the U.S. and China. As part of their larger clash over trade and technology, the world’s two biggest economies are squaring off in a sprint for 5G superiority, believing it will provide a gateway to broader economic and digital primacy. Indeed, if 4G is any guide, the country that best implements 5G stands to reap significant financial rewards.
5G is the digital promised land
Of course, none of this will happen immediately. Despite breathless marketing campaigns from smartphone makers and cell service providers, it will take time to work through the normal growing pains that accompany a rollout this grand in scale and ambition. Technological standards must be ironed out, logistical hurdles must be overcome and major infrastructure investments must be made.
Still, there’s a lot to be excited about, both for the companies providing the components and services, and for consumers thirsting for a digital promised land of blazing speed and nearly instantaneous reaction times. In coming years, 5G is likely to uncork some of the current 4G bottlenecks, lay the foundation for coming innovations and, ultimately, usher in a new era of communications.
Reducing latency is a wireless game changer
Every generation of cellular network has improved on the one it preceded. The second generation added digital capabilities, allowing phones to send text messages and, eventually, photos. The third made those systems swifter and more reliable. The fourth added bandwidth by converting nearly all cell networks to digital streams.
Where 5G shines is in its ability to reduce latency — the time lag it takes two machines to communicate with one another. Think of when you dial a friend on your smartphone and wait through a moment of silence before the other phone rings. That moment is travel time; your request must reach the other device and be processed, and the response must arc back to your phone.
Latency is measured in milliseconds, or thousandths of a second, and though that doesn’t sound like much, it’s a major roadblock to time-sensitive actions. Imagine driving down the street and seeing another car darting into an intersection. You slam on the brakes to avoid a collision. That might feel like a single action, but it’s actually a multistep process. For most drivers, it takes about 1,500 milliseconds, or a second and a half.
5G answers the need for speed
For most 4G networks, it takes about 50 milliseconds to carry your request one way; 5G networks have the potential to get to a reliable 1 millisecond. Again, that might not sound like much, but shaving that from your reaction time at highway speed would allow you to brake about 10 feet earlier. And if your car is driving itself, every inch matters.
Such time savings are even more valuable in systems that make hundreds or thousands of server requests a minute, especially those in which the speed of one function depends on that of another. On an assembly line, for example, a robot can’t go faster than the one preceding it. Latency also limits multitasking or switching between jobs. High latency adds time to each step, making some tasks too inefficient to justify.
Many sectors could benefit from 5G
Self-driving cars head the list of industries that are expected to reap the benefits of 5G. Ultrafast communications will give vehicles more time to react to surprises and broadcast warnings to others. Think back to the car in the intersection. For autonomous vehicles, a 2 millisecond call to central control, followed by a 1 millisecond warning to every nearby car, could prevent a crash.
Industrial robotics could also get a huge boost, as automated machines would be able to execute more complicated tasks. Robots would be better equipped to handle multiple tasks. Beyond that, 5G may let factories operate robots without cumbersome wires. And machines with lightning-fast reflexes could minimize factory floor injuries by identifying and avoiding their human counterparts.
The emergence of 5G could have profound effects on health care. For instance, it could speed the use of robotic surgery, allowing doctors to remotely control devices without any delay or loss in fidelity. This could allow a specialist in one part of the world to operate on a patient in another.
And as network-connected devices become more common — think internet-enabled refrigerators and GPS-equipped dog collars — households are likely to place a much higher load on the network. Lower latency and greater bandwidth will serve to make the “internet of things” more manageable.
Global race is on for 5G supremacy
The ultimate impact of 5G could extend beyond the merely technical. If past is prelude, successful adoption could add oomph to entire economies, as the U.S. experienced with 4G. By modernizing its creaky 3G system, the U.S. created a fertile environment for domestic technology companies to develop new ways of storing and transmitting content. And robust public access ensured there was an audience to consume that content. Investors benefited greatly as Facebook, Netflix and Alphabet (parent of Google and YouTube) fortified their market-leading positions.
A feverish race is now on for 5G dominance. China has long sought to establish itself as a major player in cellular networking, both by helping to develop system protocols and nurturing its own hardware producers. One of these, Huawei, is among the largest producers of networking hardware, though it’s effectively been banned from U.S. markets because of concerns that its devices could provide sensitive data to the Chinese government.
As part of its strategy, China siloed its internet and developed its own search engine, social media and e-commerce titans: Baidu instead of Google, WeChat instead of Facebook, Alibaba instead of Amazon. It now has its own highly developed internet ecosystem. That’s placed China in a strong position to reap the benefits of 5G — and perhaps position some of its companies as global leaders.
The scramble for 5G primacy is sure to create opportunities for long-term investors. Businesses that churn out cutting-edge technology, as well as those harnessing it to roll out new or improved products, have the potential to stand out in the global marketplace. Once 5G becomes widely available, it will open business models that didn’t previously exist due to technological limitations. It will also boost the current tech giants as internet search, social media and e-commerce become further ingrained in daily life.
Though it’s hard to fully predict what the 5G world will look like, a new era of technological innovation is on the horizon.

261,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/top-investing-questions-answers.html,Your top 6 investing questions for 2020 answered,Asset Allocation,"February 5, 2020","There’s no such thing as a bad question. Especially in a year like 2020 when investors are feeling nervous about the macroeconomic and political crosswinds blowing across the investment landscape.
To find out what questions were on your mind, we polled thousands of advisors who attended Capital Group’s 2020 Outlook webinar. The following six questions were among the most frequently asked. Here’s how our investment team answered:
1. Should I get out of the market during this election year?
U.S. presidential elections have always been contentious affairs. As we get closer to November’s general election, investors can expect divisive political news to increasingly dominate the headlines, unsettling markets. That’s likely to be particularly true this year during a hotly contested Democratic primary season, which officially kicked off February 3 in Iowa.
Investors may be tempted to sit on the sidelines until the smoke clears. Indeed, during previous election cycles investors appear to have done just that, rotating money into money market funds during election years, then moving back into stock funds the following year.
But is this a winning strategy? History suggests otherwise. In past election years, markets have tended to return to an upward trajectory after primary season. Stocks, as measured by Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Index, have had negative returns in only two of the last 20 election years (2000 and 2008), and both declines were largely attributed to asset price bubbles, not politics.
“Presidents get far too much credit, and far too much blame, for the health of the U.S. economy and the state of the financial markets,” says Capital Group economist Darrell Spence. “There are many other variables that determine economic growth and market returns and, frankly, presidents have very little influence over them.”
Bottom line: Investors who look past primary season volatility and maintain a long-term focus can succeed regardless of the election outcome. 
2. Will there be a recession in 2020?
It’s a question that has been on investors’ minds for years now, and for good reason: Recessions can be painful. In 2019, the various twists and turns of the U.S.-China trade war and a buildup in inventories led to a manufacturing slowdown in the U.S., triggering concerns about an imminent recession.
“We have seen a tale of two economies in the U.S.: a weak industrial sector but a reasonably healthy domestic economy, thanks largely to a resilient U.S. consumer sector,” Spence adds.
The manufacturing slowdown and trade war captured the attention of policymakers as well as investors. The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times in 2019, and major central banks around the world have taken similarly aggressive action to maintain easy monetary policy.
“It takes a while for monetary policy to have an impact,” Spence explains. “But we are already starting to see some positive signs with a pickup in the housing market. Given the low-rate environment and the health of the U.S. consumer, I believe we are going to see a reacceleration in the economy in 2020, barring some unexpected shock.”
Bottom line: Although recessions are notoriously difficult to predict, easy monetary policy and a strong consumer should keep the U.S. economy on a growth path in 2020.
3. Why should I bother investing in international markets?
For more than a decade the U.S. stock market has outpaced international equity markets by a wide margin, raising persistent questions about whether it still makes sense to invest in Europe, Japan and other non-U.S. markets. However, it’s more important than ever to take a global view of investing, says equity portfolio manager Rob Lovelace.
“Investors should really be thinking of the world as one market today,” Lovelace says. “Where a company gets its mail is no longer a good proxy for where it does business. For example, many European companies are conducting much of their business in the U.S. or China. So it’s important to closely look at where companies generate revenue.”
With the recent dominance of the U.S. market, a look at indexes suggests that non-U.S. stocks offer more favorable risk-return potential than domestic stocks. To be sure, indexes don’t paint a full picture, as differences in return can be distorted by differences in index composition.
Consider that international indexes are often heavily weighted toward companies in the financials and materials sectors, while U.S. indexes are weighted more toward fast-growing technology and health care companies. What’s more, a close look at individual companies reveals that over the last decade those with the best returns were overwhelmingly domiciled outside the U.S.
“I am finding as many or more opportunities outside the U.S. than in the U.S., even though I think overall the U.S. market will be one of the best markets going forward,” explains Lovelace, a portfolio manager for New Perspective Fund®. “That’s why I believe it is so important for investors to change their mindset.”
Bottom line: Many of the best-performing stocks are outside the U.S. each year, so it’s important to stay globally diversified.
4. How will the trade war affect my investments?
The global trade picture improved somewhat at the start of the year. In January the U.S. and China signed a “phase one” trade agreement in which China agreed to buy more U.S. goods and the U.S. agreed to lighten some tariffs on Chinese goods. “Clearly this is a step in the right direction,” says equity portfolio manager Jody Jonsson, who focuses on large, multinational companies for New Perspective Fund. “But we have a long way to go.”
Ironing out more complicated issues such as intellectual property rights, for example, could take many years to resolve. Investors may be growing concerned that a backslide in negotiations or a further deterioration of the global trade landscape could place multinational businesses in jeopardy. “To the contrary, I believe well-managed multinational companies will be able to navigate treacherous waters and succeed regardless of geopolitical headwinds,” notes Jonsson.
In the last 15 years businesses operating in markets around the world have multiplied and thrived, outpacing the broader equity market while adapting to an ever-changing set of circumstances. Many have done so by adopting a multilocal approach, establishing successful operations in markets around the world.
“For the most part these companies are run by smart, tough, experienced managers who have seen all types of trade environments, favorable and unfavorable,” Jonsson adds. “I believe the best-run companies in the world will find ways to win even when governments are trying to rearrange pieces on the chess board.”
Bottom line: Smart companies find a way to thrive, even in a less friendly trade environment. Short-term volatility can be an opportunity for long-term investors.
5. Will negative interest rates come to the U.S.?
For years central banks in Europe and Japan have maintained negative short-term interest rates to help stimulate growth in their economies. Today there are more than $15 trillion of negative yielding bonds in the developed world.
So far the Fed has refused to employ negative rates in the U.S., but with the world remaining in a muted-growth, low-inflation environment, could that policy stance change? What if another recession hits?
“Negative policy rates are, in my view, a remote possibility for the U.S. over the next few years,” says Tim Ng, a fixed income investment analyst. “I think the Fed’s playbook is more likely to follow what was done in the financial crisis: progressively cut rates to zero if needed and use forward guidance as a tool. The Fed could also buy bonds, as we saw with their quantitative easing program.”
Negative yields essentially mean that investors are paying the issuer to hold their money. That generally happens during times of economic uncertainty, when buyers rush to snap up investments viewed as safe havens. While the U.S. has entered a late-cycle environment and some excesses have begun to build, Spence says the U.S., barring any unforeseen external catalyst, should remain on a growth path for the foreseeable future.
Bottom line: With the Fed on hold and the economic growth picture brightening, negative rates are unlikely to surface in the U.S.
6. How should I position my portfolio for 2020?
Uncertainty will likely remain elevated in 2020. In such an environment, investors may be tempted to dramatically reduce stock holdings and shift to bonds. However, patient investors may be better served by maintaining well-balanced portfolios with a mix of global stocks and bonds.
“I suggest that anyone who is managing money make 2020 the year in which you create a new framework for how to invest globally,” Lovelace stresses. “The U.S./non-U.S. construct served us well for 40 or 50 years, but the world has changed. It’s time to think about how to invest in the best companies wherever they're based.”
Bottom line: Diversified, well-balanced portfolios can benefit patient, long-term investors.

262,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/robert-shiller-narrative-economics.html,Robert Shiller on 3 stories that helped shape the economy,Demographics & Culture,"November 6, 2019","“The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” This famous quote from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the depths of the Great Depression underscores a central theme made by Yale University economist Robert Shiller.
That’s not because we are in the middle of a downturn as severe as the 1930s, but because people’s emotions and the stories they tell each other can move the economy as much as housing starts and manufacturing activity.
Following the global financial crisis, many economists took a hit to their credibility for being blindsided by the worst downturn since the Great Depression. That upheaval prompted Shiller to encourage his colleagues to pay as much attention to stories as they do to economic statistics.
Shiller’s new book, “Narrative Economics,” argues that the study of economics has become myopic and needs to return to a broader view of the way our world works. Economics doesn’t sit in a silo but instead is a combination of psychology, anthropology, history and political science. As he tells Capital Group’s Matt Miller on the Capital Ideas podcast: “These are all fundamentally interrelated.”
How stories go viral
Imagine you live in a town that’s home to a large multinational company at which many of your neighbors work. At potluck dinners and chats in the driveway, they begin to express concern about the company’s fortunes and possible layoffs. Even if your business is doing well, the suggestion of hard times ahead could make you think twice about buying a car or splurging on an overseas vacation.
This is how ideas “go viral,” when emotions like fear can influence the decisions people and companies make. Multiply that across a region, state or country, and economic health could suffer.
At such times, Shiller advises economists to take a page from the epidemiologist’s playbook: Target the affected region and investigate the more subjective emotions that motivate people.
“You talk to the people in the plague-infected area … and tell them, ‘Your neighbor, he's really sick. You better get your vaccine. It's still not too late,’” says Shiller, who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2013 (along with two University of Chicago economists) for his work analyzing asset prices and inefficient markets.
Armed with both data and an understanding of the narrative themes that drive human action, Shiller explains that economists can develop a more complete picture of what’s happening in an economy and potentially provide a clearer forecast for what lies ahead.
Man versus machine
There is a lot of media coverage these days about new technologies automating jobs and displacing workers. It’s not a new story. This narrative really took off at the dawn of the industrial age when mechanized weaving machines began replacing textile workers in early 19th century England. That’s when the Luddites, a group of textile workers, fought automation by smashing the equipment that was replacing them — becoming the rootstock of anti-tech movements since then.
“With automation, you picture a factory with almost no employees,” Shiller says. “There are just a few scientists in a control room pushing buttons and [all the work is] done by robots. And then artificial intelligence is where the machines are smarter than you are.”
Whether the “Black Mirror”-esque laboratory that Shiller describes ever becomes reality isn’t important. The fear that it could happen is enough. “If stories about artificial intelligence break out that are newly dramatic, it could create a serious recession,” he says.
What’s old is new again
In his book, “Progress and Poverty,” journalist and political economist Henry George writes about the paradox of increasing inequality amid economic and technological progress, a familiar topic of pundits and academics today. But George wrote the book in 1879, following nearly a decade of crippling economic crises. “He does mention machines replacing people,” Shiller notes. “And then he says we have an obligation to help people who are replaced.”
George essentially wanted to tax the wealthy. Back then, that would be landowners. Today, it might be those who control capital and intellectual property. The tax would fund a “citizen’s dividend” for those who were displaced by technological forces. Sound familiar?
Another old-story-made-new revolves around the current debate over bitcoin. This harkens back to William Jennings Bryan and the bimetallism debates around the turn of the 19th century, Shiller explains. (Bimetallism was the practice that allowed silver, as well as gold, to back paper currency.)
Both movements developed outside the “elite” communities of finance and industry. Overindebted farmers rebelled against a system they saw as stacked against them. In the wake of the financial crisis, where many homeowners found themselves underwater and facing foreclosure, the idea of an alternative currency unbeholden to Wall Street’s whims is appealing.
As market-watchers today keep an eye on data to spot economic headwinds that could foretell a recession, economists and other commentators should heed the example of FDR, whose fireside chats offered calm counsel to an anxious nation. “Those words … did inspire people then, and it marked the turning point from the worst of the Great Depression,” Shiller says.
Robert Shiller is an economist, academic and bestselling author. He serves as Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale and is a fellow at the Yale School of Management's International Center for Finance. He received his Ph.D. from MIT and his bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences jointly with Eugene Fama and Lars Peter Hansen in 2013.

263,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/investors-eye-us-china-mini-trade-deal.html,Trade tightrope: Investors eye U.S.-China “mini” deal,Trade,"October 16, 2019","Market volatility cuts both ways, of course, with sharp swings up and down. We’ve seen no shortage of either in recent months as investor sentiment rose and fell with the slightest news of agreement or animosity in the U.S.-China trade dispute.
Global equity markets rallied on Friday’s announcement that the U.S. had agreed to suspend previously planned tariff increases on $250 billion of Chinese products. China also pledged to buy up to $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods, among other terms. The so-called “mini” deal is the first positive sign after months of trade war escalation, but how significant is it really? Markets pulled back a bit this week as investors pondered that question.
“This is a de-escalation, so from that perspective it’s a step in a constructive direction,” says Capital Group political economist Matt Miller. “But it’s far from a resolution to the conflict. In my view, the U.S. and China will be wrangling over these issues for decades to come, and Friday’s announcement simply reflects the desire on both sides to relieve some near-term pressures.”
For the U.S. administration, the near-term pressure is the 2020 presidential election, Miller explains. And for China’s leadership, there are domestic crosscurrents at play, including China’s slowing economic growth, rising food prices and pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.
“Both sides could use something they can call a ‘win’ right now,” Miller says. “It makes sense for a new equilibrium to be reached in the short term while the larger disagreements go unresolved. If this deal holds up — and that remains to be seen — both sides can claim victory in front of their domestic constituencies and perhaps put any longer term negotiations on a less dramatic footing.”
Perspectives on trade
With the long-running trade dispute dominating headlines for the better part of two years, Capital Ideas has featured a number of investment insights on the issue.
Below, Capital Group investment professionals offer their thoughts on several key questions, including whether trade disruptions could trigger a U.S. recession, how China is reacting to the trade war on the domestic front and whether multinational corporations can overcome growing trade-related headwinds.
Will a trade war push the U.S. economy into recession?
In a wide-ranging Q&A on the trade outlook for the U.S. economy, Capital Group economists Darrell Spence and Jared Franz note that market volatility may seem high these days, but it is just returning to historical averages. They also advance the view that the U.S. economy can handle a limited trade war, as long as there is no further escalation. If higher tariffs are eventually imposed by the U.S. and China retaliates, the risk of a recession rises substantially.
“It’s hard to know where the tipping point lies,” Spence says.
A view of China from the ground up
From the other side of the world, Hong Kong-based portfolio manager Steve Watson shares his thoughts on how Chinese consumers are living with the trade war. While China’s economy is slowing, the nation’s growing middle class continues to drive a powerful transition from a manufacturing and export-led economy toward a more balanced economy spearheaded by domestic consumer spending.
“When you observe China from L.A. or New York, it’s easy to imagine a country that is hunkered down, suffering from a prolonged trade war, but it certainly doesn’t feel that way in person,” Watson explains. “Life goes on and business keeps moving forward.”
Why multinationals can survive trade conflicts
Multinational companies are at the epicenter of the trade war, but as portfolio manager Jody Jonsson argues, well-managed multinationals are also well positioned to navigate a difficult environment and come out stronger on the other side.
Smart companies will figure it out, she says. Their seasoned management teams have seen all types of trade environments — favorable and unfavorable — and they have the expertise, the resources and the sheer muscle to survive and even thrive in a trade war.
“For investors, I think it’s very important to avoid focusing too much on the noise surrounding trade and protectionism,” Jonsson says. “To the extent that these trade conflicts cause investors to shy away from multinational companies, paying too much attention to the rhetoric is a detriment to successful, long-term investing.”

264,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/could-corporate-debt-sink-us-economy.html,Binge watching: Could corporate debt sink the U.S. economy?,U.S. Equities,"October 10, 2019","If you’re not keeping an eye on the debt binge in corporate America, it’s time to pay attention, according to three Capital Group investment team veterans. Non-financial corporate borrowing has soared to a record high of $9.95 trillion, or 47% of GDP, as of June 30, 2019, according to the Federal Reserve. 
What’s driving this debt deluge? Years of low interest rates, combined with two Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2019, have likely extended the more than 10-year-old U.S. economic expansion, and market returns have been reasonably strong.
Unconventional monetary policy decisions — aided by persistently low inflation — are giving heavily leveraged U.S. companies incentives to continue borrowing.
Much of the debt has been used to fund dividends, share buybacks and acquisitions. In many cases, these actions are helping to inflate reported earnings and share values.
So, what does this mean for companies, investors and the economy? Could this binge on cheap debt be the road to the next recession? Capital Group’s investment team is closely watching three key signals.
1. Not all dividend payments are sustainable
Joyce Gordon, portfolio manager, American Mutual Fund® and Capital Income Builder®
One important lesson I learned during the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 is to avoid companies with a lot of debt this late in the cycle. Companies with significant debt service face a number of challenges. For example, some companies today are issuing debt to buy back shares and pay their dividends, rather than using free cash flow.
It’s tempting for companies to do this because rates are so low, but it can be a warning sign. If rates rise and a company has trouble funding its debt, it may have to consider cutting its dividend or reducing share buybacks. I look carefully at companies with BBB credit ratings on the lower end of the investment-grade spectrum. If conditions deteriorate, some of these companies may be among the first to cut their dividends to preserve their ratings.
I have also seen some companies that have typically increased their dividend every year that have yet to do so over the past year. And in many cases, these have been the companies with a lot of leverage that are concerned about paying down debt. We have seen this with some of the food companies. It suggests that sales growth is tougher in this late-cycle environment.
At this point, I’m very focused on higher quality companies with very strong balance sheets that are less likely to have funding problems and are able to maintain dividend payments if we go into a recession.
2. Sooner or later, excesses will be recognized
Dane Mott, global accounting analyst
At this point in the cycle, companies appear to have become more comfortable with taking on debt.
Debt has been an engine for dividends and share buybacks as well as the significant amount of acquisitions that have been a hallmark of this long cycle. A look at data for U.S. companies in aggregate, shows that since 2013, dividends and stock buybacks have generally exceeded free cash flow generation. Companies have filled that funding gap through debt issuance, thanks to low interest rates and easy access to debt.
Companies cannot spend more than they make indefinitely. A look at interest coverage ratios ― which measure a company’s ability to service debt ― paints a picture that is reminiscent of 1998–1999, a period of elevated leverage shortly before a recession. History, of course, does not necessarily predict the future, but experience navigating similar periods can be informative.
What’s more, many companies that have been active in making acquisitions have reported solid earnings growth, but such cases require nuanced analysis because acquisitions can distort perceptions of company growth and health, and those distortions can be reflected in market prices. Acquisitions can be flattering to a company’s earnings because many of the costs associated with them can be excluded from some measures of earnings and hidden on balance sheets.
To be sure, in many cases companies have been borrowing prudently and investing capital efficiently. But it is important to be aware of the companies that have taken on excessive leverage and be mindful of the risks associated with this behavior. Being able to distinguish between those groups of companies will serve investors well when we enter tougher parts of the cycle.
3. Is the BBB bond market a systemic risk?
David Lee, portfolio manager, American Funds Corporate Bond Fund® and The Bond Fund of America®
This late in the cycle, I think it’s prudent to take a cautious approach to corporate debt. The market appears to be on high alert, ready to pull back on any hint of negative news. The upcoming U.S. presidential election is amplifying uncertainty around the trade war with China, Brexit, and Fed policy.
The good news is that companies have borrowed at very low interest rates and, on the whole, they have been somewhat disciplined about the debt they’ve taken on. What’s more, corporate profits have increased significantly in the past decade. Profitable companies generally have ample free cash flow and can easily make interest payments when they’re due. The low interest rate environment and drive to increase shareholder value have contributed to more companies willing to operate with higher debt loads.
Against this backdrop, the rise of triple-B corporate debt — the lowest investment-grade rating — is a development I’m keeping an eye on. There is now around $2.9 trillion of U.S. BBB corporate debt outstanding, which is more than four times as much as in 2008. These bonds account for 50% of investment-grade corporate debt. 
Despite this profound change in corporate America’s credit profile, we have seen many firms where higher quality companies are keenly focused on protecting their investment-grade credit ratings. There is a willingness to take measures such as cutting dividends to retain the access to relatively cheap capital that comes with an investment-grade rating.
Although an imminent recession seems unlikely, the rise in BBB-rated corporates suggests that the next downturn may see a record number of downgrades to high yield due in part to the larger size of the market today. That would likely cause BBB and BB credit spreads to widen dramatically.
A wave of downgrades may also make it more difficult for investors to buy and sell bonds, because available dealer liquidity has not kept pace with the growth in the market. This could also contribute to corporate credit spreads widening.
Of course, credit spreads (the yield gap between corporates and Treasuries) may also widen even if downgrades don’t pick up. Significantly weaker economic data, geopolitical shocks or other escalating signs of recession could also be triggers. Because investment-grade companies tend to be under-researched on the credit side, volatility has a silver lining: creating attractive entry points for selective investors such as Capital.

265,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/life-after-brexit-will-european-economy-rebound.html,Life after Brexit: Will the European economy rebound?,Europe,"October 2, 2019","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
The European economy is struggling with global trade disruption and political turmoil.
Central bank officials are responding with another substantial dose of monetary stimulus.
Despite economic headwinds, company-specific investment opportunities remain.
It’s been another disappointing year for the European economy, even though 2019 is only two-thirds done.
The United Kingdom is beset with Brexit uncertainty. Germany is teetering on the verge of recession. Protests in the streets of Paris until recently threatened to destabilize the French government. On top of all that, global disruption from the U.S.-China trade war has weighed heavily on Europe’s export-dependent economy.
“I doubt many Europeans will be sad to see 2019 fade into history,” says Capital Group economist Robert Lind. “It’s been a tough year politically, economically and in the broader societal context.”
However, there is reason to think 2020 will be better, Lind explains. There are several important “ifs” in play: If a truce can be negotiated on the global trade front, if central bank stimulus measures do their job and if a Brexit resolution is finally achieved, those events could remove the large cloud of uncertainty that has hampered European economic growth in recent years.
Stimulus on the way
“Broadly speaking, I think the European economy should gradually start to show signs of improvement in 2020 as some political risks begin to diminish and as looser monetary and fiscal policy work their way through the system,” Lind says.
The European Central Bank last month cut its key policy rate further into negative territory, from –0.4% to –0.5%. ECB officials also said they would relaunch a €20 billion per month bond-buying program in a bid to spark inflation and jumpstart the European economy. Many eurozone governments also have been loosening fiscal policy to help the cause.
Inflation has been running far below the ECB’s target rate of roughly 2% a year, and GDP growth has hovered around 1% on an annualized basis. That’s about half the growth rate of the U.S. economy.
Outgoing ECB President Mario Draghi said aggressive stimulus measures are necessary to help offset the damaging effects of trade wars and slowing economic growth around the world. Draghi’s successor, former IMF chief Christine Lagarde, is expected to continue advocating for Draghi’s policies when she takes office November 1.
Another unique challenge to the European economy: the U.K.’s bid to leave the European Union. The U.K. faces an October 31 deadline to approve a hotly debated withdrawal agreement, although it now appears likely that British lawmakers will seek another extension in the long-running Brexit negotiations.
Meanwhile, Germany is nearing a recession as the U.S.-China trade dispute hammers the German manufacturing sector, particularly the auto industry. Germany’s economy shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter and is expected to fall further when third-quarter data is released. A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
Currency tailwind coming?
Since the ECB’s September rate cut, the euro has continued to weaken against the U.S. dollar, extending a strong dollar trend that has continued for years. On a year-to-date basis, the euro has declined more than 4% as negative interest rates in the eurozone (coupled with higher rates in the U.S.) have made dollar-based assets generally more attractive to investors.
The dollar is significantly overvalued against the euro, says Jens Sondergaard, a Capital Group currency analyst. Once that trend reverses course, he notes, it could provide a nice tailwind for euro-denominated assets.
Sondergaard expects the dollar to weaken in 2020–21 as U.S. economic growth softens, but he concedes that currency movements are notoriously difficult to predict. In the short term, the euro could fall further as the U.S. and European economies diverge.
“The relationship between interest rates and currencies has essentially broken down in a negative-rate world,” Sondergaard says. “We shouldn’t expect that correlation to return anytime soon. The more important drivers of currency movements today are relative bond flows and relative growth expectations.
“So, the big question is, can the euro rally when the U.S. economy starts to weaken?” Sondergaard asks. “That remains to be seen.”
Investment implications
Despite the economic headwinds, or perhaps because of them, Europe is a classic stock-picker’s market, says Carl Kawaja, a portfolio manager with American Funds EuroPacific Growth Fund®. Investors can’t rely on robust economic growth to lift share prices, which places more emphasis on company fundamentals.
“Uncertainty creates opportunity,” Kawaja says. “We like it when things are a bit murky and difficult to figure out. In this type of environment, we are finding no shortage of compelling opportunities in Europe, both from a growth perspective and from a valuation perspective.”
On the growth side, Kawaja looks for fast-growing companies that are disrupting their respective industries. On the value side, he sees interesting opportunities in some hard-hit European auto companies.
It is important to note that although European stocks have continued to lag U.S. equity markets this year, European returns have still been solid on an absolute basis. As of September 27, the MSCI Europe Index is up 14% in U.S.-dollar terms and more than 18% in local currency. By comparison, U.S. stocks have gained nearly 20% so far this year, as measured by the S&P 500 Index.
Although European economic growth has been disappointing so far in 2019, investment returns have charted a decidedly different course — which serves as a timely reminder that the economy and the stock market aren’t always on the same page.

266,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/why-inflation-low-despite-rate-cuts.html,The Fed cuts rates again amid low inflation. What’s keeping it down?,Inflation,"September 17, 2019","The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting — the second cut this year. This easy monetary policy is thanks in part to low inflation. But why has inflation remained so low, especially in the face of a tight labor market?
The reasons, which are partly structural and partly cyclical, will likely keep interest rates low and the Fed in an accommodative mood for a while.
Major central banks worry that these factors could have a sustained disinflationary impact, especially on developed economies. As a result, they are willing to continue to experiment with unconventional monetary policy. The Fed isn’t the only major central bank taking early action. The European Central Bank also cut its deposit rate to a record low of –0.5 in September and announced plans to restart quantitative easing (QE).
Low inflation is troubling to central bankers because if it dips too low an economy could fall into deflation. As economic textbooks teach, the prospect that things will cost less tomorrow than they do today encourages people to delay buying. They are also less likely to borrow, as debt balances become harder to pay off over time amid deflation. If enough people cut spending and avoid credit, then businesses are less likely to hire and invest.
Whether central banks can bring inflation closer to target remains to be seen. Here are the five most significant factors keeping inflation down.
1. Technology drives disinflation across industries.
As companies modernize and become more efficient, they are able to reduce costs and pass on lower prices to consumers. Take Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods, for example. The first thing Amazon did was to cut prices on eggs, butter, cheese, milk and other products.
But technology also has an impact on more complex goods and services prices. The auto industry provides a clear example. Old internal combustion engine cars were made of steel, aluminum and other raw materials. As cars transition into computers that offer autonomous driving, the raw materials will be very different.
Computing power is historically disinflationary — if not outright deflationary — because computing power gets faster, parts get better and algorithms get smarter. That’s disinflationary. This type of technological change is impacting many industries.              
2. U.S. consumers are saving more and spending less.
American consumers are behaving differently than they have during past economic expansions. They are saving more and spending less, a behavior that economists refer to as deleveraging. This is supported by the data: Household debt-to-GDP is at 76, down from almost 100 heading into the last recession.
To understand one way in which this influences inflation, consider housing — a major source of shelter costs. This component is the largest in the inflation basket. So if Americans aren’t increasingly borrowing to buy homes (and driving up prices in the process), then inflation will have a harder time gaining steam.
Core inflation — the measure that strips out the volatile food and energy components — has only been above the Fed’s 2% target for one sustained period over the past 25 years. And that was at the height of the housing bubble.
The dynamics of a slow recovery, like we’ve seen in the U.S., also come into play. If this expansion had been characterized by stronger sustained growth, demand would have been greater as well. Without as much spending by consumers, prices have not drifted upwards in the way you would expect during the upswing of an economic cycle.
3. Rising asset prices have not translated into much greater spending.
The Fed’s efforts to stimulate the economy through its asset-buying programs definitely impacted some prices: Equities and other financial asset prices have soared. This has disproportionately benefited wealthy consumers whose financial portfolios have improved but hasn’t resulted in much additional spending since higher income consumers save much of their income.
QE had a more muted impact on middle class and less affluent groups. They are more likely to spend when they feel they’re in a better place economically. Perhaps if their wallets had felt more of a jolt from the stimulus, they would have spent more, but QE was slow and incremental. If the Fed restarts its program in the future, it may aim for a more “big bang” impact.
4. China’s economic slowdown has dampened demand for metals and commodities.
When China joined the World Trade organization in 2001, it kicked off a robust economic expansion. This led the nation to become the dominant global driver of commodities and industrial prices.
Over the past several years, however, China’s growth has begun to slow from double-digit annualized rates to closer to 6%. At this point, a number of emerging and developed markets are linked to China’s economic success through trade. As demand weakens, industrial and commodity prices will not rise as quickly. That should have an impact on its trade partners, keeping its exports cheaper and providing less of a tailwind to inflation.
5. Workers’ bargaining power isn’t strong enough to sharply boost wages.
The influence of China and other emerging markets has been felt by inflation in another way. These rapidly developing economies have been exporting workers to the global marketplace, depressing wage growth and stifling broader inflation.
A glut of global workers isn’t the only challenge. Unemployment generally dips to very low levels late in an economic cycle, which provides workers greater bargaining power and drives up wages. However, despite extremely low unemployment in the U.S. over the past few years, wage growth has been modest.
There are several reasons for this. Increased labor mobility no longer requires employers to pay new hires more when facing worker scarcity. Additionally, U.S. workers have less bargaining power than they once did when unions played a more prominent role.
In the eurozone, guilds, apprenticeships and other structural labor market features typically give workers more clout at the bargaining table with corporations. These features facilitate stronger wage growth, leading to more pass-through from labor markets to inflation. So even Germany, which is experiencing weaker growth than the U.S., has slightly higher inflation. These other economies have more of a structural inflationary system due to a sort of institutionalized wage growth.
Technology is also having a negative impact on wage growth. Innovations like robots and machine learning are increasing productivity and displacing workers. This trend will ramp up even more over the next 10 to 20 years, leaving workers with even less bargaining power. Employers won’t feel as much pressure to lift wages, and inflation will suffer.
Although the Fed and other central banks will continue to face challenges in their efforts to increase inflation, certain economic dynamics could be different in the future. For example, if consumers ramp up spending, monetary stimulus could have a greater impact. As could new policy. The Fed is exploring one option known as average inflation targeting. This strategy encourages consumer prices to drift higher for a period of time to compensate for their time below target. The goal is to hit a 2% average over a cycle.
To succeed, central banks would need to overcome actual inflation’s persistence. As monetary policymakers have learned by recent experience, moving the needle on inflation isn’t easy — and reshaping expectations takes time.

267,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/argentina-update.html,Argentina update: Q&A with emerging markets debt investment analyst,Emerging Markets,"September 5, 2019","Argentina’s currency and financial markets have experienced a sharp selloff in recent weeks. Emerging markets debt investment analyst and portfolio manager Steve Backes gives his take on why market sentiment has soured, whether capital controls will bring stability and the outlook for Argentina.
What sparked the recent volatility in Argentina?
In early August, the opposition presidential candidate, Alberto Fernandez, did unexpectedly well in Argentina’s primary election, gaining significantly more of the vote than President Mauricio Macri.
Markets appear worried that, if Fernandez were to win October’s general election, his policies — both in terms of the economy and debt restructuring — could undo some of the modest progress made under Macri. That’s why we’ve seen a broad-based selloff in the peso, as well as equity and bond markets.
Why were capital controls imposed on September 1, and what are they?
Put simply, a crisis of confidence had prompted many Argentines and foreign investors to try to get their money out of the country. This led to a sharp depreciation in the peso, which the Argentine central bank sought to stem by using its foreign currency reserves.
In the two weeks following Fernandez’s landslide victory in the primary, the central bank burned through close to 20% of its dollar reserves defending the peso. Clearly that was unsustainable.
Ultimately, officials faced two choices: let the peso free fall and find a new level, or impose capital controls to try to create stability more quickly. On September 1, the government chose the latter option.
The key capital control measures restrict residents’ foreign currency monthly purchases, compel exporters to repatriate foreign earnings, and force banks and other companies to seek authorization before selling pesos to receive foreign currency. 
Are the capital controls working?
The bond, equity and currency markets were hit hard in August, but I think capital controls have a decent chance of bringing near-term stability. Although it’s early days, the peso has strengthened a little as some of the immediate downward pressure on it has been alleviated.
That being said, the demand for dollars has not disappeared. For example, Argentine residents have been turning to the unofficial market for dollars. In this parallel market that has developed for smaller transactions with brokers, the peso has depreciated compared to the official rate.
There’s a big question mark hovering over equity and bond markets related to the policy agenda of the next government. The general election is in October and, if he wins, Fernandez won’t take office until December. Until there’s greater certainty on the political outlook, I think investors should be prepared for a bumpy ride.
What’s your near-term outlook for Argentina’s economy?
The encouraging pickup in economic activity seen in the second quarter will likely reverse, and inflation could move upward again. Without a clearer sense of the next government’s policy agenda, uncertainty could have a chilling effect on spending by companies and individuals.
I’m also keeping a close eye on the banking system. Overall, Argentine banks have significant reserves at the central bank and elsewhere. And yet, there have been media reports of some banks unilaterally restricting withdrawals.
I’m hopeful such restrictions won’t become more widespread. The current government will try to avoid deposit controls on dollar deposits at banks. Given the capital controls, the incentive for dollars has lessened. Also, the last thing the economy needs is for the banking system to grind to a halt. 
Another big unknown is how the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is viewing the latest developments. As part of last year’s $57 billion bailout program, the IMF is due to disburse $5.4 billion to Argentina by the end of September.
Payments scheduled for September and December may be delayed if the IMF decides the Macri government’s progress toward righting the country’s finances has been overshadowed by the deteriorating outlook and increased political uncertainty.
With the government facing substantial debt payments through year-end, any pause by the IMF would greatly diminish economic prospects.
What’s your investment outlook around Argentine bonds?
As an investment analyst, I take a longer term view. At present, I believe that Argentina is facing a liquidity problem rather than a solvency problem; it should, therefore, be able to meet its obligations to bondholders by changing the maturity profile of some local debt.
There are various maneuvers it can explore to bridge the financing gap it faces in 2020 and 2021. Specifically, the government has proposed extending the maturities for T-bills issued under local law so that it has more time to pay interest to bondholders. This proposal would need to be approved by Argentina’s Congress. A similar approach may take place for longer maturity local-law paper. For U.S. dollar-denominated bonds, any restructuring would have to be approved by creditors. All that being said, the situation is fluid and, as mentioned, the IMF’s stance is a big unknown.
Final thoughts
Recent events underscore the importance of diversification when investing in global bonds. For instance, recent exposure to Argentine bonds for Capital World Bond Fund® has been relatively modest compared to some other core global bond funds, according to recent media reports. It’s a similar story for American Funds Emerging Markets Bond Fund®, which seeks to invest broadly across emerging markets, and for our other funds that are able to invest in emerging markets debt.*
Focusing portfolios on the highest yielding bonds for short-term gains is not our approach at Capital. We strive to build appropriately balanced portfolios — using research to find diverse bonds that can offer a favorable balance of potential return and risk over time.

Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Higher yielding, higher risk bonds can fluctuate in price more than investment-grade bonds, so investors should maintain a long-term perspective.
The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds."
268,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/investing-ahead-recession-5-mistakes.html,Investing ahead of a recession: 5 mistakes to avoid,Market Volatility,"September 3, 2019","It’s been a summer to remember for investors, but for all the wrong reasons. The yield curve inverted, trade conflicts intensified and the U.S. economy showed more signs of its age. But just as the summer inevitably turns to fall, investors may be wondering if the economy is moving into its next stage too. Could a recession be on the horizon?
Maybe. Maybe not. Recessions are notoriously difficult to predict , even when signals are starting to flash red. But that doesn’t mean investors should do nothing. Since the stock market tends to lead the economy by several months it’s often better to be proactive. Late in the economic cycle can be a good time to re-evaluate portfolios, ensuring they are properly balanced and positioned for elevated volatility.
Some may think the best way to prepare portfolios for a recession is to drastically reduce stocks in favor of bonds. The problem with this approach is that it requires a soothsayer-like ability to time the markets. Some of the strongest returns can occur during late stages of an economic cycle and immediately after a market bottom, so being wrong on either turning point can be devastating to long-term returns. A more realistic approach may be to maintain an appropriate balance between equities and fixed income but upgrade the quality of both.
Upgrade your stock portfolio
In volatile markets, investors often tilt their equity portfolios toward value investing and focus more on dividend stocks. This can be an effective way of reducing portfolio risk, but it can also give investors a false sense of security if they don’t know what they’re buying. Here we highlight three common assumptions often made by investors when they look to increase their value-oriented allocation followed by a suggestion for what may be a better way to upgrade equity portfolios.
Assumption 1: Value investing will always reduce volatility.
Reality: Value indexes can be just as risky as the broader market. Portfolio risk is commonly measured by standard deviation, downside capture ratio and average drawdown. If moving to a value portfolio ahead of expected volatility, you’d want these measures to show lower risk than the overall market. But surprisingly, we see exactly the opposite for both the Russell 1000 Value Index (the most common benchmark for large-cap value investing) and the Morningstar Large Value category (a composite of value-oriented mutual funds) over the last 10 years.
The takeaway? Not all value is created equal. It can be more effective to hold a mix of dividend-paying stocks than a value index.
Assumption 2: Value investing is the same as dividend investing.
Reality: Many stocks in value indexes don’t pay dividends. Dividend-paying stocks have tended to hold up better during periods of volatility, so investors may benefit from more dividend exposure ahead of a recession. But don’t assume every value fund will make dividends a priority. About 22% of stocks in the Russell 1000 Value Index paid dividends of less than 0.1%, as of December 31, 2018.
Assumption 3: Value investing only includes high-quality companies.
Reality: Low-quality and distressed companies are commonly included in value portfolios. Around 40% of the rated companies in the Russell 1000 Value Index were BBB- or lower (as of December 31, 2018), including many high yielding dividend payers. Companies often appear solid on the surface but carry significant debt burdens and may be on the cusp of losing their investment-grade credit rating. A missed payment or a downgrade could send share prices tumbling, so investors should focus on higher quality companies that are most likely to maintain consistent dividend payments.
What can be done instead?
Investors looking to reduce equity volatility ahead of a recession should consider more rigorous fund screens and not assume that any product with a “value” label will help them achieve their goals. As we see with the Russell 1000 Value Index, even the flagship benchmark for value investing falls short in many ways. Consider a screen that includes funds with the following factors:
High percentage of dividend-paying stocks
High percentage of companies with credit ratings of BBB and above
Low fund-risk metrics, including average drawdown, downside capture ratio and standard deviation
There are many funds that fit these criteria. Within the American Funds family, two funds to consider for your clients’ portfolios include Washington Mutual Investors Fund and American Mutual Fund®.
Upgrade your core bond portfolio
Fixed income investments can provide an essential measure of stability and capital preservation, especially when stock markets are volatile. But here too, investors often assume their portfolios are safer than they really are.
Assumption 4: In a low-rate world, I should reach for yield to get income.
Reality: Reaching for higher yield can be risky. High-yield credit spreads have tightened, and when that has happened in the past credit has significantly lagged U.S. Treasuries. Bond funds with more high-yield exposure also tend to have higher correlations to equity, something investors should avoid in the core bond holdings if they are trying to reduce portfolio volatility.
Assumption 5: Short duration will help reduce volatility.
Reality: Shortening duration probably won’t help as the Fed is done hiking rates for now. Investors often turn to short-term bonds for lower interest rate risk, but that is usually most beneficial in a rising-rate environment. Following the Fed’s rate cut in July, markets have been pricing in five more rate cuts by the end of 2020.
What can be done instead?
Research firm Morningstar helped simplify bond fund selection earlier this year when it split its largest Intermediate-Term Bond category based on credit risk. Bond funds with less than 5% high-yield exposure were relabeled Intermediate Core, while funds with more now fall into the Intermediate Core-Plus category.
The distinction can be especially important during periods of elevated market volatility, when it’s likely you want more core in your portfolio. During the last six equity corrections, the core category had higher returns than core-plus and provided much needed portfolio stability. The Bond Fund of America® is now the largest fund in the category.
Maintain a long-term perspective
Recessions can be painful, but investors who are well prepared and maintain a long-term investment horizon should be comforted that economic declines have been relatively small blips in economic history. Over the last 65 years, the U.S. has been in an official recession less than 15% of all months, with the average recession lasting just under a year. Maintaining a balanced, well-diversified portfolio can help investors avoid the pitfalls of market timing, while being prepared for the relative short-term volatility that comes with recessions.

The U.S. economy looks healthy based on underlying fundamentals.
It’s a tale of two economies: strong domestic demand but weaker industrial activity.
Federal Reserve rate cuts should provide a tailwind for stocks.
A brewing trade war with China remains the biggest wild card.
If you’re just returning from a few weeks of summer vacation, then welcome back to a fundamentally changed investment environment. Since July 31, the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates for the first time in a decade, the U.S.-China trade dispute has intensified and market volatility has returned with a vengeance.
Against this backdrop, Capital Group economists Darrell Spence and Jared Franz have revisited their outlook for the U.S. economy, including the prospects for a near-term recession. In the following Q&A, they offer their thoughts on the Fed’s dramatic policy shift, the potential impact of new tariffs on China and what it all means for investors.
How have these events influenced your assessment of the U.S. economy?
Darrell Spence: In many ways, the U.S. economy still looks fundamentally healthy. GDP growth is averaging above 2% on an annualized basis. Retail sales are solid. Wages are rising in excess of inflation. Job growth is strong and the unemployment rate is well below 4%. If we just look at the domestic data, the U.S. economy remains in good shape.
Given these domestic conditions, our base case is that the decade-long U.S. economic expansion isn’t immediately threatened by China trade tensions or slowing economic growth elsewhere in the world. However, any further deterioration in the trade environment would, in our view, substantially raise the risk of a U.S. recession.
With the U.S. imposing new tariffs on China later this year and China moving to devalue its currency, the situation is clearly getting worse. It’s hard to know where the tipping point lies.
Are falling bond yields and an inverted yield curve predicting a recession?
Jared Franz: One of the many reasons that bond yields have fallen so precipitously is that the market believes the Fed will reduce rates an additional five times between now and year-end 2020, assuming cuts of 25 basis points each. Including the July move, that would be 150 basis points over an 18-month period, a pace that has occurred only once outside of a recession. An inverted yield curve — where short-term rates exceed long-term rates — is sending the same signal.
That said, there are other factors pushing U.S. bond yields lower, including negative interest rates in Europe and Japan. Bonds trade in a global market, and it could be that investors are not satisfied with 10-year German bunds yielding around –0.6%. In that environment, U.S. Treasuries at 1.6% obviously look a lot more attractive.
With the European Central Bank likely to cut policy rates further into negative territory next month, global bond yields are effectively acting as an anchor on U.S. yields. That may help to explain why the bond market appears to be predicting a recession while U.S. stocks remain near all-time highs.
Are there any signs of weakness in the domestic economy?
Spence: We see a tale of two economies: strong domestic consumption but weaker industrial activity. Declining exports and pre-tariff inventory stocking are undoubtedly playing a role as the precarious trade environment weighs on industrial production. At the same time, the consumption side looks strong, and we’ve seen a decent bounce back in U.S. retail sales. This is not unlike the economic environment we experienced in 2015–16.
The gap between industrial production and retail sales, in our view, will eventually narrow through a recovery in industrial activity rather than slowing domestic demand. Exports only account for about 13.2% of U.S. output, so domestic factors tend to drive the overall direction of the economy.
Again, though, this optimistic view is based on an assumption that the U.S. and China are able to avoid a full-blown trade war. If the U.S. imposes 25% tariffs on all Chinese imports, for instance, and China retaliates, then that would present a very difficult scenario that would almost guarantee recessionary conditions in the U.S. and globally.
Do you think the Fed would ever resort to negative interest rates?
Franz: I don’t think so. Negative interest rates are incredibly damaging to the banking sector, as we’ve seen in Europe and Japan. They also make it very difficult for central banks to respond if economic conditions deteriorate further. The Fed would likely use quantitative easing, forward guidance and other tools first, and only consider a negative-rate policy in the event of another global financial crisis on the scale of 2008–09.
In this declining rate environment, are stocks or bonds more attractive?
Spence: For most of this year, we’ve seen stocks and bonds rally at the same time. That’s not likely to continue. Barring a recession, we think adding U.S. equity exposure makes more sense in this environment. The Fed is adding monetary fuel to a growing economy, and that could propel risky asset prices higher, while it would be difficult for bond yields to move a lot lower than what is already priced into the market. Yes, equity valuations are relatively high, but lower bond yields help support those higher valuations.
Do you think U.S. stocks will end the year in positive territory?
Franz: Fed officials seem determined not to go against market expectations, so there is a good chance they will continue to ease, providing a favorable environment for stock prices to drift higher. Although U.S. corporate earnings have turned down slightly, 76% of S&P 500 companies have, as of August 9, reported second-quarter earnings per share above consensus estimates, so that bodes well for the earnings outlook.
Overall, U.S. markets and the economy appear to be taking the trade dispute in stride, at least for now. Even with the announced tariff increases in early August and China’s currency manipulation, U.S. stocks are still up more than 17% on a year-to-date basis, and I expect double-digit gains to hold up through the end of the year.
Until some sort of trade compromise is reached, market volatility will likely remain elevated, but even that metric needs to be put in perspective. At current levels, the higher volatility we’ve seen recently is simply a return to normal after a period of relative calm. Those days appear to be over for now.
Barring a full-blown trade war, do you think a U.S. recession is on the horizon during the next few years?
Spence: We’ve been saying for quite a while now that the U.S. is exhibiting classic late-cycle economic conditions. At some point, this remarkable 11-year expansion will come to an end. But if we can avoid a trade war, and if the Fed continues to stimulate the economy, then it would not be surprising to see another year or two of uninterrupted growth. We could experience a downturn in 2021, but that’s really just a placeholder for now as we continue to evaluate key economic indicators. As the Fed likes to say, the outlook remains data dependent.
Investment implications
Where appropriate, maintain a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds. Stocks have higher potential, but given greater uncertainty emanating from trade disputes, downside protection is important.
Equity portfolios should be diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. as well as growth and dividend-oriented stocks. In any market pullback, growth stocks tend to suffer sharper declines.
Ensure bond portfolios are not excessively exposed to credit, which tends to move in the same direction as stocks. Bond portfolios should have a low correlation to equities.

The dramatic shift in Fed policy should help support global economic growth.
Central banks in Europe and Asia also have embraced monetary easing.
In a long-term low-rate environment, cyclical assets look relatively attractive.
The Federal Reserve’s move to lower interest rates yesterday made history on several fronts. It was the first rate cut since the global financial crisis in 2008, the first reduction with U.S. unemployment below 4% and the first time since the dot-com era of the 1990s that central bankers decided to ease policy with U.S. stocks at or near record highs.
Unconventional monetary policy — in the U.S. and around the world — has become the norm. Policymakers at the Fed, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and others are marching further into uncharted territory, confirming that the era of ultra-low interest rates is far from over.
On Wednesday, the Fed announced that it would reduce its key policy rate by 25 basis points to a range of 2.00% to 2.25%, bringing an end to a relatively shallow tightening cycle. In all, the Fed raised rates nine times since December 2015.
Experimental monetary policy
Undoubtedly, the Fed will take some criticism for abandoning its previous rate-hiking plans at a time of solid — albeit slowing — U.S. economic growth and record-low unemployment. In normal times, that’s when rates are supposed to move higher. But that’s only part of the story.
“Central banks often get a bad rap, but you can’t ignore the results we’ve seen over the past decade,” says Andrew Cormack, a portfolio manager with Capital World Bond Fund®. “In the U.S., we’re now 11 years into an economic expansion, unemployment has fallen from 10% to below 4%, the stock market is hitting all-time highs and wages have finally started moving higher.
“During and after the financial crisis, central bankers had to be imaginative with unorthodox and experimental monetary policy,” Cormack continues. “It’s hard to argue that they’ve done a bad job. And, ultimately, investors who stayed invested have been rewarded.”
Rate cut rationale
That doesn’t mean there is nothing to worry about, Cormack says. Central banks are taking aggressive steps for valid reasons — signs of slowing global economic growth, a brewing U.S.-China trade war and a stubborn lack of inflation in many developed countries. Yesterday’s move by the Fed was what Cormack calls an “insurance cut” — an attempt to get ahead of events that may put further pressure on U.S. and global growth.
In this environment, Cormack’s view is that interest rates will stay low as long as inflation does the same. For 30 years, central bankers worried about rising inflation, he notes. Today, they find themselves in the opposite position, struggling to generate inflation in the range of 2% a year. With inflation levels below target in the U.S., Europe and Japan, central banks are looking for creative ways to boost prices.
Europe embraces negative rates.
European officials have pursued that goal with urgency as the eurozone economy has weakened under the weight of trade tariffs and political turmoil. The European Central Bank introduced negative interest rates in 2014 and, last week, officials there suggested they may soon go further into negative territory in an ongoing effort to lift inflation. The ECB’s key policy rate now stands at –0.40%.
Negative interest rates have effectively pushed down bond yields across Europe and elsewhere, resulting in trillions of dollars in global bonds now trading at negative yields. That means an investor who lends to the German government, for example, is likely to lose money on the transaction. The yield on Germany’s benchmark 10-year bond stood at negative –0.43%, as of July 31, compared to positive 2.02% for 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds.
Game over for Super Mario
ECB President Mario Draghi led the charge toward experimental monetary policy in Europe, earning the nickname “Super Mario” in the process. His eight-year term ends in October, which raised concerns that a new ECB leader might take a different approach. However, it now appears that Christine Lagarde, the former head of the International Monetary Fund, will assume the job. That means a likely continuation of Draghi’s activist policies, including his signature pledge to do “whatever it takes.”
“Lagarde’s appointment clearly signals that more integration and growth-friendly policies are in store for the eurozone,” says Capital Group economist Robert Lind. “She now stands poised to complete the ECB’s path toward the kind of flexible independence enjoyed by other modern central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.”
Thus, the ECB probably will follow the Fed’s lead by cutting interest rates later this year, Lind adds. It may also resume a previously discontinued €2.6 trillion bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing. Both moves were foreshadowed by Draghi at the ECB’s meeting last week. Lagarde is expected to take over on November 1.
Don’t fight the Feds.
Not to be outdone by the Fed and ECB, other central banks around the world are following the same well-worn path to easy money. Contributing to a remarkable global easing cycle, central banks in Indonesia, South Africa, South Korea and Turkey all moved to cut interest rates in July. Earlier in the year, India, Malaysia, New Zealand and the Philippines did the same.
The Bank of Japan, an early pioneer of quantitative easing, took no action on rates at its July 29–30 meeting, but officials there continue to pursue a novel yield curve control policy targeting a 0% yield on 10-year government bonds. The BoJ already owns nearly half of the government’s outstanding debt in addition to some equity assets. China is also holding rates steady for the time being while taking other measures to boost lending and stimulate economic growth.
Investment implications
As the Fed begins a new rate-cutting cycle, the outlook improves for economically sensitive areas of the market. If a U.S. recession was on the near-term horizon, that event has likely been pushed back, notes Margaret Steinbach, a fixed income investment specialist with Capital Group.
In the bond market, Fed accommodation will provide support to riskier sectors, but valuations are stretched in most areas. Treasuries remain attractive primarily as a counterbalance to stocks in a well-diversified portfolio. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, may also be an excellent diversifier, she adds. “TIPS should do better in an environment where central banks are doing everything they can to boost inflation,” Steinbach says, “and TIPS are also attractively valued at the moment.”
Outside a core bond allocation, areas of the market that were hurt during the Fed’s rate-hiking cycle are another place to look for value, she adds. That would include emerging markets debt, which has struggled in recent years under the weight of higher interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar.

273,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/india-election-markets.html,What India's election means for financial markets,India,"May 8, 2019","Financial markets are anxiously awaiting the final outcome of India's five-week general election. Official results won’t be known until May 23, and the big unknown is: Can Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP party win enough votes to maintain their legislative majority and empower them to continue pursuing pro-business reforms?
The result will impact emerging markets sentiment. Modi won a decisive victory five years ago, and he’s taken some strides to improve India’s business climate.
While Modi has not realized all of his lofty expectations as of yet, investors have acknowledged the progress: Indian stocks have widely outpaced the benchmark emerging markets index since May 2014 despite uneven economic growth and oil-price swings that resulted in bouts of volatility.
Fresh from a recent trip to India, portfolio manager Nick Grace, co-principal investment officer of New World Fund®, spoke to us about potential disruption in India’s retail sector and the impact of Modi’s reforms. The fund owns three Indian stocks among its top 10 holdings.
What does this election mean for India and its equity markets?
India is on the cusp of major changes, and it’s important to maintain the reform momentum that’s been established. I commend Modi for what’s he’s done. He’s ushered in a bankruptcy law that’s forcing banks to recognize bad loans more quickly and a national sales tax that replaced an inefficient web of state taxes.
There’s also been some backlash. Modi’s abrupt move to cancel 86% of the country’s currency in November 2016 was deeply unpopular. But he wanted to tackle corruption to improve the long-term health of doing business in India and increase the country’s tax revenue base.
In this election, it’s certainly possible Modi won’t have the same backing to push for sweeping change that he had when he became prime minister. That said, we continue to have strong convictions in our top Indian holdings, which include Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank.
There are several possible outcomes to this election.
Modi wins and the BJP retains a healthy majority in the legislature; this is my base case, and I believe this would be the best possible outcome for markets.
Modi wins a narrow majority or is forced to form a coalition government to retain power, which would likely further slow his deregulation agenda.
Modi and the BJP are defeated.
Ultimately, investors should be braced for some volatility if his power is weakened. Right now, markets appear to be pricing in a Modi win.
How have you been navigating this landscape in New World Fund?
Investing in cyclical companies has been a challenge given economic disruptions and periods of higher oil prices, which have made cement and auto companies less appealing. And many consumer-related stocks are expensive.
Overall, valuations for Indian stocks are demanding. They trade at 18.2 times forward earnings in aggregate, which is pricey compared to a multiple of 11.8 times for the benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets Investable Market Index.
That’s why I’m focused on companies that I believe have specific growth drivers that would be unaffected by what results from the election.
Conglomerate Reliance Industries is one of those companies. It upended India’s telecom sector when it launched its Jio mobile service in 2016. Jio now has one of India’s largest subscriber bases at 306 million, and the industry has consolidated with its emergence, leaving it as a dominant player in a country where mobile phone usage is projected to expand significantly.
Reliance is now looking to leverage its capabilities to build a mobile platform that connects manufacturers to retailers and consumers. While still in the very early stages, this initiative may lead to some promising growth opportunities.
Amazon and Walmart are investing billions of dollars in India. What does this mean for the retail sector and e-commerce?
I believe we will see a shift in how the retail industry is operated and structured.
The country is becoming a battleground for powerful multinationals and homegrown Indian companies, and the government has been pursuing e-commerce regulations to help protect local businesses and Indian consumers. But I think there will be a limit to how much they push. Modi has been an advocate of a “digital India,” and U.S.-led investments to sell to Indian consumers have been substantial.
Amazon has pledged to invest roughly $5 billion. Last year Walmart paid $16 billion for a majority stake in Flipkart, an upstart Indian e-commerce platform.
At a high level, the country’s retail market (very broadly defined to include everything from groceries to jewelry to apparel) is valued at roughly $800 billion today, with the bulk of that in traditional retail channels like neighborhood stores and produce markets, based on our data.
Companies like Amazon, Walmart and Reliance are all pursuing strategies that could ultimately restructure traditional distribution channels in India, reshaping how household staples and other items get from manufacturing plants to neighborhood stores.
This could translate into lower prices, more efficient supply chains and less waste — especially for food products. In theory, this could help curb inflation in India (historically an issue) and keep interest rates lower.
The financial sector has faced credit quality issues over the past several years. What’s your outlook for banks?
Our investment analysts in New World Fund remain positive on a few private sector banks, namely HDFC and Kotak Mahindra. These banks have grown rapidly over the past decade. They have top-notch management teams and quality loan underwriting standards. With loan issues bogging down some of the state-run banks and non-bank lenders, they should continue to gain market share.
The new bankruptcy law should strengthen the credit system and corporate governance. So far, it appears to be progressing well. Based on data we’ve seen, the average time to resolve a bad debt issue shrunk markedly to 310 days, with an average recovery rate of 49%. That compares with an average of 10 years and 22% recovery rate before the law took effect.
This bodes well for the banking sector and India’s economy.

Here to provide answers — as well as insights from past recessions — are economists Darrell Spence and Jared Franz and portfolio manager Joyce Gordon.
View transcript
Will McKenna: Today we're going to delve into the complex and often misunderstood realm of recessions. Now, if you're wondering why we decided to tackle this subject, the idea really came from you in our audience.
You've asked us lots of questions about recessions, and I'm literally looking at dozens of them here. Everything from, “When is the next recession coming?” to “How bad will it be?” to “What should I do in my portfolio to prepare for it?”
So, with that in mind, we decided to seek out some of the brightest minds at Capital on this topic and provide perspective — not predictions — into the difficult but inevitable periods of contraction in the U.S. economic cycle.
So, here’s what you’re going to learn in this episode. We'll discuss the relative impact of recessions compared to expansions; the key events that have triggered past downturns; what signals to watch out for, for the next recession; and then the steps that investors can take to prepare their portfolios for the next one, whenever it hits.
Now, before I introduce our three panelists today, I want to say a couple words about an exciting new feature we're introducing with this program. It's our free Guide to Recessions e-book. That's a companion piece, if you will, to today's discussion. And I'll say more about that later.
So, now without further ado, I want to introduce our three panelists. With me today are economists Darrell Spence and Jared Franz, who both cover the U.S. economy.
Darrell has 26 years of investment experience, all with Capital Group. Jared has 13 years of experience and four with Capital. And today we also have a very special guest: Joyce Gordon, who's a portfolio manager, who invests primarily in dividend-oriented stocks — those kind of stocks that have historically tended to hold up relatively better during times of economic distress. Joyce has been with Capital for 43 years. She is the principal investment officer of American Mutual Fund®, or what we call AMF. And let me just apologize to our listeners outside the U.S.: American Funds are not available outside the United States.
So, welcome, everybody. Appreciate you joining us. And let's jump right into it.
Darrell, I'm going to start with you and throw you a real softball. When exactly is the next recession going to start?
Darrell Spence: Well, that's a good question, Will. And maybe the best answer I can provide is that it's closer than it was yesterday but further away than it will be tomorrow. Look, I think one thing that is now somewhat common knowledge, but wasn't even as short as a year ago, is that recessions aren't dictated by how much time an economy has spent in an expansion.
Will McKenna: Right.
Darrell Spence: So, the average expansion has lasted 60 months, just over five years. And as of July, we'll be at 10 years. So, I want to give you a bit of a different way to think about how long this expansion has been, that goes just a little bit beyond the amount of time that's passed. So, in an average expansion, the economy grows to about 123% of the prior peak, in terms of real GDP. Right now we're at 119% of the prior peak. So, even though the expansion has been twice as long as the average, we still haven't even covered as much ground, in terms of economic growth, as we have in the average expansions of the past. So, that's kind of a complicated way to say we've been growing fairly slowly since coming out of the last recession.
But recessions are really about imbalances that build up in the system that need to be corrected. And you ultimately get late in the cycle and you enter into a Fed tightening phase or inflation starts to pick up. Or maybe even inventories get built up too rapidly. And something happens that triggers these imbalances, that ultimately cause the economy to turn down.
You know, we can't lie: We are late in the cycle. You have an unemployment rate that is arguably well below what most would consider the natural rate of unemployment. You're seeing the symptoms of that in rising wages. You're starting to see somewhat higher inflation; it's gradual but it has been moving higher over the past couple of years. And you have a Fed that, until recently, was in a tightening cycle. And we think the odds are more likely that they return to that tightening cycle than they go back into an easing cycle as we go through the remainder of 2019.
And all of those things have generally been precursors to recessions. If we look at things like where the unemployment rate is, when did the Fed start this tightening cycle, what is inflation doing, and we look out at some of the things we see that might be imbalances in the corporate debt markets or leveraged loan markets, our best guess on when we might get a recession as all of this plays out is starting sometime in 2020 or maybe 2021.
But again, there's a lot of uncertainty in that. A lot of it depends on whether the Fed restarts the tightening cycle, whether inflation continues to move up, as we suspect it will. But based on our analysis of history, where we are now, our conversations with analysts about where we see excesses in the system, that's our best guess.
Will McKenna: OK, great. So, not imminent but watching some of those imbalances. And what's interesting is it can be different things in different recessions that trigger different recessions. We'll come back to that.
You know, Jared, one of the things you've been putting together for us for the last couple years is this great chart that shows where we are relative to some of the other large developed and also emerging countries around the world. Talk a little bit about that: where you see us in the cycle, maybe relative to some of the other big economies out there.
Jared Franz: Yeah. I think, as Darrell pointed out, we do think we're late cycle. And we tend to divide the cycle into four parts: the expansion, the mid-cycle, the late cycle and then the inevitable recession. So, we think we're just entering that late cycle. The late cycles are interesting because there's no pattern. The average is, let's say, around nine months, maybe 12 months. But we've had late cycles that have lasted much longer, two years, as in the late '90s.
And so, we're thinking about what are the dynamics of this late cycle? How could it be different from other cycles? And so, to Darrell's point, it's not that we're predicting a downturn based on some type of formula. But we're looking at the dynamics.
When you look at the U.S. relative to other countries, we were ground zero of the crisis in '08 and '09. And then, we came out of it very quickly, through monetary policy, fiscal policy, recognizing losses on portfolios. We were able to come out of that recession relatively early. And then it was kind of the domino effect of the rest of the countries following us. Right?
And so you had Europe later; Japan, other countries following us by about a year or two. So, as a result, we've been progressing slowly along this cycle. So, we were the first to hit the cycle dynamics that we've been talking about. And now we have other countries like Europe — within Europe, countries like Germany — Japan, even China is looking more like a late-cycle economy.
And so, now we're saying, “Oh, well, the risks to the outlook are definitely more to the downside, to the extent that we are in this late cycle.” And the late cycle is not saying that we're going to enter a recession. It just says that the expansion is older. It's a little weaker than it has been in the past, and we don't have those kind of strong mid-cycle dynamics that we used to back in '15 and '16 or even earlier.
Will McKenna: Got it. So, late-cycle clock starts ticking a little bit. But it can run to different lengths. I do want to return to this idea of why you guys are seeing it maybe out a little bit from here and what are the imbalances that are starting to creep up.
But before I do that, Joyce let's bring you in. Would love to hear … you've done this for a few years. You've managed money through a number of economic declines, and I'm sure bear markets as well. How do you think about positioning your own portfolio — the ones that you manage in the funds you manage? And are you doing anything differently now, or is this anything you're concerned about at the moment?
Joyce Gordon: Yes. You know, since we are in the late stages of the cycle, what we see is a very strong employment picture, with a very low unemployment rate. We start to see wages move up. And it's at a time when order rates at companies start to come down a little bit or at least level off. And so it makes the prospects of an earnings surprise, or an earnings miss, more likely. So, you end up with more volatility in the market.
When I think about the volatility in the market, there still is a lot of room for the market to go up. Because, as Darrell and Jared mentioned, the recovery could go on for a long period of time.
Will McKenna: Right.
Joyce Gordon: But I want to be prepared, and so I try to invest in companies that have lower leverage, so they don't have as much debt to repay if earnings suffer a little bit. I try to invest in the companies that are very solid, and also the ones that have a pretty solid revenue stream, even if we go into recession.
I'm thinking about the utility companies. About food retailers, defense contractors, health care companies and even some real estate investment trusts. And you want to be very careful of investing in companies that are involved in areas of discretionary spending. It could be auto sales or anything related to travel, be it airlines or hotels. And then also financial companies. Banks make loans, and when you go into recession, a lot of those loans go bad. And so, you have rise in credit losses. So, it's prudent to stay away from some of those if you really think a recession is coming at some point.
But it really comes down to doing the research on companies — one by one, out seeing companies, talking to managements, seeing what the order trends are. And then we have this backdrop of what typically happens during a recession and which companies typically do better. And that's helpful.
Will McKenna: That's great. And those classic defensive areas that you were talking about. Let me follow up and talk a little bit about 2008 and the Great Recession.
Joyce Gordon: Yeah.
Will McKenna: I think [it’s] still very much on the minds of our audience. When we look at the questions we get, people were really so scarred by that. That's kind of the anchor or the framework they bring to thinking about recessions today.
You lived through that, you invested through that. What lessons did you pull out of that? I mean, you were talking about companies. That was the recession where there was nowhere to hide —
Joyce Gordon: Right.
Will McKenna: — so to speak. But there were a handful of companies — Amgen, Hasbro, McDonald's, Walmart, those types of companies — that were positive that year. What lessons did you pull from that period in particular?
Joyce Gordon: Even going back to the 1987 big decline in the market, what was true of both of those time frames was, you wanted to avoid companies with a lot of leverage. Companies with a lot of debt service that they have to deal with are subject to problems of outside influences, of credit rating agencies that force their hand and make them cut their dividend, so that they can maintain investment grade. And that would hurt the stock price if they cut the dividend at a time when you're going through the problems. That was one big thing I learned.
Another thing I learned was to really pay attention to what people are doing. And, you know, going into the Great Recession, we had the Sandlers, who owned Golden West Financial in California. And this was their baby. This was their savings and loan company, that they built. And I thought they would never sell it. Right before the peak, they sold it to a bank. And I think that I should've paid more attention to that — that they were nervous about mortgages. And they were nervous about the state of the bank.
And another thing that happened back then was Washington Mutual Savings Bank, based in Seattle. They issued a proxy proposal that would change the management bonus structure and take out any loan losses from the impact from the management incentive plan, so that they were being incentivized by volume, not quality. And that was another telltale sign that something horrible was coming.
And so as I look around now, I don't see a lot of those types of things going on. But what I do see is some companies that have typically increased their dividend every single year, over this last year [they] have not. And the ones that have not are the ones with a lot of leverage. And so they're kind of worried about paying down their debt and not increasing the dividend. And we're seeing that with some of the food companies. And so, that confirms that we're in the later stages of the cycle, and that sales growth is tougher and that companies are focusing on paying down debt.
Will McKenna: That's great. I even remember you, I think in that year, talking about some of those canaries in the coal mine —
Joyce Gordon: Right.
Will McKenna: — and you know, in hindsight, could've been those early warning signals.
Joyce Gordon: Right.
Will McKenna: That's great. You guys were talking about some of the different imbalances, and maybe in different recessions, there are different ones. Talk a little bit more about that, Darrell, in terms of what you guys may be seeing today in those imbalances. And then, compare and contrast that to some of the other recessions you've studied through the history we've looked at.
Darrell Spence: Yeah. Well, it was noted before, what ultimately pushes the economy into a recession can differ. But there's somewhat of a difference between a catalyst for a recession and then what we would call an accelerant. The catalyst causes the economy to slow; maybe it's not the reason that growth actually turns negative. But then there's the accelerant that ultimately comes in and really causes a lot of problems.
So, right now the most likely catalyst is something that's pretty traditional. We thought it would be an ongoing Fed tightening cycle. And the accelerant would be a lot of the stuff that's happening in the corporate debt market. So, Joyce has already alluded to a lot of the leverage that's out there. But some of the top-down accounting research we've done shows that, almost as aggressively as they were in the late 1990s, firms have been borrowing not to basically fund productive capital expenditures, but to do stock buybacks; to pay dividends; to do M&A; and basically, in some cases, financial engineering, which makes their balance sheets look a lot healthier. It makes their earnings look a lot healthier. And this is not every company, obviously, but there are some that have been more aggressive about it than others.
And that's fine, as long as rates remain low or the lending markets are willing to continue to lend money to you. If one or both of those things changes, those business models start to fall apart. You can start to see those companies get into trouble. Maybe they start to lay off some people. Maybe they don't do a capex plan that they had planned on doing. And you can see how that can start to spiral through the system.
So, right now, I think that is probably where we see the greatest imbalance. And again it's not across every single company that's out there. But the numbers in aggregate have grown to a size that we think it's something that we need to keep a pretty close eye on.
Will McKenna: Right. And, to your initial comments, why 2020? Why 2021? What's leading you to think that that's the time frame we're looking at?
Darrell Spence: Well, a lot of it has to do with inflation picking up, the economy at full employment and the Fed continuing on a tightening cycle — which, over the past couple of weeks, now seems to be a little bit in doubt. We think the Fed is definitely in wait-and-see mode. But we think ultimately, economic conditions will probably bring them back into a tightening mode — not an aggressive one, but a tightening mode. But admittedly, they're in kind of a sweet spot right now. They've achieved full employment. Inflation certainly isn't a problem, even though it's right at about, or slightly above, their target, depending on what measure you look at.
The question is whether that balance can last. And history suggests that it's very difficult to maintain this balance at this stage of the economic cycle with this amount of resource utilization, whether it be labor market utilization or capacity utilization in the economy.
But, you know, that is the one thing: that if for some reason we don't see inflation percolate up a little bit more and the Fed doesn't get back into the game, we still think these imbalances will have to be dealt with at some point. But the catalyst that ultimately sets off those as accelerants, maybe that's 2021, instead of 2020.
Will McKenna: Got it. I know one of the things that you guys put together in this guide is a comparison of recessions and expansions. And this was very eye-opening for me. But Jared, maybe you can talk to this point — and when we studied these cycles back to, I guess, 1950, looking at recessions — and put them in perspective relative to expansions for us.
Jared Franz: Sure. So, I think, hopefully, what people take away from the chart is that the economy is overwhelmingly not in recession. And so, the typical state of the economy is in an expansionary period. As Darrell pointed out earlier, we do have imbalances that crop up. And this is part of human nature and the psychology of markets, that you go into tech in the '90s, you go into housing in the last cycle, maybe it's corporate debt in this cycle.
And so there tends to be an overshoot in these imbalances. And so, the variety of recessions that we've gotten in the last two, and what we expect for this one, is likely in this imbalance category. And that differs from prior recessions. So, in the '40s and '50s, those recessions were very different. If you think about the economy in those time periods, there wasn't a big tech sector. It was very manufacturing-based. And so, you'd get these inventory-cycle type recessions where manufacturers would discover that they had way too much inventory. And they had to cut inventories, and production would go down. And that would cause these cycles earlier on.
We're not there anymore. And that really makes it difficult for the timing, because you could calibrate an inventory cycle, a manufacturing cycle relatively easily. You could see the data.
Now you have these kind of imbalances. When does the market start waking up to these imbalances? Your guess is as good as mine. I don't know. But what we’ve found is that, even if you go back to the last cycle with housing ... I remember being in graduate school, and we had a seminar on, “Is the housing cycle a bubble?” In '06, right? This was well before the recession actually happened.
Will McKenna: Just how long does it then take to get recognized and burst?
Jared Franz: Right. And then it, these, the imbalances can kind of fester and continue —
Will McKenna: Right.
Jared Franz: — until someone wakes up in the morning and says, ""You know what? This house is actually really expensive relative to my income."" And then you have this kind of domino effect. So, I think we're looking at the same type of situation here, where we can kind of point and look at these imbalances. It's hard to figure out where the trigger is, but we do feel like a trigger will come eventually. And whether it's tomorrow or in a year or even farther than that, we're monitoring that.
Will McKenna: Got it. And we'll get into some of the signals you guys watch closely.
Jared Franz: Yeah.
Will McKenna: Joyce, I want to come back to you. Let me just read a couple things off this chart that struck me. “Over the last 65 years, the U.S. has been in official recession less than 15% of all months.” And then, when we compared them, the average expansion is 67 months, while the average recession is 11 months. And just the GDP growth, cumulative growth, 24.3% in an expansion and –1.8% in a recession. Not at all to diminish the real human cost and pain of a recession, but I know when I saw this, it gave me certainly a sense of reassurance. Oh, OK. It took the temperature down thinking about recessions.
You know, Joyce, let's talk a little bit about the stock market vis-à-vis recessions. You mentioned some of the types of companies and interesting examples from that period in kind of '07, leading up to '08. Where we sit today, what are the types of companies that you think are well-positioned to weather the next downturn, whenever it occurs? And maybe talk about two or three examples. And of course, these are not ... at Capital Ideas, we do not give specific investment recommendations. But what are the kinds of things that are on your mind there?
Joyce Gordon: Well, I think, first and foremost, it's really important to stay invested during this period, because as you say, only 15% of the time we're in recession. And you can get a lot of your appreciation late in the cycle. And no one knows exactly when the cycle's going to hit, so I like to be participating in the market all the way, and then I just adjust a little bit around that.
So, the kinds of things that should hold up well would be the utilities in the U.S. And if you pick a plain vanilla utility like American Electric Power, if you go back and look at every decline in the market of 10% or more going back to 1990, we've had 13 instances when the market has declined by 10% or more. And in all 13 cases, American Electric Power did better than the market. It lost value absolute, but relative to the market, it did quite a bit better.
Those are the kinds of things that I would look for. And I would also look for companies with solid dividends. And not only just a high dividend, but a sustainable dividend. You want to make sure that through a cycle, that the company will be able to pay that dividend. The worst thing that can happen is you get part way through, and the company has to cut the dividend, and then you lose your support for the stock. And so you lose a lot of value there.
Will McKenna: And that's what really happened in the '08, '09 period, wasn't it?
Joyce Gordon: Yes.
Will McKenna: So, how are you taking that experience to what you're thinking about today, and what are the types of companies that you think have the balance sheet strength to make it through?
Joyce Gordon: Right. It would be focusing on companies with lower leverage. That's the main one. Focusing on companies that have a pretty good revenue stream, almost regardless of what's going on in the economy. And those would be the utilities. Food retailers tend to do quite well. Costco and Walmart tend to do better than the market in these declines. Even a company like Hormel. They have a decent dividend, around 2%, and they grow that dividend maybe 10%-ish a year. And very low leverage; sometimes they're net cash. And it just holds up quite well.
Will McKenna: People are still going to be going to Walmart, picking up the things they need. They're still going to be —
Joyce Gordon: Right.
Will McKenna: — making ham sandwiches with —
Joyce Gordon: Exactly.
Will McKenna: — with Hormel. You know, it's those kinds of things. Boring is beautiful in this phase. One of the questions we get from the audience is the relationship between the stock market and recessions. The stock market typically is a leading indicator. How long does it roll over ahead of a recession? So, you guys have studied this. What are some of the things we ought to be thinking about relative to stock market and recession?
Darrell Spence: Um, it doesn't do well during a recession. I don't think that's going to be a surprise to anybody, and in fact —
Will McKenna: News flash.
Darrell Spence: — it peaks about six months, on average, before the recession starts. So, of course, trying to figure out when an unknowable event is going to start and then flash back six months from that to implement your portfolio strategy is very difficult. So, as Joyce mentioned, it's probably good just to stay invested.
But I think we think about the market from a little bit of a different perspective. The reason recessions aren't good for the stock market is because they're not good for earnings. And ultimately, earnings will go down. How much the stock market goes down along with those earnings really depends on what valuations are, where you start, where you end up. And a lot of that depends on the interest rate environment.
So, as we look out, if we know for sure — and we don't — but if we suspect a recession is coming in 2020, it's probably not too early to start thinking about [the] defensive positioning you would do, given these kind of six months, average six-month lead time between the market peaking and the start of a recession. But I think, even if I don't know that a recession is coming, Joyce alluded to some of the late-cycle things that ultimately put downward pressure on profit growth. You have rising labor cost. You have generally slowing top-line growth, often rising interest expense. And all of that comes together to put downward pressure on profit margins.
So, 2018 was a fantastic year for profits largely because of a tax cut, but also because of robust economic growth. 2019, we expect, will be a lot more subdued. 2020, if we do start to see more significant economic weakness, it would not surprise us to see earnings go down. And that's in an environment where the market is already arguably fully valued. So, as I look out, recession or no recession, I still think it can be somewhat of a challenging environment, just because I don't expect to get a lot of earnings growth. But if I do have some level of conviction that there is a recession coming, I know earnings are going down. And there's not any type of valuation cushion, at least in our framework, that's going to keep the market from going down along with it.
Will McKenna: Well, speaking of, maybe, a more defensive positioning at some point, let's talk about bonds and the role that bonds can play in a portfolio. I know you're not a bond manager, Joyce, but in the chair you sit in, [you] obviously have some perspective on this. But what role should fixed income investments play at this part of the cycle? And how would an investor think about that?
Joyce Gordon: Yeah. They can definitely help stabilize a portfolio. Having some bond exposure just helps lower the volatility overall in your portfolio. And even though, if you were thinking that interest rates may rise slightly over time, it still makes it an interesting prospect to invest in bonds. There's a saying that a bad day in the equity market is much worse than a bad day in the bond market, and that bonds move a little bit when stocks move a lot. And so, you really can use them [to] tamper down your volatility, and with some reasonable yield. And I use cash that way, too, actually. Now that cash has a yield of about 2.25%, I do have a fair amount of cash in my portfolios that will act to lower the volatility. And also, I'll have cash available; if the market does correct, I'll be able to get into something else that I want to buy.
Will McKenna: And so for you, personally, does that mean 10%? 20%? What's a ballpark sense of what that is in your slice?
Joyce Gordon: Yeah. A normal level of cash for me is probably 6% or 7%. And right now in AMF, in American Mutual Fund, I am at about 16%, 17% cash.
Will McKenna: OK.
Joyce Gordon: And it's partly because we are so late in the cycle and I'm getting nervous about valuations. And American Mutual Fund is a unique mutual fund that has preservation of principal in its objectives, so I really try to protect in that fund. And I know I do give up some of the return, but I'm really trying to protect shareholders.
In the other places where I manage money, I am more around the 10%-ish cash, which is higher than normal for me, but not off the charts.
Will McKenna: So, let me just follow up. Let's get into it a little bit with American Mutual Fund. And again, I need to apologize to our friends outside of the U.S., who can't access the American Funds. You're the PIO on that fund. It is known for seeking resilience in times like this. It sounds like you and your slice of the fund — and of course, we have the multiple manager system, where everybody has a slice — have gotten more defensive. Talk a little bit more and take us a little deeper into that. So, 16% cash. And the types of companies you might hold, have you made changes there? Give us a flavor of that.
Joyce Gordon: Yeah. I think all the managers in American Mutual Fund are really looking through their portfolio with a fine-tooth comb, because we know we are later in the cycle now. And as I mentioned earlier, we run this screen on every company in the S&P 500 and look at how it did in each of the downturns of 10% or more going back to 1990. And so, we get the whole array of companies that always do well, typically do well, never do well. And it's a good starting point to start asking questions.
It's not that you would buy, make an investment, based on that. But then, based with that knowledge, we can go to the analysts and talk. You know, “Is there anything unique going on at the company that's going to have it behave differently this time?” And we really do try to go through and make sure that we are protecting shareholders.
Will McKenna: And I don't know if you are seeing any themes across the managers in the portfolio when you look at the top 20 holdings in the fund. You mentioned as a theme lower leverage. Any other themes that come to the fore as you think about top holdings in the fund?
Joyce Gordon: It's interesting. We had a portfolio managers meeting this week for American Mutual Fund. And we look at a lot of different metrics. And we have a lot of different styles of portfolio managers in the fund invested in financials. I think I had the lowest exposure at 3% of the portfolio, but someone else had 20-plus percent in financials.
Will McKenna: What was their rationale?
Joyce Gordon: Well, they weren't invested so much in traditional banking, but they were focused on areas that don't have the loan-loss problem. So, it could be exchanges and some of the trust banks where they're just doing custody, where they wouldn't have exposure to loan losses. Everyone's doing different things, but we're all focused on the same outcome, [which] is how to participate in the market, have an above-average current yield and protect their principal.
Will McKenna: That's great. I love that example. Any others come to mind for you as you think about the variety of styles inside the fund?
Joyce Gordon: Some people are very interested in health care, because health care typically holds up extremely well. But we don't know if there are any drug pricing changes that are going to come down, so we have portfolio managers on either side of that argument, where they're concerned about it or they're not.
And you can go through each industry, and we have a big variance in opinion around what is attractive.
Will McKenna: Interesting. Of course, health care, too. That big innovation cycle that we seem to be going through as well.
Joyce Gordon: Right.
Will McKenna: OK. Thank you.

Let me come back to you guys now. And I know you've been studying, Jared, for some time the different signals that you guys watch very closely going into a recession, whatever the indicators are. And of course, there are many of them. I know in this guide that you all put together, we pulled out five that we felt were particularly useful tools for us. But talk a little bit about some of the key ones, and what are the ones you're watching, Jared?
Jared Franz: Sure. So, there's probably a thousand actual ways to monitor whether we're going into a recession or not. We tried to pick a couple indicators that we thought worked in other cycles. And there's an old quip in economics that “cycle is housing.” And so there's a housing indicator in there.
And so, why does that work? Housing, even though it's a small share of the overall economy relative to the consumer or even manufacturing, it punches kind of over its weight in terms of impact, because the tentacles in housing are pretty broad. So, it's the laborers, the person who buys the house, the leverage that's involved in housing. And so it has much broader impact than just buying that house.
And so the housing indicator is one. If that's falling by at least 10 or 15%, then that tends to be a good indicator that the economy's starting to lose momentum, lose steam.
Another one we like to look at is just the labor market. This has worked in prior cycles, and we think it's going to work again. And it's just to look at where the unemployment rate is relative to kind of the equilibrium unemployment rate. And so, when you're under that equilibrium, you tend to be generating a lot of tension in the economy, tension in the labor market. Wages start going up, and that creates that wedge for the Fed to start raising rates.
So, when we look historically at other cycles, it tends to be that once the unemployment rate moves roughly 30 or even 50 basis points higher, that is almost a slam-dunk type indicator to say [that] the economy, and the labor market specifically, is losing momentum. And it doesn't happen that it just moves higher and then kind of moves back lower because the Fed's lowering rates, let's say, in response. It tends to be that it moves and it keeps on moving, and you're going into that recession area.
Will McKenna: It gains momentum. Yeah.
Jared Franz: It gains momentum in that recessionary condition. So, those are a couple that we're monitoring. There's also financial indicators like the yield curve that we think are important. They have tended to be important historically. We think they're important again. And so, we take that all together, and it's not one, two or three that we're watching, but it's kind of this mosaic of indicators to say, ""OK, why is this happening? And what does it tell us about the type of recession or even the timing of the recession?""
Will McKenna: Got it. So maybe … the way we wrote it in here is, ""The inverted yield curve sounds like an elaborate gymnastics routine."" But to the uninitiated, I know we had the two fives invert briefly, relatively recently, but I guess the two 10s is the more typical signal. Darrell, can you give us, first, “The Inverted Yield Curve for Dummies,” and then where you guys see us on that dimension?
Darrell Spence: Sure.
Will McKenna: And why that’s been such a reliable signal.
Darrell Spence: Very simply put, the inverted yield curve is when long-term interest rates are lower than short-term interest rates or short-term interest rates are higher than long-term interest rates, which is not normally the case, because you tend to get paid a little bit more for lending money over longer periods of time.
And the reason that comes about is because the bond market gets scared about something and starts to anticipate a Fed easing cycle. Conversely, but similarly, the Fed tightens too much, at least according to the bond market, and you get the short end of the curve yielding more than the longer end of the curve under the expectation that eventually the shorter rates will ultimately come down.
There's a legitimate argument about whether it's a reflection of something else or an actual cause of a recession. And the reason it might be a cause of a recession is, you can think if you were a bank and you pay your depositors in short-term interest rates and you collect longer term interest rates on your loans, obviously having the shorter number be higher than the longer number isn't good for your profit margins. That starts to put a crimp on lending, which ultimately leads to a contraction in growth.
Jared Franz: If you look at what the yield curve does over a cycle, it typically steepens, and then it flattens, and then it inverts. And what we've done is take the yield curve and just map it over our own indicators of where we are early, mid- and late cycle. And it ends up being really whacky that they’re almost perfectly correlated.
Darrell Spence: Yeah.
Jared Franz: So, what the yield curve is telling you is that you're late in the cycle. What our economic indicators are telling you is that you're late in the cycle. So, they're kind of saying the same thing. And we think it's not unusual, it wouldn't be unusual, for the yield curve to have an inversion in the next year or two if we're right on our recessionary time frame.
Darrell Spence: The inversion of the yield curve that got so much attention recently was just this small smidge right in the middle of it. Everyone has gotten so focused on the yield curve that inversion at any point along the curve generated a lot of excitement. But the reality is, it's generally the long versus the short end that needs to invert to cause a recession signal, and that hasn't happened yet.
And even when it does happen, the time between that inversion and the ultimate start of a recession is pretty varied. I think it ranges anywhere from a couple of months to almost as long as two years.
We have another framework that we've looked at that, I think, is somewhat interesting. And that is, monetary policy becomes tight when the fed funds rate or the target rate rises above the low that the long rate reached over the course of the prior cycle. That low was roughly 2%, a little bit below, so when the fed funds rate broke above 2%, that is the point that we could start to feel that monetary policy was getting tight. And the reason for that is twofold.
One, as rates are rising, and if long rates are rising during a Fed tightening cycle, which is normally what happens, borrowers can still roll down the curve. They're taking more duration risk, but they can still take advantage of lower rates by shortening the duration of their borrowing. Once short rates get above the low that long rates ever hit, that option is completely gone.
And similarly, on the lending side, banks tend to pay short rates, but their longer term assets are yielding that rate that was locked in over the course of the cycle. And so, their cost and their income stream starts to move adversely, and they become a little bit more reluctant to lend. So, borrowers lose some borrowing options, lenders become a little bit more reluctant to lend, and that's the point at which monetary policy starts to bite the economy.
You know, we've hit that. But again, the time between hitting that criterion and ultimately a recession can be pretty varied, but we do know that once we've hit it, we've ultimately always had a recession.
Will McKenna: Right. Let me come back to this discussion of the Fed. We touched on it at various points during the discussion. Clearly, there's been some different signals from the Fed recently, but where do we stand today? Where do you guys see us going from here in terms of the rising rate cycle? Are we pausing? Are we continuing?
Darrell Spence: I don't think they're done, personally. And I think that is a function of analyzing where we think the economy is, the levels of resource utilization that are occurring — whether it be on the labor side or on the capacity utilization side — and the belief that we think inflation will move higher.
We don't think it's going to be a big inflation problem or an inflation blowout, but most measures of core inflation are just about what the Fed says their target is: 2%. There's probably some willingness to let it drift above 2%. If the economy continues along the track that it's on, it'll probably continue to drift higher above 2%. Now, where that becomes uncomfortable enough for them to start to re‑initiate higher rates, it's hard to know.
But we think those fundamentals are going to continue as we go through 2019. And so, as we get into the second half of the year, the unemployment rate might be lower than it is right now, inflation continuing to tick higher, we think the Fed will probably be back into a tightening cycle.
I think the market has somewhat misinterpreted what they've been saying. I think the market has interpreted “data dependent” as done, and we think “data dependent” means data dependent, and they're going to wait and see what the economy throws at them to decide what they're going to do next. And the market has essentially priced out any more Fed tightening over the course of this entire cycle. We think maybe that's a little optimistic, again, given the developments that we see both as it relates to their dual mandates of low unemployment and stable inflation.
Will McKenna: Joyce, as a stock picker, how do you think about what the Fed is up to? How closely did you watch that? I mean, where are you in this debate, and how do you see it unfolding relative to what you're trying to achieve?
Joyce Gordon: Right. I was pretty nervous about what they were doing, going into late last year, with quite a few increases coming. And I thought that it was going to bring about the next recession at some point sooner rather than later. And given that they've backed off it a little bit and are slowing down, to me it probably means that the recovery can last a little bit longer. I agree with Darrell that they're not done, and it will be data dependent, and so they probably will come back. But I think, for now, it's kind of eased off the pressure. So, I'm not doing anything too much differently in my portfolio.
Will McKenna: Excellent. Let me wrap it up and maybe just hear some kind of summary thoughts from each of you. We've talked a lot about recessions, different parts of the cycle. Kind of sum up your views on this topic, any other insights that occur to you.
Jared Franz: Yeah. I think, at least from my end, like we said at the beginning, recessions are not common. We're usually in expansion. And as we think about the fundamentals of the economy, the U.S. economy, for the medium and long term over the next decade or two, I think it's important to remember, really, that the fundamentals are perhaps the best of developed economies, and maybe even among young economies, too. That we have a great innovation and technological system in place — the Googles and Microsofts and Amazons that we produce here — unlike many other countries.
Even though our population growth rate is slowing a bit, it still is pretty rocking relative to a lot of other countries’, especially developed-market economies. So, when I take those couple things and say, “Well, look, we're going to go into recession eventually; it's going to hurt a little bit. But, you know, we're going to come out of this in better shape,” I think, than we are during the recession.
Will McKenna: Great. Darrell?
Darrell Spence: I guess I would like to say I think that's the first time I've heard “rocking” used in economic commentary. So, hey ...
Will McKenna: Yeah. That qualifies as a pretty radical thing for an economist to say. So, “rocking.”
Darrell Spence: I guess I would echo a lot of what Jared says. And I would also note that none of this is new. I mean, the whole process that we talked about — about imbalances building and economies becoming tight and late cycle and human behavior creating more imbalances.
Will McKenna: Just a natural part of the cycle.
Darrell Spence: The characters may change, but the storyline is exactly the same and ultimately we get through. And I think one of the things that the U.S. does have going for it is its flexibility. Earlier in this conversation, Jared alluded to “the banks take the losses, companies go out of business.” That's not to say that it is not painful; it's very painful for those who are involved and those who are exposed to it. But ultimately, the economy comes out much healthier than it was when it went in, and you can see around the world other areas that haven't necessarily taken that short-term pain to correct the imbalances and to let the survivors survive and the ones that are less healthy go.
It's less painful in the short run, but ultimately they pay a very large price for that in terms of lost growth, lost output, lost opportunity over the longer term.
So, we don't know if it's going to be 2020 or 2021. We pretty much know that it will happen at some point, simply because that's the nature of the U.S. economy. It's allowed to expand perhaps beyond its potential, and then ultimately, it has to contract back down to its potential — and then we're off again. But at the end of the day, that seems to be — as hard as it is to believe — that boom/bust cycle can ultimately serve the longer term outlook much better than trying to suppress or avoid it entirely.
Will McKenna: Great. Joyce, what about from you?
Joyce Gordon: Just the longer we get in this economic recovery, the more attention that we pay to dividend sustainability and all the details and making sure that the companies are on the right path. And that we think that there is some room for appreciation if the recession comes later than sooner.
And also, on the fixed income part of it, not all fixed income instruments are created equal. At this point in the cycle, what becomes interesting is maybe some of the Treasury bonds that give you a lot of credit protection, and probably the shorter term in nature [bonds], where you're not taking a lot of interest rate risk. And then, later on, when we start coming out of said recession — if we ever get it — then you start thinking about higher yield opportunities that are more racy. But at this point in the cycle, no.
Will McKenna: So, so lower your risk profile in your bonds.
Joyce Gordon: Yeah.
Will McKenna: Use them, as you mentioned earlier, as a diversification from equities —
Joyce Gordon: Right.
Will McKenna: — to dampen that volatility, and then maybe take on more credit risk later when it turns.
Well, that was fantastic. Thank you so much. It’s been an incredibly informative and engaging conversation. Thanks again to Darrell, Jared, and Joyce for sharing your views on this important topic with our audience.

275,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/china-economic-slowdown.html,Beware China's slowing economy,China,"March 6, 2019","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
China’s economic growth rate has declined to a nearly 30-year low.
The U.S.-China trade dispute has hurt import/export activities in both countries.
Despite these headwinds, select companies should continue to thrive as consumption grows in the world’s most populous country.
The outlook for China’s economy in 2019 and beyond hinges on two crucial questions: Will Beijing unleash a new stimulus program to help counteract a clear deceleration trend? And, if so, will it be large enough to make a difference?
So far, equity markets are taking a positive view. Chinese stocks rallied nearly 15% during the first two months of the year, as measured by the MSCI China Investable Market Index. After a dismal 2018, investors appear to be hopeful for an economic rebound, coupled with a near-term agreement to avoid a full-blown U.S.-China trade war.
We may indeed see a trade agreement soon, but in my view, China’s economy will continue to weaken as stimulus measures fall short of market expectations and China’s traditional investment-led recoveries of the past fail to materialize. Yes, I’m saying it will be different this time.
Simply put, this cycle is unique in the decades-long history of China’s remarkable economic rise. Major segments of the economy are slowing in a coordinated fashion — housing, exports, manufacturing, consumer spending and business confidence alike. A bit more spending on railways isn’t going to reverse that momentum. It will take time for this cycle to play out.
Taking a step back and looking at the big picture, China’s growth rate is slowing because of major long-term trends in the economy, such as a declining workforce and lower productivity growth. This is the inevitable maturing process that occurs when an “emerging market” essentially outgrows that label. Add to that more cyclical factors — such as the government’s deleveraging efforts with State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), a crackdown on the shadow banking system, and attempts to cool the housing market — and all of it puts a crimp on short-term growth.
Stimulus minimus
Moreover, there appears to be no desire in Beijing to replicate the massive government stimulus measures launched in 2015–16, which boosted the economy and sent Chinese stocks soaring in 2017. The worry today is that another huge stimulus injection would cause the housing market to further skyrocket into bubble territory and exacerbate China’s daunting debt challenge. We’ve already seen a small stimulus package — in the form of minor tax cuts and lower reserve requirements for banks — but it’s not enough to move the needle significantly.
One key economic metric that I follow closely is the rate of credit growth, as it tends to be a reliable leading indicator. Year-over-year growth in credit, the lifeblood of any economy, has been experiencing a powerful downward trend since 2010. My estimate shows it moving up a bit in 2019 but, again, not enough to drastically change the slowing pace of China’s GDP growth.
GDP growth estimate
Keep in mind, China’s economy — according to official government numbers — is still growing at an annual pace of 6.6%. That is a far cry, however, from the double-digit growth of a decade ago. (I am not going to delve into the reliability of the government’s economic statistics. Let’s just say, from here on, these are my own estimates.) In my view, China’s GDP growth will decline further in the years ahead, based on one of two scenarios outlined below.
For the record, my growth estimates were more optimistic a few years ago, based on a series of market reforms promised by government leaders, including reducing the dominant role of SOEs and fostering greater entrepreneurship in the private sector. Unfortunately, even though the government repeated these goals earlier this week, progress on these and other reforms has been largely disappointing.
Scenario 1: Reform restarts
China’s economic growth will slow to roughly 5% on average over the next five to six years, assuming at least some level of significant progress is made on the reform front. This reform-based scenario could benefit from a favorable compromise in U.S.-China trade negotiations, since it might give officials the opening they need to push through more aggressive market-oriented measures.
Scenario 2: Little reform
In this scenario, growth slows to 3%, in my view, principally due to negative overall productivity growth. Essentially, the productivity gains generated by innovative technology companies such as Alibaba and Tencent would be erased by loss-making SOEs and other government-oriented vehicles.
A mix of these two scenarios over the next few years is likely, in my view. Facing cyclical downturns, Beijing will try to do a bit more reform but will likely pull back from the most important steps. An average real growth rate of 4% through 2025 wouldn’t surprise me.
A continuing trade battle with the U.S. could hurt. We’ve already seen a significant dip in Chinese trade during the latter half of 2018, although the numbers have bounced back a bit early this year. The hit to confidence among the Chinese private sector has far outweighed the tariffs themselves. The U.S. also has suffered billions in lost trade and higher prices for its consumers. So both parties have a big incentive to at least reach a near-term deal that reduces existing tariffs and perhaps opens up additional limited trade opportunities on both sides of the Pacific. We may find out as early as this week.
Stock selection is key.
Although China’s slowing growth reduces the effect of a macroeconomic tailwind, it does not diminish investment opportunities that may be identified through bottom-up, fundamental, company-by-company research. Investors with a cautious and selective approach may find compelling opportunities among secular growth companies inside China, as well as multinationals that do business in China, such as Apple, Nike and Starbucks.
Select opportunities may be found among domestic and foreign companies that offer financial and travel services to China’s growing middle class, or innovative technology firms that design and manufacture semiconductor components for mobile devices and industrial automation.
In the fourth quarter, a number of American multinational companies warned of slowing revenue growth from China, and those reports contributed to a sharp selloff in global markets. That is something to keep in mind, but so are the long-term prospects for selling smartphones, tennis shoes and coffee in the world’s most populous country.
Among China-based publicly traded companies, aggregate valuations are certainly more attractive today than they were in 2017. Investors may also want to consider the implications if China further opens up to foreign companies as part of any future trade agreements.
In addition, China’s Stock Connect program has made it easier in recent years for international investors to buy into domestic A-share companies. Chinese software firms, for instance, are beginning to gain traction in the domestic market, and the fight is on to provide cloud-based services. A U.S.-China trade agreement might also boost protections for intellectual property, which would benefit the strongest domestic firms in this sector, as well as multinationals operating in China.
As always, selectivity and deep research are the keys to identifying these opportunities, especially against a challenging economic backdrop.

276,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/brexit-outlook.html,Brexit outlook: What British uncertainty means for markets,Brexit,"February 5, 2019","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
After two years of intense negotiations, a delay in the Brexit process appears likely.
High levels of uncertainty are expected to diminish U.K. trade and economic growth.
Companies with exposure to the domestic economy face the greatest potential risks.
Multinationals with broad-based revenue sources could fare relatively better.
With a decision on Brexit just a few weeks away, the fog of uncertainty surrounding the situation is thicker than ever. The stakes for the U.K. economy and markets are high and, at the moment, a number of potential outcomes remain on the table.
The deadline for the U.K.’s long-awaited withdrawal from the European Union is March 29. And yet the path forward is no more certain today than it was in the summer of 2016, when British voters narrowly approved a referendum calling for this historic decoupling. So far, the British pound sterling has suffered most of the consequences, falling roughly 11% against the U.S. dollar.
Between now and the end of March, the consequences could be even more severe if U.K. and EU leaders cannot agree on a reasonable withdrawal plan. The British Parliament rejected one such plan by a wide margin last month. That defeat has triggered unprecedented political uncertainty.
In our view, there are three plausible scenarios that may play out over the next few weeks. We rank them here in order of likelihood:
1. U.K. and EU leaders agree to extend the deadline. 
A delay is nearly unavoidable at this point because there isn’t much time left to renegotiate the terms of withdrawal. While some EU leaders have insisted they are not willing to give the U.K. more time, they may have no other option. If the U.K. leaves without an agreement — the so-called “no deal” Brexit — then virtually everyone loses. (See scenario #3.) Additional time opens up more options, which could lead to a number of other outcomes.
2. Another consequential vote decides Britain’s fate.
A new vote is coming. What’s not certain, however, is who will cast that consequential vote. Depending on the length of the delay, several options are on the table. These include another parliamentary vote on an amended withdrawal agreement, a general election that may reconfigure the House of Commons, or even a second nationwide referendum that could reopen the entire Brexit question. We think an amended withdrawal is the most likely path.
3. The U.K. abruptly leaves in a no deal Brexit.
This would be the most difficult outcome. And it would come with the highest level of uncertainty since it would mean that the U.K./EU relationship has broken down. If it were to happen, the U.K. would revert to World Trade Organization rules governing international commerce, severely limiting the free flow of goods, services and people to and from the U.K.
Under a no deal Brexit, some independent estimates suggest there would be a steep decline in trade between the U.K. and its closest EU neighbors: Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany. This scenario almost certainly would lead to a further slide in the value of the pound and a sharp selloff in the shares of companies that are highly exposed to the domestic U.K. economy or trade with the EU.
Where do we go from here?
Once we move past the near-term challenges described above, the medium- and long-term implications are more quantifiable. We believe the U.K. will indeed leave the EU, if not on March 29 then at some point in the near future. The extent of the economic impact will depend on how closely the U.K. remains aligned with the EU’s single market and customs union. The U.K. economy has benefited from decades of unfettered regional trade; its most important trading partners remain the other 27 members of the EU. 
If the U.K. opts to move further away, the cost could reveal itself in diminished trade activity, weaker economic growth and ultimately a lower standard of living. Some companies may decide to relocate their facilities to the EU, as several multinationals have warned, and others may choose not to expand into the U.K.
Investment implications
Over long periods of time, stock prices tend to move roughly in line with GDP growth. That doesn’t bode well for the long-term outlook for U.K. stocks in aggregate. However, we see a bifurcated market in the years ahead. Companies with large exposure to the domestic U.K. economy — such as banks, retailers and utilities — may have a more difficult road than multinational corporations that happen to be based in the U.K.
Some of the U.K.’s largest publicly-traded companies fall into this category, including oil giant BP, drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline and alcoholic beverages firm Diageo. To use Glaxo as an example, the company generated worldwide revenue of £30.2 billion in 2017, according to its most recent annual report. About £22 billion, or nearly 75%, of that revenue came from the United States and other non-European markets. The U.S. also was Glaxo’s biggest growth market, with sales rising 10% from the previous year while European sales were flat. Revenue attributed to the U.K. was just £940 million.
Brexit should have little to no impact on the long-term outlook for several large, multinationals based in the U.K. For certain other U.K. companies, however, Brexit could be quite meaningful in terms of revenue growth, future profitability and supply chain management. From an investment perspective, that means fundamental, bottom-up analysis of U.K. companies and their sources of revenue will be critical to identifying potentially attractive long-term opportunities.
Rising political uncertainty is a theme that investors probably will be living with for a decade or more. It is a generational issue, in our view, and a significant departure from the relatively stable politics of the post-Cold War era. If there ever was a time when investors could ignore politics and still prosper, that time has come to an end. The events of the past two years have made it clear: Political analysis and fundamental investment analysis are now two sides of the same coin.

277,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/tax-tips-2019-beyond.html,9 tax tips you need for 2019 and beyond,Taxes,"January 30, 2019","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Tax rules change — be vigilant and stay flexible. 
Diversify your tax strategies to hedge against tax-rule changes.
Think beyond deductions to long-term goals.
You know that diversification can protect your investment strategy from curveballs thrown by financial markets. But what about your tax strategy?
If there’s one thing to learn from the sweeping tax reforms of 2018, it’s that tax rules change. Despite what many taxpayers believe, tax rules are not “permanent.” The only way to protect yourself from the vagaries of taxation is to diversify your approach.
“Do not put all your eggs in one tax strategy basket,” says Capital Group wealth strategist Jeff Brooks. “We just don’t know what will end up becoming the law and how that law will be interpreted and enforced by the Internal Revenue Service.”
The value of a diversified tax strategy will become clear in April, when the realities of many tax changes that kicked in during 2018 hit home.
Changes made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 serve as valuable and practical lessons in the need for flexibility. “’Permanent tax laws’ means they are permanent until Congress changes them,” Brooks says.
Here are nine tips for building a diversified tax strategy that can help investors stay ahead of whatever comes out of Washington:
1. Manage standard deductions.
Tax strategies that work well in one year can falter when tax rules change. Flexible strategies allow investors to shift where it makes sense. The 2018 tax year presents several examples.
Perhaps the most significant change for many taxpayers in the 2018 tax year is the near doubling of the standard income tax deduction. The deduction jumps from $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples, and from $6,350 to $12,000 for single filers.
This major change means the vast majority of taxpayers will not itemize, Brooks says, which puts into question the usefulness of past strategies that relied on itemized deductions.
2. Consider bunching.
So what should itemizers do now? Brooks suggests crafting a tax plan that “bunches” into a single tax year expenses that previously were deducted annually. For example, taxpayers might take the standard deduction in one year, and then accumulate deductible expenses to itemize for next year.
“If I have deductions I spread over a number of years and would not be in a situation where I could itemize, why don’t I try to force them into one year?” Brooks says.
A donor-advised fund (DAF) is a good option for the charitably minded. A DAF is a centrally managed collection of individually directed charitable accounts. It allows individuals to irrevocably donate cash, stock or other assets like real estate and take a deduction in the year of the gift to the DAF that presumably would be greater than the standard deduction limit.
Donors don’t have to release all the funds to charity at once. “I can keep making gifts year after year from the donor-advised fund, but I get the deduction in the year of my gift to the fund,” Brooks says.
3. Keep an eye out for new opportunities.
It’s also important to refresh tax strategies to take advantage of new incentives. For instance, Qualified Opportunity Funds (QOFs), a tax incentive created in 2017, might appeal to high net worth investors.
QOFs — which can be used to invest in Qualified Opportunity Zones identified by states as needing economic development — can enable investors to postpone and possibly eliminate taxes resulting from the realization of gains on the sale of capital assets. As long as sale proceeds are invested in QOFs for this purpose, taxation of the capital gains is postponed. Over time, the tax basis in the sold property is adjusted, reducing or eliminating the tax generated by the sale, Brooks says.  
4. Update estate plans.
The estate tax planning process should never be “set it and forget it.” Changes to estate-planning laws are common and can be significant. Plans built on current rules can be rendered ineffective by subsequent legislative changes.  
Take 2018 as an example. The basics remain the same: Lifetime gifts carry cost basis to the recipient, and estate assets receive a “step up in basis” to date of death value at owner’s death. However, the gift and estate tax exemption amounts doubled in 2018 to $11.8 million per individual, or $22.36 for a married couple.
5. Believe in basis planning.
The result? Basis planning is the new paradigm. It’s now prudent for taxpayers to use the much higher exemption amount to keep appreciated assets in their estates, Brooks says. When they die, they can then bequeath appreciated assets to beneficiaries. That way, the basis is stepped up to value at the time of death.
“Now the argument is switched for many more taxpayers who are now saying, ‘No gifts. I want that property included in my estate,’” he says.
6. Pay medical and education costs directly.
For ultra-wealthy taxpayers, the $11.2 million lifetime exception may still be too low. One way to increase their tax-free gift ceiling is to help pay the education and medical expenses of loved ones, Brooks says. Most commonly used for children or grandchildren, these payments may be made for anyone and do not apply to the annual exclusion or lifetime exemption if payment is made directly to the provider. Gifts to newly created and tax-advantaged ABLE accounts are another way to fund lasting care for those with special needs.
7. Use the rules to your advantage.
All tax laws are subject to change, but some have withstood the test of time, Brooks says. Including longstanding statutory structures spelled out in the Internal Revenue Code can make a tax plan more durable.
“These are rules that have been on the books for years,” Brooks says. “If you build something around these, you might have more faith they’re going to remain available for years to come.”
Certain “split-interest trusts,” such as grantor-retained annuity trusts, charitable remainder trusts, charitable lead trusts and qualified personal residence trusts, are structures that have endured and may give investors more faith in their longevity. Consider them not only for their tax benefits but also the protection they may offer from changes to other tax provisions.
8. Negotiate based on tax changes.
Knowing a change is coming is essential when negotiating the terms of an agreement that will carry forward into future tax years. Again, 2018 serves up an important reminder of this. Prior to 2018, alimony was deductible by the payer and reported as income by the recipient. 
All that changed for 2019. Alimony payments for divorces finalized after December 31, 2018, are no longer deductible. In essence, alimony payments are now made with after-tax dollars.
The payment amount should reflect the new tax treatment of alimony or support payments. “When negotiating or renegotiating a divorce decree, be certain that it properly reflects the economic consequences of this change in the law,” Brooks says.
9. Diversification pays.
Diversification of tax strategies allows taxpayers to create plans that accommodate changes to the law. The most recent changes have enabled taxpayers to focus less on minimizing their tax bill and more on creating strategic goals to meet current cash flow needs and build a legacy.
“The changes imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act have allowed more people to refocus on the true purpose of charitable and non-charitable giving, rather than simply the creation of a tax deduction,” Brooks says. 
Above all, recent changes to the tax code are a reminder of the importance of seeking counsel. “We always encourage our clients to seek tax counsel,” Brooks says. “Good counsel will raise the fact that laws can and do change over time.”

278,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/market-corrections.html,Correction or bear? 6 charts that explain market declines,Market Volatility,"January 16, 2019","The market turmoil that began in early 2018 intensified later in the year, as the S&P 500 Composite Index declined nearly 20% between its September peak and late December. This slide put U.S. equities firmly in correction territory — typically defined as a 10% decline from a recent high — and has raised questions about whether this could be the start of a much bigger decline.
But how often do market corrections turn into entrenched bear markets? Not very often. In fact there have already been six market corrections since the current bull market started in 2009.
There are countless reasons for short-term market declines, but a prolonged bear market — a drop of at least 20% from a peak — usually results from severe economic imbalances that typically also lead to a recession. The current expansion’s slow recovery has delayed the onset of imbalances for years, but in recent months we have started to see some build, such as corporate debt. In the current environment, these issues don’t seem severe enough to cause a near-term recession, but they will require careful monitoring in the year ahead.
Below are five key points to keep in mind when thinking about market declines:
1. Market corrections are fairly common.
Market pullbacks are more common than some may think. Even a 5% decline over a short period can feel unsettling, but they occur on average three times per year. Market corrections of 10% or more are also surprisingly common and have happened on average once per year.
The volatility of early 2018 may have felt more jarring than usual because it followed a year that didn’t have a single 5% decline. But the market movements of 2018 are much more typical than those in 2017. In fact, since 1980 there have been only four years that had no such drawdown.
2. Markets typically have recovered quickly.
While markets may seem pessimistic during periods of heightened volatility, they often bounce back quickly. Despite averaging a double-digit correction per year, 31 of the last 41 calendar years have finished with positive returns. 
Equity returns are often strongest after a decline when investors believe that the market has overreacted to the downturn. The average 12-month return immediately following a 15% or greater decline is 55%. That’s why it often can pay to remain calm and stay the course.
3. Bear markets have been rare outside of a recession.
Over the last 50 years, only eight of 36 market corrections have been classified as bear markets. Most bear markets coincide with recessions, which are also relatively infrequent. In the absence of a recession, a growing economy can still spur positive corporate earnings growth, which supports equity prices. Market declines outside of a recession have tended to be shorter, and rebounded much quicker, than those during a recession.
Forecasting the start of the next recession is a difficult task, but it is fairly clear that the U.S. is in the later stages of an extended economic expansion. Recessions usually begin as a result of excesses in an overheating economy, and we are starting to see some early signs of this. Of note, corporate and government debt have been rising steadily. Shadow banking (unregulated financial transactions) is growing, and companies continue to take on debt to make dividend payments, implement share buybacks and fund M&A activity. The effects of tariffs on global trade and growth will also be worth monitoring in the year ahead.
At this time the imbalances don’t seem extreme enough to derail the economy in the near-term, but they do suggest weakness sometime in 2020, according to our economists. If monetary policy continues to ease, the ramifications of those imbalances could be pushed down the road.
4. Even bear markets have been relatively short-lived.
A long-term focus can help investors put bear markets into perspective. Since 1949 there have been nine periods of 20%-or-greater declines in the S&P 500. And while the average 33% decline of these cycles can be painful to endure, missing out on part of the average bull market’s 263% return could be even worse.
Bear markets have averaged 14 months, a relatively short time compared with the 71 months of the average bull market — another reason why trying to time investment decisions can be difficult and is usually ill-advised.
5. Volatility can compound investor mistakes.
Buy low and sell high — it’s one of the most commonly quoted investment phrases, but all too often it’s the exact opposite of how most investors actually behave. Looking at U.S. equity asset flows since the start of the 2008-09 bear market illustrates this.
In 2009, as markets bottomed to levels not seen in more than a decade, investors were net sellers. This continued even as markets rallied strongly over the next few years. It wasn’t until 2014 that investors became net buyers again after they’d missed out on some of the best returns in years. Asset flows reached record levels in 2017 and 2018 — more than eight years into a bull market when markets were reaching all-time highs and valuations were elevated.
Market declines can be painful to endure, but rather than trying to time the market, investors often are better served by periodically examining their holdings to ensure they are ready for elevated volatility. Investors should have a buffer of liquidity and sufficient diversification. During volatile periods, investors can benefit from:
Maintaining a broadly-diversified portfolio
Balancing between growth and dividend-oriented strategies within equities
Ensuring their fixed income allocation provides diversification from equities
Having a portion of their portfolio in liquid assets, such as cash and high-quality bonds

However, declines are a normal part of markets, and investors who stay the course over the long run typically have been rewarded. One silver lining may be that market declines are typically much shorter and less severe in the absence of an economic recession. On average, bear markets during an expansion recovered within six months – nearly three times quicker than when they coincided with a contraction.
U.S. recessions occur for a variety of reasons, but typically are the result of a macro or financial imbalance. At this time the imbalances don’t seem extreme enough to derail the economy, but suggest weakness sometime in 2020 as they continue to build.  If monetary policy continues to be accommodative, the ramifications of those imbalances could be pushed even further down the road. Volatility may remain elevated in 2019, but investors are often best served by remaining calm and maintaining a long-term perspective.

Several signals indicate investors are looking past the current strength in the U.S. to the potentially damaging impact of escalating U.S.-China tensions on the global economy. These include an inversion of the Treasury yield curve from two-year to five-year maturities. Futures markets are also reining in expectations of rate increases by the Federal Reserve in 2019, and even pricing a higher probability of a rate cut rather than further rate hikes in 2020.
That both the U.S. and China — the world’s two largest economies — are in the late stages of the economic cycle with limited resources to spur growth is further weighing on investor sentiment. On top of that, European growth has disappointed as the highly trade-dependent economy has suffered the most from global trade disruptions.
It is then no surprise that market sentiment has followed the direction of China-U.S. negotiations on trade and other economic matters — with the arrest of a senior executive at China’s telecom giant Huawei presenting an unexpected turn of events. As the U.S., China and Europe seek to rewrite the rules of world commerce in their favor, investors will need to brace for heightened market volatility in the year ahead.
To get clarity and perspective on these market dynamics and the factors driving them, we provide the following insights from three of Capital Group's investment professionals.
China-U.S. relations will continue to drive market sentiment.
As we monitor the ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and China on trade, tariffs, intellectual property protection and a host of other issues, we need to acknowledge that the relationship has fundamentally changed and evolved into one that is increasingly competitive and tense. Moreover, the two sides are still too far apart, and neither has suffered sufficient economic pain to make any real compromises.
The arrest in Canada of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei CFO and vice chair, and daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei on December 1 was the latest blow in an increasingly tense relationship between the countries. The arrest has significant ramifications given Huawei’s position as China’s leading hardware firm, biggest patent filer, 4G/5G equipment giant, leading chip designer, smartphone champion and most globalized company (with about 30% of revenues coming from overseas).
Clearly, some kind of talks leading to a ceasefire on further tariffs would lift market sentiment — and given the scale of what’s threatened, would have a substantive impact on the outlook for the U.S. and Chinese economies. On the other hand, a stalemate in negotiations after expectations were raised at the G-20 summit in Argentina will continue to disappoint market participants.
Moves in the making
As companies around the world look to the future, many are already making plans. Final-assembly electronics firms are establishing and expanding facilities outside of China at the demand of their U.S. clients. Thailand seems popular for electronics firms and Vietnam already dominates in apparel and textiles. U.S. tariffs have accelerated decision-making that was already under consideration by many companies due to rising costs in China. Firms are generally not shutting down their China facilities, at least for now, though attrition might mean their overall employment will fall.
On the domestic front, China is coping with a deceleration in economic growth. There are signs of weakness emerging in the labor market. While middle-class, white-collar income gains remain strong, unskilled wages are rising slowly. Consumer confidence is off its highs, but still good. Consumer credit growth is declining, however, leading to sluggish car sales and lower revenues in Macau, which tend to be early indicators of softening demand.
Business confidence has weakened and with the threat of additional tariffs, I do not see it returning anytime soon. So I think several of China’s economic measures will continue to deteriorate. China’s authorities will likely provide fresh fiscal and monetary stimulus as the slowdown becomes more painful, with the March–April 2019 period following the Chinese New Year likely to see a bigger pro-stimulus push.
Negotiations between the U.S. and China are likely to move in fits and starts. In addition to trade, sensitive technologies will continue to be areas of contention. Both countries are facing challenges in their economies and each side has many incentives to strike compromises. But both the U.S. and China also have distinct strategic, long-term objectives that are at odds with each other. Against this backdrop, investors should be prepared for a period of elevated market volatility.
Decoding the yield curve’s message
The U.S. Treasury yield curve from the two-year to the five-year maturity points has inverted, meaning that five-year bond yields dipped below two-year yields. It is the first time this has happened since 2007. Why did it happen and what does it mean?
Historically, an inverted yield curve has been a telltale sign that the bond market is pricing in a tough economic environment ahead. It's created when the Federal Reserve tightens monetary conditions via its more direct control of short-term interest rates. Long-term rates, largely controlled by market forces, drift lower when investors start to believe the Fed's tightening will lead to economic contraction, lower rates, lower inflation and eventually fresh rate cuts. A positive sloping yield curve, on the other hand, is a signal the bond market is looking for a mix of strong growth and inflation.
The primary driver of this yield curve inversion was a tightening in financial conditions and a Federal Reserve that has grown more dovish. In the months of October and November, a stronger dollar, wider credit spreads and weak equity markets all contributed to tighter financial conditions. The Federal Reserve looks at financial conditions as a real-time monitor for future economic conditions and has taken note of this inversion.
In recent speeches, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Fed Governor Lael Brainard appear to have taken note of market moves, shifting their rhetoric to be more dovish. Bond markets took note, bringing down expectations of rate increases in 2019 from over two hikes to less than one hike. Furthermore, markets have shifted rate expectations in 2020 and 2021 from a Fed that is more likely to raise rates to a Fed that is more likely to cut — a tacit acknowledgement that a slowdown is coming.
I think the market view is reasonable. The probability of cuts in 2020 and 2021 should indeed be higher than hikes. With the effects of fiscal stimulus wearing off in 2019, and growth in China and Europe softening, it might be difficult for the U.S. to continue to anchor the global economy. Recent business investment has not been robust, which further dampens future growth prospects.
A few things to keep in mind about an inverted yield curve:
Of the eight instances when the two-year to five-year portion of the curve has inverted going back to 1972, six of those instances saw a recession within two years, and all eight saw the Fed cut rates within two years.
Not everyone seems to pay attention to the same part of the curve: The two- to five-year part of the curve gets less attention. Bond investors and academics tend to pay more attention to the two- to 10-year part of the yield curve, which has not inverted yet, but which could happen if financial conditions remain tight.
When looking at two- to 10-year maturities, an inverted yield curve has preceded every recession since 1950. That said, there have been two times that the curve inverted and no recession followed.
The exact timing of the recession following an inverted yield curve has varied from nine months to over two years. It is a warning signal glowing orange, but not bright red.
Despite late cycle, a U.S. recession is not a foregone conclusion.
The U.S. continues to exhibit late-cycle characteristics. The labor market is tight with rising wages and cost pressures. The Fed has responded by raising interest rates in line with what they have signaled through the “dot plot” and reduced liquidity via reduction in its balance sheets. Quantitative tightening and a strong dollar trend are also causing global central bank liquidity to decline faster than expected and resulting in higher funding costs for U.S. borrowers.
In addition, non-U.S. growth is a bit softer than expected. Leading indicators of activity in China and Europe continue to slow while Chinese stimulus is not expected to provide an offset until late in 2019. Macro and financial imbalances continue to build. Corporate and government debt is on a steady rise. The fiscal stimulus has created deficits of an estimated 5.0% to 5.5% of GDP in 2018, a peak in the period since the financial crisis of 2008.
Recession coming in 2020?
As fiscal spending increases, deficits should widen. Shadow banking is growing, and companies continue to take on debt to make dividend payments, implement share buybacks and fund M&A activity. The economic cycle appears to be evolving on a path that suggests weakness sometime in 2020, although this may not translate into a full-blown recession. Moreover, stock markets peak on average six months prior to the economic cycle. But we don’t think a recession is starting in the near-term, so we could see a bounce back in equities at some point before then.
In my view, the probability of an entrenched equity bear market in the next six months remains low. The Fed has indicated it will be responsive to economic data, the widening in triple-B corporate bond spreads has been moderate, equities have modestly re-rated and there will be the lagging effect of fiscal stimulus. Corporate earnings growth will decelerate but should remain in the mid-single digits.
The major risk to this view will be the trajectory of U.S.-China trade negotiations, as a further escalation could create a negative feedback loop. This is a very fluid situation that we will monitor closely.
In periods of heightened market volatility, investors can benefit by:
Maintaining a broadly-diversified portfolio
Having a portion of their portfolio in liquid assets, such as cash and high-quality bonds
Making certain that a portion of their fixed income allocation provides diversification from equities
Holding a combination of growth and dividend-oriented strategies in their equity allocation

282,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/rates-rise-china-slides-market-volatility-commentary.html,Rates rise and China slides: Making sense of market volatility,Market Volatility,"December 4, 2018","Upended by rising Treasury bond yields, volatility has returned to global stock markets as investors grapple with concerns over tighter U.S. monetary policy, a brewing trade war and slowing economic growth in China. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, has moved higher and stocks have pulled back in October. The selloff has been led by declines in the shares of technology companies, including many of the names that consistently drove equity markets to new highs during a nearly decade-long bull market.
“The stock market pullback is not particularly surprising when you consider that rates are rising, the labor market is tight and the Federal Reserve is removing some liquidity from the system,” says Capital Group economist Darrell Spence. “Equity valuations were also elevated, and the market had been underestimating what the Federal Reserve said it was going to do in terms of increasing short-term rates. And there is a trade dispute with China that could put further pressure on the economy.”
Indeed, investors should expect more volatility ahead as we approach several potentially market-moving events, including the U.S. midterm elections, further Fed tightening and the withdrawal of crisis-era stimulus measures by the European Central Bank. We see several factors that could continue to spur market volatility. Here, we discuss five of them:
1. Rates are rising and the Fed is removing monetary accommodation.
U.S. equities may have been due for a pullback, but part of the answer lies with the bond market. The rapid rise in rates in recent weeks was the immediate trigger. It is not so much the direction that has surprised markets as much as the pace of the bond market reaction, with the 10-year bond yield touching a seven-year high of 3.23% intra-month before ending October at 3.15%, and the 30-year bond yield hitting a four-year high of 3.4% and ending the month at 3.39%.
That’s sparking market volatility amid rising rates and the end of quantitative easing. There will be continued tightening as long as the pace of economic activity remains elevated and inflation expectations are rising. “As the Fed moves from quantitative easing to tightening policy, it is more data dependent in its timing,” says Mike Gitlin, Capital Group’s head of fixed income.
Unemployment and inflation, the latter measured by the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, are the two most important factors the Fed considers when deciding whether to raise rates. What the data tells us today is that the U.S. job market is very strong: The unemployment rate hit a 49-year low of 3.7% in September. The employment cost index, a broad gauge that measures wages and salaries and is closely monitored by the Federal Reserve, increased 0.8% in the July-September period from the prior quarter. And U.S. inflation remains near the Fed’s target, with the core PCE up 2% in September from a year earlier. These figures indicate that the Fed is likely to continue hiking interest rates into the foreseeable future. Our fixed income team expects another rate increase in December to 2.5%, with an additional two to three more hikes likely in 2019.
2. The pullback in technology should not be a surprise.
Technology has risen to become about a quarter of the S&P 500 index, and if you throw in Netflix and Amazon, the weight is roughly 30%. These companies have had an outsized effect on market indexes – in both directions. Moreover, program trading has likely contributed to sharper moves in markets, leading to higher volatility.
Shares of technology stocks, and the FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google owner Alphabet) stocks in particular, pulled back in October. Amazon traded lower despite posting record earnings, as its 29% sales growth was below expectations, in part due to the slowdown in retail. Facebook also reported strong earnings, but was more cautious with future guidance. Netflix shares also tumbled in the month after nearly doubling in the first nine months of the year.
But it is worth keeping in mind that the technology sector gained 11% year-to-date and has soared nearly 600% since the end of the last bear market. Technology stocks typically trade at a premium to the overall market, due to their outsized growth potential. With that in mind, stocks such as Facebook, Microsoft, and Alphabet have price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios less than 23x, based on estimated earnings over the next 12 months by data aggregator FactSet. These are high, but not excessive. Even stocks with very high valuations, such as Amazon, appear more reasonably-valued when using a revenue-based metric. For example, on a price/sales ratio, Amazon has the lowest ratio of any FAANG stock (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google), and more in line with the overall market.
3. We may be seeing some early fallout from trade skirmishes.  
Earnings season is upon us and while there haven’t been many hard data points, there were a few disappointments: PPG Industries and Fastenal, two industrial companies, referenced slowing China demand. LVMH, a French luxury goods company, also noted a ramping up of border checks on returning travelers and a weaker Chinese consumer. While these are early data points, they may be pointing to a potential trend. Ford CEO James Hackett estimated a hit of about $1 billion to the automaker's profits from higher metal prices as a result of tariffs on China.
4. Earnings comparisons will become tougher.
Corporate earnings are on track to top 20% growth in the third quarter, but many companies lowered guidance for future quarters. A buoyant economy and the recent tax cuts have provided a one-time boost to earnings growth that will fade in 2019 as the stimulus wears off, according to economist Jared Franz. “By some estimates, tax cuts have boosted earnings-per-share growth by as much as 50% in 2018,” Franz says. “Therefore, earnings could decelerate in 2019, and the market is beginning to price that in.
“The dollar appreciation has also caught many by surprise,” Franz adds.  “That can be another potential headwind next year as companies in the S&P 500 Composite Index derive a significant portion of their sales from foreign markets.” 
5. Growth is slowing more than expected in China and Europe.
China’s economy in the second quarter grew at 6.7%, the slowest pace since 2016, leading to fresh stimulus measures from Chinese authorities. Europe’s economic growth rate has slowed for the third quarter in a row.
Despite a late economic cycle, some positive factors persist. China is injecting fresh monetary stimulus in the economy through an easing of credit conditions. The U.S. has seen steadily rising profit margins over the past few years, relatively low interest rates leading to low cost-of-borrowing, muted inflation in wages or commodities and reduced income taxes. These have created a positive tailwind which will diminish moving into 2019 but is unlikely to reverse. It does, however, point to more modest return expectations. 
“The market has been rising for nearly 10 years, so higher volatility at this stage should be expected,” says portfolio manager Alan Berro. “A 10% or 15% correction can happen any time for any reason. But do I expect a severe downturn, a deep recession or a global crisis coming? There is nothing I see out there today that leads me to that conclusion.”
For a full-fledged bear market to ensue, the economy needs to go into reverse. Our economists don’t expect that for some time. “We are late in this cycle but the economy is still growing strongly in the U.S.” says economist Darrell Spence. “Earnings could slow from peak levels but still remain strong by historic standards. The U.S. economy remains healthy and despite the tightening labor market, inflationary pressures appear to be relatively mild. And there are no obvious imbalances that might trigger a recession in the short term. So I expect the U.S. expansion to continue into next year.”
In volatile periods like this, investors should be sure to have a broadly diversified portfolio.
Investors should have a buffer of liquidity and sufficient diversification away from equities in their bond portfolios. Asset allocation is important and helping clients understand how to navigate this environment will be crucial. In these periods, investors can benefit from:
Maintaining a broadly-diversified portfolio.
Having a portion of their portfolio in liquid assets, such as cash and high-quality bonds.
Make sure at least a portion of their fixed income allocation provides diversification from equities.
Have a balance between growth and dividend-oriented strategies in their equity allocation.

283,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/global-consolidation-5-charts.html,The global consolidation wave in 5 charts,Trade,"November 21, 2018","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
A series of mergers since 2015 has left many industries dominated by a few global giants.
The semiconductor, health care services and media industries have seen the most consolidation.
Consolidation brings benefits of scale, but also can draw regulatory scrutiny.
As a wave of mergers and acquisitions has swept the business world in recent years, more industries have come to be dominated by just a few massive companies. In many sectors, competitors have joined forces to build scale and drive innovation amid mature growth.
But the long-run success of these mega-companies is likely to vary. Consolidation delivers economies of scale but can make it harder to react nimbly to new competition or shifts in technology. Merged companies also may find themselves in the crosshairs of regulators concerned about concentrated market power.
We take a closer look at the merger wave in five charts:
1. Global M&A activity has been high for four years.
Corporate consolidation has gained pace steadily since the global financial crisis, driven by a combination of cheap money and balance sheets boosted by a strong stock market. Although the sheer number of deals is not new, the size of the deals is historic and creating dominant companies.
This year is on track to be an unprecedented fourth consecutive year with more than $2 trillion in proposed M&A transactions. There have been more than two dozen deals valued at more than $10 billion each this year, most notably megadeals between Disney and 21st Century Fox, CVS and Aetna, and AT&T and Time Warner.
2. The consolidation wave has swept up many industries.
The surge in big mergers has left its mark across a range of industries, especially semiconductors, health care service providers and media. The heavy deal-making has created dominant players with tremendous influence over their industries and the broader economy.
“On the whole, consolidation makes companies more efficient and achieve better scale,” says equity portfolio manager Brad Freer.
As a result of the push for corporate mergers, many industries in the MSCI All Country World Index now are dominated by just a few big companies. Some of the highest concentrations are found in footwear, health care services and entertainment, where the top five companies stand head and shoulders above the rest with 90% or more of total industry revenue.
In the U.S. alone, a 2016 study found that more than 75% of industries have become increasingly concentrated as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman index, the metric used by government antitrust regulators.
3. The semiconductor sector exemplifies the dramatic consolidation.
The semiconductor industry is a prime example of consolidation over time. Like the ever-shrinking size of the transistors themselves, the number of top-tier players has shrunk dramatically since 2002.
Of course, the largest companies also make the smallest chips. The dominance of Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung Electronics has allowed these companies to invest in massive research and development programs essential to keeping up with technological advances. Consolidation also has mitigated the boom-and-bust cycles that hurt the industry in prior decades.
“Consolidation has been good for shareholders,” says analyst Shailesh Jaitly. “Semiconductor companies are more rational and can focus on their core competencies.”
With more stable revenue streams and strong balance sheets, these companies began paying dividends a few years ago. They now are eligible to be held not just in growth portfolios but also income-oriented equity strategies, providing them with a much wider, deeper investor base.
4. Consolidation is a two-way street: Some industries are fragmenting.
While industries such as semiconductors and media have been consolidating, big players in other sectors have been slimming down. For instance, industrial companies such as General Electric, Honeywell, Danaher and Illinois Tool Works have spun off businesses. Spin-offs often can be good for investors: The breakup of Tyco International into six separate companies from 2001 to 2014 achieved a higher return than the S&P 500 for the same period.
“When you become a smaller company focused on a smaller end market, you have more focus to drive the business and focus on results, and you have a currency in the business you’re running,” says portfolio manager Martin Jacobs.
5. As digital traffic soars, technology giants face a tougher regulatory environment.
The digital world of data and commerce also is coming to be dominated by a few giants that have grown in part through acquiring smaller rivals — from Google parent Alphabet and Amazon to Tencent and Facebook. Outside of China, Google virtually owns the global search engine market. Facebook users worldwide account for about one-fourth of the global population.
Along with these companies, digital trade itself continues to expand. Cross-border digital traffic has grown 40 times larger since 2007 and is projected to grow exponentially in the next five years.
However, that growth has attracted the attention of regulators. As seen with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect earlier this year, regulators increasingly are seeking greater purview over issues of intellectual property, data storage and privacy. Digital companies will need to learn to navigate regulation to continue to succeed, just as Nike and other consumer companies had to do when facing challenges to their labor practices in developing countries.
Well-run multinationals are best positioned.
Of the global giants created by this wave of consolidation, some will thrive and others will become too large for their own good. It’s the job of professional investors to identify the ones that will succeed and prove to be good investments over the long term.
In many cases, “well-managed multinationals are the best-positioned companies to navigate an uncertain environment,” says portfolio manager Jody Jonsson. “They have the experience to navigate multiple regulatory regimes and the staying power to ride out business and economic cycles.”

284,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/3-key-takeaways-midterm-elections.html,3 key takeaways from the U.S. midterm elections,Politics,"November 7, 2018","There is much to digest from Tuesday’s historic U.S. midterm elections. With Democrats gaining a majority in the House of Representatives for the first time since 2011, and Republicans widening their majority in the Senate, each side can legitimately claim a qualified victory. Indeed, that’s exactly the message we heard in dueling press conferences on Wednesday.
Once they are finished celebrating, however, the tough work of governing the nation under a divided Congress will begin. What might that political environment look like? Can they get anything done on the legislative front? What are the likely implications for financial markets?
Here are three key developments that, in my view, will characterize the U.S. political scene over the next two years:
1. Government gridlock
Bottom line: do not expect much substantive change to happen between now and the 2020 presidential election. Major new Republican initiatives – such as additional tax cuts or immigration reform – are highly unlikely to pass, to the extent they require House approval. The same applies to any big-ticket items on the Democratic wish list, such as rescinding last year’s tax cuts, rolling back regulatory reductions or any sort of Medicare-for-all proposal.
Early indications are that the stock market likes this gridlock scenario, as evidenced by the broad-based rally the day after the election. For companies, it means the status quo is likely to remain in place for the next two years. That’s a good thing for chief executives who now can advance their business plans accordingly. As we’ve seen in past years when the House has flipped, the market tends to take it in stride.
2. Limited areas of cooperation
While gridlock will be the overriding theme in Washington, it wouldn’t surprise me if some limited areas of cooperation emerge over the next two years. For Democrats and Republicans, it simply makes sense to get something done – not just so they can claim to be rising above partisanship, but so they have at least a few accomplishments to trumpet during the next election.
Predicting where this common ground may be found is challenging in such a hostile political environment. It’s entirely possible that no agreements will emerge. But some promising areas include increased infrastructure spending, new limits on drug pricing, a minimum wage hike and paid family leave. All are issues where Republicans and Democrats, at least at one time, had some overlapping interests.
In addition, one risk to the tax status quo involves a potential deal around the federal debt ceiling, which is expected to be addressed in the summer or fall of 2019. At his Wednesday press conference, President Trump signaled a willingness to make some “adjustments” on tax policy in negotiations with Democrats. We’ll have to wait and see what develops there, if anything.
3. It’s all about 2020
Needless to say, the U.S. presidential campaign began at midnight Tuesday. Everything must be seen in that context. Whatever happens over the next two years, every move will be calculated and measured based on how it could impact the presidential race. There probably will be new investigations launched by House Democrats. The White House and Senate Republicans may counter with their own.
On the legislative front, House Democrats probably will propose numerous measures that have no chance of passing the Senate. We may see proposals for new taxes on the wealthy, a rollback of corporate tax cuts, and perhaps even an attempt to expand the number of seats on the Supreme Court. Those measures will likely be dead on arrival, but may prove to be valuable talking points come 2020.
Market implications
There’s no telling how markets will react to these events going forward. The sharp selloff we saw in October is a reminder that heightened volatility can return at any time, even when the U.S. economy is humming along nicely. But it’s always worth taking a look at history as one considerable data point.
Since 1950, U.S. stocks have always generated positive returns in the year following a midterm election. That may or may not be the case in 2019. But for investors with a long-term perspective, it’s worth noting that markets have the dynamic capacity to ignore political noise and move to the beat of their own drummer. More often than not, that’s good old-fashioned company fundamentals.

285,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/european-markets-navigating-choppy-seas.html,European markets: Navigating choppy seas,Europe,"October 3, 2018","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
After a stellar 2017, European equities have disappointed investors so far this year.
Global trade disputes and slowing economic growth are pressuring markets.
We see more challenges and uncertainty on the horizon for 2019.
What happened to the enthusiasm for European equities in 2017? The election of reform-minded President Emmanuel Macron in France, the staying power of Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany and signs of improving economic growth in the eurozone supported double-digit gains in European stocks. European markets, as we penned in our 2018 Outlook, were finally in position to reverse a years-long period of trailing behind a powerful U.S. bull market. 
This year, those hopes have faded like the paint on a rusty old container ship. Amid investor worries over global trade skirmishes, the trade-oriented European economy has slowed appreciably. The political scene in several key countries has tumbled into turmoil. And European stock markets have reflected this unfortunate turn of events, failing to keep pace with U.S. stocks yet again. Here are three underlying issues contributing to the dislocation in international markets:
1. Global trade disputes hurt Europe more than any other major economic region.
“Europe is particularly vulnerable to trade disruptions,” explains Robert Lind, a Capital Group economist based in London. “The headlines tend to focus on conflicts between the U.S. and China, however, it is Europe that has the most to lose in a trade war. In my view, this is a critical reason for lackluster returns in European stocks this year.”
Through the end of the third quarter, the MSCI Europe Index is down about 2% for U.S.-dollar based investors. That compares with a return of roughly 11% for U.S. stocks, which have repeatedly hit new record highs during the 9-month period. In currency markets, the euro has slipped 3% against the dollar this year as higher U.S. interest rates, a strong U.S. economy and a flight-to-safety trend have supported U.S. asset flows.
2. Divisive politics are calling EU stability into question.
In addition to trade fears, politics got in the way. A European stock market rally that started with the May 2017 French elections slowly petered out as it became clear that Macron’s economic reforms would face stiff domestic opposition. In Germany, Merkel came under fire as her Christian Democratic party lost significant ground in the parliamentary elections, though she narrowly managed to hold the chancellorship.
Across the Channel, rancorous Brexit negotiations have imperiled the administration of U.K. Prime Minister Teresa May. It is possible that the U.K. may leave the European Union without a trade deal, which could be highly problematic for both parties, Lind notes.
At the same time, following recent elections in Italy, a new populist-coalition government has reignited fears about the fiscal policies of Europe’s third largest economy and its long-term desire to remain in the European Union and the 19-member eurozone.
“European politics is continuing to fragment,” says Talha Khan, a political economist at Capital Group. “Populist, nationalist, fringe-party movements are reasserting their influence across the continent. They are not going away. If anything, they are gaining ground in countries such as Germany, Italy and Norway, among others.”
Looking ahead, the calendar of events for 2019 does not inspire much optimism, according to Khan. “We could see a change of leadership in Germany, a ‘hard Brexit’ outcome in the U.K., political and financial turmoil in Italy,” Khan says, adding that European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is set to leave office in October 2019.
On top of that, the ECB is expected to wind down its bond-buying stimulus program by December and consider raising interest rates in mid- to late 2019. The ECB has held its key policy rate in negative territory since 2014 in an attempt to jumpstart the European economy.
“That’s a lot of uncertainty in a relatively short period of time,” Khan says. “It’s a recipe for more market volatility ahead.”
3. Secular growth companies favor the U.S. over Europe.
Another reason for the disparity in returns between U.S. and European stocks is Europe’s relative lack of high-growth, tech-oriented companies. The technology and consumer discretionary sectors, which have led the U.S. bull market since 2009, make up a much smaller percentage of the European market.
It’s no secret that extraordinary market leaders such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix are all based in the U.S. By comparison, just two companies – Germany’s SAP and the Netherlands’ ASML – account for nearly half the market capitalization of the European tech sector. Europe’s dearth of innovative tech and consumer-tech companies has left the region trailing in a long-term, tech-centric rally.
Investment implications
“This is why we invest in companies, not sectors or economies,” says Capital Group portfolio manager Brad Freer. “From a macro point of view, I’m not sure if the situation in Europe will improve any time soon, but it doesn’t have to improve for fundamental investors to find compelling, secular-growth companies.”
European aircraft manufacturer Airbus is the most obvious example, Freer says. Its shares trade at a significant discount to U.S.-based Boeing. According to Freer, other companies in this group include Irish low-cost airline Ryanair, chip equipment maker ASML and British bank HSBC, which is looking to Asia for faster growth opportunities.
“Based on index returns, European equities have been disappointing, no question about it,” Freer says. “But the fact remains, there are like-for-like companies in Europe that are far more attractive from a price perspective than their U.S. counterparts. Those opportunities are just very stock specific and they don’t hinge on any sort of tailwind from the European economy.”

286,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/global-trade-tariffs-6-charts.html,The state of global trade tariffs in 6 charts,Trade,"August 1, 2018","Global trade tensions are on the rise. And while much of the attention has centered on a series of retaliatory tariffs between the United States and China, trade disputes with European and North American allies also have strained traditionally friendly relationships.
Investors should avoid putting too much emphasis on the short-term noise of daily trade rhetoric, but the eventual outcome likely will have economic, investment and political implications across the globe. To provide guidance on a complicated and rapidly changing situation, Capital Group’s investment team selected six charts that highlight a key takeaway for the current state of global trade.
1. Concerns over a possible trade war with China have unsettled markets.
Markets were calm in 2017, but that changed early this year. With equity valuations near historic highs, external factors are having a greater influence in unsettling markets. And while regulatory scrutiny of tech companies and threats of higher inflation also have contributed to market jitters, the looming shadow of global trade has overshadowed most other issues.
The initial announcement of U.S. tariffs — on solar panels and washing machines in late January — preceded the country’s first market correction since 2016. Since then, equities often have moved in step with global trade headlines. Markets bounced around wildly when the first week of April saw a volley of escalating threats between the U.S. and China. As trade talk diminished, investors felt more comfortable returning to riskier assets. Markets drifted upward until late June, when the U.S. threatened $200 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods and sent markets downward once again.
The situation remains in flux. In just the last week, the U.S. went from suggesting automobile tariffs could be on the way to issuing a joint statement with the European Commission chief announcing an intention to work toward “zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies.”
2. So far, it’s more talk than action.
Much of the volatility has been a result of investors trying to interpret to what extent the threats would come to fruition. So far it has been a small portion, although the situation remains fluid. Recently the U.S. threatened tariffs on an additional $400 billion of Chinese exports — a figure that far exceeds China’s imports from the U.S. Capital Group political economist Matt Miller believes this imbalance raises the risk that Beijing will retaliate with nontariff measures, such as consumer boycotts or heightened enforcement of regulations on American businesses operating in China.
“Even as the battle heats up, one shouldn’t assume that President Trump’s unusual and aggressive negotiating style is a prelude to an all-out trade war, which would hurt both sides,” Miller said. “As each side feels the other out and tests the other’s mettle and ultimate goals, it seems likely that we’re in for an unsettling period of tit for tat that may rattle markets and companies caught in the crossfire.
3. Tipping point: U.S. trade imbalances have deteriorated for years.
The U.S. trade deficit has increased dramatically over the last 25 years, prompting the new administration to try to reverse the trend. Capital Group Vice Chairman and portfolio manager Rob Lovelace noted this approach has been a long time coming. 
“President Trump has talked about his issues with trade deficits for decades,” Lovelace said. “It features in many of his public comments throughout his business career.  He has stated the U.S. needs better balance in trade accounts with all other countries.  In line with this view, the administration wants a dramatically reduced trade deficit in physical goods.”
4. China is in the spotlight after reaching record trade deficit.
Although Trump would like to reduce the deficit with all countries, his biggest target has been China. The U.S. trade deficit with China was $376 billion in 2017, with exports at $130 billion and imports at $506 billion. In addition to tariffs, the administration has considered blocking Chinese firms from buying U.S. companies with industrially significant technology. But even then, it backtracked on some of the toughest restrictions initially proposed.
Hong Kong-based portfolio manager Steve Watson notes that although risks have increased, he remains optimistic about the future of Chinese stocks. “If I step back and consider the long-term outlook, I remain enthusiastic about China from an investment perspective,” Watson said. “I think China’s economy will continue to grow at a healthy pace, and we should be able to find attractive investment opportunities there for many years to come.”
5. Digital trade is skyrocketing — and tariffs shouldn’t stop that.
Most of the uncertainty has centered on the trade of physical goods. A possible silver lining is that an increasing share of transactions now involves digital assets and ideas rather than tangible products.  Cross-border digital traffic surged in the last decade and its growth is projected to accelerate over the next several years. Many aspects of the digital economy cannot be easily dictated by governments, so the impact of trade negotiations is likely to be less severe for technology companies than manufacturers.
“While I hope we don’t see a clampdown on the flow of physical goods around the world, I do take some comfort in the fact that the most important flows — data and capital — are likely to continue moving around the world relatively unimpeded,” Watson explained in a recent Capital Ideas podcast. “That kind of international trade is much more difficult to restrict.” 
6. Despite the uncertainty, investors should still think globally.
Over the past several years, the rise of globalization has supported corporate growth and investment returns. And that doesn’t need to change now. Despite the potential headwinds, many of our investment professionals still find global exposure — whether it is achieved through investing in multinationals or non-U.S. domiciled companies — a good long-term strategy.
“Of course, not all global companies will thrive in this environment,” said portfolio manager Jody Jonsson. “Fundamental research will be key to identifying potential winners. Having invested in global companies for nearly three decades, I have found that successful multinational companies typically have innovative management teams, diverse sources of revenue and resilient balance sheets. These are the attributes I will be looking for as globalization enters a new era.”
Rob Lovelace agrees. “Shifts in economic and trade regimes and turning points in markets provide managers like us the opportunity to capitalize on short-term distortions in asset prices and to invest in companies that we view to be winners in the long term,” he said.

For nearly a decade, the world’s major central banks have given new meaning to the term “accommodative” but they may have finally reached an inflection point. The Fed began raising rates in 2015 and began selling assets in 2017. The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan are reining in asset purchases, although neither has begun raising rates or reducing assets on their balance sheets. The assets of those three central banks still total about $15 trillion.
Accommodative policy has provided a significant tailwind to asset prices. Now, policy is tightening. This is uncharted territory for the global economy. How much of a headwind will assets face amid less supportive policy? That question is likely to influence markets for years as central banks begin to unwind the unprecedented monetary stimulus that has played a critical role in shaping the global markets since 2009.

Higher spending on technology, equipment and facilities could ease worries that S&P 500 companies have reached a peak in their profit growth. The spending could also give the U.S. economy a fresh set of legs, and help extend an expansion now in its ninth year.

Low unemployment, rising wages, strong equity markets and an overall solid economy have helped lift U.S. consumers’ expectations. And this may be good news for consumer spending. Since 2000, consumer expectations have tracked well with U.S. consumer spending growth, with about a six-month lead. Elevated consumer expectations since mid-2016 suggest that consumer spending growth could accelerate as the economy continues to grow, wages increase and consumers feel a tailwind from lower income tax rates. Growth funds, supported by in-depth fundamental research, may help investors take advantage of strengthening consumer spending by identifying companies that stand to benefit from higher consumer expectations and spending.

Economist Darrell Spence offers his views of the world’s major economies at midyear.
View transcript
Will McKenna: Darrell, we've had a nice tailwind here for some time, in terms of synchronized global growth. A lot of countries growing together in tandem. But also, a number of headwinds that investors are focused on. As you think about the rest of 2018 into 2019, give us your outlook on the global economy.
Darrell Spence: Yeah. I think, as we look out across the world, things still look fairly synchronized, but perhaps just slightly less synchronized than when we talked six months or so ago.
In the developed world, the U.S. is still leading the charge. The cycle is very strong. Consumers are benefiting from a very strong labor market, leading to accelerating wages. They're also benefiting from the tax cut that was implemented earlier this year. Exporters are seeing strong demand for exports, partly a function of the weaker dollar that we've seen over the past year or so. And businesses are starting to invest again, partly because of the strong demand but also because they, too, are benefiting from a big cut in the corporate tax rate that occurred earlier this year. However, it's pretty clear that the U.S. is moving into the late cycle, and that does have some implications. But we think for 2018, growth is likely to remain pretty healthy.
Shifting over to Europe, after a very strong second half of 2017, growth in Europe has started to slow — perhaps more than, I think, people expected it to. There's some debate about whether that's a function of the flu epidemic, coupled with some pretty severe winter weather, but I tend to think it's something a little bit more fundamental than that. Part of it is related to the strong euro, which is really hitting European exports. Also, political issues are starting to bubble up again. The most recent example is Italy, where a new coalition government has raised questions about fiscal sustainability and the future of the euro. So, while we still think 2018 will be a positive, albeit moderate, growth period for the euro zone, there is increasing risk that there's some political event that knocks the markets around, or maybe even the economies around.
And then finally, in China, I think things are actually shaping up better than perhaps the consensus thought they would this year. Consumers there are also benefiting from some very strong wage growth. And also, exporters are doing well, because the global economy is still growing. We think growth will slow slightly as we exit 2018 into 2019, because China — somewhat similarly to the U.S. — is much later in the cycle than a lot of other areas. So, the authorities are starting to put in some restrictive measures. They're clamping down a little bit on shadow banking, clamping down a little bit on local government debt issuance to fund infrastructure. All of this causes the economy to slow a bit as we exit this year into next. But this isn't 2015–2016, where there are some serious concerns about China having a hard landing. Rather, it's more just the normal ebb and flow of the Chinese economy.
So, on the surface, it doesn't look a lot different than the last time we chatted. But underneath the surface, there's a little bit of a change in the composition of growth.

293,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/long-view-volatility.html,Volatility: The long-term investor’s unlikely ally,Market Volatility,"April 25, 2018","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Market corrections are part of the investment environment.
The global economy is largely supportive of corporate earnings.
Volatility can represent an opportunity for long-term investors.
After a long, calm period of relatively strong returns, global equity markets gave way to a jarring bout of volatility earlier this year. Recently, the trade dispute between China and the United States has roiled markets. The turmoil has served as a reminder that markets can and will change, and that a measured, long-term approach to investing is paramount in today’s environment.
Investing through adversity
Overdue and not entirely unwelcome: That’s one way to look at the correction in the S&P 500 earlier this year. Although swift declines can be unsettling, they have long been part of the investment environment.
“We were overdue for some kind of correction,” portfolio manager Tim Armour says. “I am not overly concerned about this pullback. Markets do better over the long term when they experience corrections periodically; they can’t go up all the time.”
Armour acknowledges that swift and dramatic change can take a toll on investors. When markets falter, some may be inclined to reduce their exposure to equities. Yet the chart below shows that periods of turmoil and steep market declines have subsequently proven to be among the best times to invest.
The chart shows that since 1949 there have been nine periods of 20%-or-greater declines in the S&P 500. And while the average 33% decline of these cycles can be painful to endure, missing out on part of the average bull market’s 268% return could be even worse. The fact that bear markets have had a relatively short duration (14 months on average), also makes it unlikely that trying to time the market will prove rewarding in the long run.
“I think the most important thing is to keep a long-term orientation,” Armour says. “Trying to figure out what the market’s going to do today or even next week is an impossible task and one that I don’t think is helpful to creating long-term wealth.”
The global economy remains supportive of corporate earnings.
Armour says that generally solid economic data continues to provide a healthy backdrop for markets in much of the world. In the United States, corporate profit growth remains healthy, tax reform could boost gross domestic product (GDP) and consumer spending is relatively strong.
Abroad, China’s GDP accelerated for the first time in seven years in 2017, and the economies of other emerging markets continue to show strength. Japan’s economy is in its best shape in years, and Europe is on the rebound. Overall, the International Monetary Fund expects global GDP to hit 3.9% in 2018.
“I still feel good about the economic backdrop for corporate earnings, and I think there are plenty of opportunities to invest in companies that have the potential to reward investors,” Armour says.
Bonds play important roles in a portfolio.
Volatility also reinforces the value of diversification, and the role of bonds, says Mike Gitlin, head of fixed income. “Investors need to stay balanced in their equity and fixed income weightings in their portfolios, especially during times like this. It’s important that investors focus on the four primary roles of fixed income in a balanced portfolio: diversification from equities, income, inflation protection and capital preservation.”
When equities are volatile, bonds have typically provided balance to a portfolio. The chart below shows that in market declines of at least 15% during the past three decades, bonds have provided relatively significant positive returns. That’s one of the reasons to invest in bonds, even in a rising rate environment.
“Some core bond strategies may not provide the diversification from equities that investors expect, and that could be a problem,” Gitlin says. “That said, the current pullback may present a great opportunity for investors to upgrade their bond portfolios to what we refer to as true core: that means reallocating to bond funds that offer the potential for both solid income and diversification from equities.”
The hard part? Keeping calm
Armour says the most important thing to do during periods of volatility may be one of the hardest. “You have to contain your emotions. It’s not easy to do on the way up, and it’s not easy to do on the way down, but it is your enemy in terms of creating wealth over time. Sticking with the fundamentals, employing good asset allocation and maintaining a balanced portfolio with a long-term horizon is the best approach.”
During the past several years, Armour says, the world’s equity markets have demonstrated a very low level of volatility. The environment may now be changing. Volatility could be returning to more normal levels, which can actually represent an opportunity for long-term investors with a systematic investing plan. A plan of regular investing can take the emotion out of investing and reduce the temptation to time the market. Of course, regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against losses. Investors should consider their willingness to keep investing when share prices are declining.
Indeed, as the chart below shows, the S&P 500 has had intrayear declines every year for the last 20 years. But while the market has its declines, it also goes up. Overall, the market has gone up 16 out of 20 calendar years since 1997. As a result, a hypothetical initial investment of $10,000 in the stock market, as represented by the S&P 500, would have grown to an ending value of more than $40,000 as of December 31, 2017.
“None of us can predict what the market is going to do in the short term,” Armour says. “But what we can do is identify good companies that we think are growing and will be better and bigger companies 10 years from now. If we get that right, through all sorts of market cycles, we are going to do well for our investors.”

294,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/portfolio-manager-bullish-china-trade.html,New Perspective Fund manager bullish on China despite trade tiff,China,"April 18, 2018","Since 1973, New Perspective Fund® (NPF) has sought to take advantage of changing global trade patterns. Today, the winds of change are stirring as the U.S. seeks to dramatically alter its trading relationship with China through steel tariffs and other punitive measures. Just last week, U.S. trade officials vowed to increase the pressure by imposing additional tariffs and seeking to block China’s technology-related investments in the United States.
Steve Watson is an NPF portfolio manager with 12 years of experience on the fund and 30 years in the investment industry. For the past 18 years, Watson has lived and worked in Hong Kong, where he’s had an up-close view of the changes taking place in China. Watson sat down to discuss his view of increasingly tense U.S.-China trade relations, his outlook on Chinese and global equities, and his flexible approach to guiding NPF through periods of volatile markets and geopolitical turmoil.
Q: Do the recent headlines focusing on U.S.-China trade disputes affect your view on the outlook for China-based investment opportunities?
A: We need to watch the situation carefully because it is a serious dispute and it does have the potential to grow into something very ugly and very disruptive. But if I step back and consider the long-term outlook, I remain enthusiastic about China from an investment perspective. China’s economy is growing at an annual rate of roughly 6.5%. We may see that growth decline a bit, but it’s worth keeping in mind that China had been growing at a rate north of 10% a few years ago. We’ve seen it cool down to this level, which I think is appropriate as the economy matures. I think China’s economy will continue to grow at a healthy pace and we should be able to find attractive investment opportunities there for many years to come.
Q: How do you think China’s leaders will react to the latest round of tough talk from the United States?
A: The Chinese focus much more on action than on rhetoric. So far, they have responded with some tough talk and significant tariff proposals of their own, but they’ve also mixed in some conciliatory messages and what seems like a genuine desire to avoid a full-blown trade war. Let's hope the situation doesn’t get out of hand but, for now, it looks containable.
One thing worth remembering is that the really important trade flows today involve data and capital. That kind of international trade is much more difficult to restrict. While I hope we don’t see a clampdown on the flow of physical goods around the world, I do take some comfort in the fact that the most important flows — data and capital — are likely to continue moving around the world relatively unimpeded.
Q: Illegal subsidies and intellectual property misappropriation also have been cited by the U.S. as major areas of contention. What approach do you think China will take on those issues?
A: I suspect the Chinese have been surprised in recent years that we haven't pushed back harder on these issues. My guess is, they've been expecting it. I think it would be appropriate for China to pursue reforms in these areas, particularly as its economy matures and China develops its own intellectual property that it wants to protect. I would like to think that China will be open to becoming more like other developed nations in this regard. Let’s hope that pragmatism reigns.
Q: Chinese stocks posted impressive gains in 2017. What explains those strong results in your view?
A: 2017 was an interesting year. There was a “wall of worry” that had to be climbed, particularly by Western investors. The “coming collapse of China” was a phrase you heard repeated a lot. There was a strong feeling that China was going to experience a property market collapse, or a debt crisis, or some other kind of large dislocation. As those fears began to fade in 2016, the market was able to rebound and climb that wall of worry. I think we are now in a place where investors are able to take a more rational look at the Chinese economy and Chinese investments, without so much hysteria in the background.
Q: Emerging markets also did well last year. Do you think there is more room to run?
A: The recent strong showing from emerging markets comes on the heels of a long dry spell when it didn’t go quite as well. Now, in 2018, we find ourselves in a world characterized by synchronized global growth and a relatively weak U.S. dollar. Those two elements, historically speaking, have been good for emerging markets investing.
I think those conditions will continue for a while and so, yes, I am enthusiastic about emerging markets with the disclaimer that it’s more difficult today to think of emerging markets as a single category. It’s a very diverse asset class with unique characteristics in each country and each company. Just think about how different China is from Brazil. That’s why it’s so important to look at each potential investment on a fundamental, company-by-company basis.
Q: How would you describe your investment style?
A: I am a contrarian, value-oriented investor. I look for excesses of enthusiasm and I try to avoid those areas. I look for excesses of pessimism and I try to find value in those areas. So, essentially, I find myself avoiding happy places and seeking out unhappy places.
I’ll give you an example – a Brazilian mining company called Vale. I became interested in Vale about three years ago when Brazil was in political turmoil, the economy was in recession, and Vale itself was immersed in scandal. Meanwhile, the iron ore that Vale sells to the world had collapsed in price. So my natural response was, that sounds very interesting. And, after a lot of pain and uncertainty, the company was able to right the ship. (Vale is held in the NPF portfolio at a weighting of 1.1% of assets, as of March 31, 2018.)
Q: NPF focuses on multinational companies that can take advantage of changing global trade patterns. Given that approach, are you concerned about the rise of protectionism around the world?
A: There is risk associated with the trade in physical goods around the world, but not all of the multinational companies that we invest in are directly involved in shipping goods around the world. When you look at some of our major personal-care investments, for example, these are companies that have multiple subsidiaries around the world doing business as though they are local companies.
While a clampdown on the flow of physical goods could potentially be impactful for a shipping company, it would not necessarily impact some of the other strong, multinational companies that are held in the NPF portfolio. As I noted earlier, it might be less impactful for companies engaged in data or capital flows, which you will also find in the NPF portfolio — companies such as Alphabet, Microsoft and JPMorgan Chase.
Q: In your view, where does NPF fit in an overall, diversified portfolio of mutual funds?
A: NPF provides investors with exposure to growth-oriented, multinational companies that tend to do well in up markets while also demonstrating the resilience, flexibility and balance sheet strength needed to ride out down markets, oftentimes better than companies that operate in a single, domestic market. NPF can add global flexibility to the core of a portfolio. We’ve long advocated the approach of including some truly global exposure to portfolios, rather than strictly dividing them into regional slices.
NPF is contained in several of Capital Group’s model portfolios.  In one example, the American Funds Global Growth Model Portfolio allocates 20% of its assets to NPF, with the remainder spread out among five other funds. In a more conservative approach, NPF makes up 10% of the American Funds Moderate Growth and Income Model Portfolio.

295,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/equity-returns-rising-inflation.html,Moderately higher inflation shouldn’t unsettle markets,Inflation,"April 16, 2018","Earlier in the year, the threat of higher inflation stoked fears of rapidly rising interest rates, contributing to the first market correction since 2016. But inflation has been relatively low for years, so some acceleration should be welcome and March’s 2.4% rate is far from levels that typically drag on equities. Since 1946, years with inflation between 2% and 3% have averaged double digit returns. And the S&P 500 has even had above-average gains in the majority of years with 3% to 4% inflation. Of course, inflation is only one consideration and future returns may vary, but investors should take comfort that, on its own, a moderate increase is not typically negative for equities.

296,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/putting-market-volatility-in-perspective.html,Putting market volatility in perspective,Market Volatility,"April 10, 2018","After several years of relative calm and healthy returns, financial markets are on edge. In a volatile first quarter, developed-market stocks and bonds declined amid inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, turmoil in the technology sector and a growing trade dispute between the United States and China — the world’s two largest economies.
Given heightened interest in these market-moving events, Capital Group’s investment team offers the following perspective on the return of volatility and the long-term outlook for certain asset classes:
The return of market volatility is expected and healthy.
Capital Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tim Armour believes the recent declines should be framed in the context of a multi-year bull market where key indexes have soared to record highs. Valuations for U.S. stocks have been high and, in such a market, periodic drops of 10% or more are not only common throughout history, they are healthy. They help to remove the froth from a market that may be running too far ahead of itself, bringing asset prices back in line with underlying fundamentals.
“We were overdue for some kind of correction,” Armour explained. “As you know, we remain focused on the long term. We still feel good about the economic backdrop for corporate earnings, and we think there are plenty of opportunities. I am not overly concerned about this pullback. Markets do better over the long term when they experience corrections periodically; they can’t go up all the time.”
U.S. interest rates should stay range-bound despite uptick in inflation.
One of the most important market factors is the level of interest rates, or more precisely, investor expectations for the future level of interest rates. Signs of inflationary pressures — including higher-than-expected wage growth — have driven interest rates up in recent months. However, that too must be considered in the context of a historically low interest-rate environment that has persisted since the 2008–09 financial crisis.
Despite a shift toward tighter monetary policy at the U.S. Federal Reserve, interest rates are likely to remain “range bound,” noted Tom Hollenberg, a fixed income analyst at Capital. And longer term yields could even fall if the strength of the late-cycle U.S. economy begins to fade.
“I see the 10-year Treasury bond yield remaining around 3% in the near term,” Hollenberg said, “unless global growth and inflation appear to be accelerating at an even more rapid pace than currently anticipated. That is still quite low on a historical basis and should continue to support economic growth.”
Stocks pull back amid signs of rising rates and higher inflation.
Despite modestly higher rates and declining financial markets, the U.S. economy continues to enjoy solid growth, along with broadly recovering economies in Europe, Japan and China. This period of global synchronized growth, coupled with accelerating corporate earnings, should help to support equity prices going forward, according to Capital economist Jared Franz.
“There is less room for cushion with valuations higher than normal; however, looking at earnings, there are reasons to be constructive,” Franz noted. “Global consumers are spending, corporate balance sheets are relatively stable and the U.S. tax cuts passed late last year could support upwards of low double-digit earnings growth in 2018. Ultimately, better growth is positive for companies.”
U.S.-China trade dispute may rankle markets but shouldn’t derail global economy.
A looming threat to global economic growth is the deteriorating trade relationship between the United States and China. Billions of dollars in tariffs and other punitive measures are being thrown back and forth by the two global heavyweights, along with a lot of tough-sounding rhetoric, and the discord appears to have no end in sight. That said, a U.S.-China trade dispute is not likely to derail the global economic recovery, says Capital Group Vice Chairman and portfolio manager Rob Lovelace.
“For a trading system to survive and thrive over the long term, interdependence is critical,” Lovelace explained. “These trade negotiations and disputes are now an element in a strategic struggle that is likely to last until China changes its approach on some fronts, and until the U.S. and China agree on a new balance that both can live with.”
Technology sector remains attractive despite recent steep decline.
The return of volatility has hit the technology sector hardest. In March, tech stocks encountered a number of challenges, including government regulatory scrutiny over data-sharing polices at Facebook, escalating trade tensions with China, a more difficult M&A environment and renewed concerns over valuations.
Despite these issues, the long-term outlook for some of the largest and most well-known tech companies remains excellent, said Capital technology analyst Irfan Furniturewala. Those companies include the so-called FAANGs — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet’s Google — which have come under intense pressure in recent weeks. In the case of Facebook, a serious mistake involving user privacy has hurt the company in the short-term, but management will likely correct the situation and continue to drive shareholder value in the years ahead, Furniturewala said.
“These technology leaders absolutely dominate their respective industries,” Furniturewala explained. “They have earned their leading positions. The long-term runway looks very attractive, in my view.”
Bear markets look less fierce with a long-term perspective.
Although volatile markets can be difficult to stomach, a look back at history shows that bull markets outnumber bear markets — in both results and frequency — by a wide margin. This is one reason why it’s important for investors to maintain a long-term perspective, stay invested in a well-diversified portfolio and avoid making panic-induced decisions during market downturns.
Rather than indiscriminate selling, investors who are nervous about heightened volatility may want to consider flexible equity funds with a history of resilience during downturns. Investors should also re-examine their bond exposure for excess risk, as diversification from equities is one of the primary roles of fixed-income securities in a balanced portfolio.

297,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/china-trade-dispute-rankles-markets.html,U.S.-China trade dispute may rankle markets but shouldn’t derail global economy,Trade,"April 4, 2018","Increased trade tensions between the U.S. and China — the world’s two biggest economies — are rippling through global markets, affecting a wide range of stocks, commodities and currencies. The U.S. has launched a series of tariffs and quotas aimed at curbing Chinese imports, including steel and aluminum, and China has responded in kind, targeting a long list of U.S. products. Together, the actions amount to multi-billions of dollars in punitive trade measures.
At this stage, the potential ramifications of the tariffs and corresponding impact on supply chains remain uncertain. Volatility is likely to persist as this trade dispute evolves.
In this Q&A, Capital Group Vice Chairman and portfolio manager Rob Lovelace shares his thoughts on trade negotiations and their impact on multinational companies.
With tax legislation behind us, the U.S. administration is focused on trade. Negotiations on tariffs and a potential trade war have markets nervous. What is your view on what we might see unfold, both in the near term and the long term?
Trade will continue to be on the forefront of the international agenda. U.S. and China leaders each have strategic economic goals, many of which do not align. This mismatch will lead to some tough negotiations.
President Trump has talked about his issues with trade deficits for decades. It features in many of his public comments throughout his business career.  He has stated the U.S. needs better balance in trade accounts with all other countries.  In line with this view, the administration wants a dramatically reduced trade deficit in physical goods. It remains unclear if they will also focus on services and financial trade which is not included in the traditional trade-deficit numbers they usually talk about.  The current negotiations on tariffs with China should be viewed in that broader framework.  
How do you see China approaching this and the U.S. responding to it?
China recently presented its development agenda. Its leaders have set specific goals for 2025 in areas in which they want the country to excel. The list is long, but the more important areas from our vantage point as investors include semiconductors, robotics, industrial and agricultural machinery, aerospace equipment, high-speed rail, biomedicine and electric vehicles. China’s stated goal is to have world-class companies in these sectors, and the unstated goal is to have independence from foreign suppliers.  
In the internet space as well, U.S. companies such as Google have not been allowed to operate in China unless they limit access to certain content and cooperate with the government in other ways.  These limitations on foreign companies created the space that helped propel Chinese companies such as Tencent and Alibaba, which are now among the most valuable technology companies in the world based on market capitalization. It is becoming clear that in these critical areas, China wants strong local champions, which reduces interdependence. They want a self-sustaining, more closed system. And with President Xi Jinping’s ascendancy as a leader unencumbered by term limits, China can more easily follow through on that long-term strategic vision.
For a trading system to survive and thrive over the long term, interdependence is critical.  China wants inter-linkages in many of these areas, but not interdependence. It is different from how Japan and Germany evolved into economic giants in the post–World War II period, with economies designed for global interdependence and integration.  
China has a much more mercantilist approach. In return for providing access to its huge market, China has assumed it can impose a host of restrictions on U.S. investment and trade. While it perennially objected, the U.S., Europe and others lived with these practices because China’s market offered increasing opportunities as it progressively opened up. There were also expectations that as China progressively opened wider its economy, those restrictions would fade.
Given China’s actions and goals, the U.S. is trying a different, more aggressive approach.  It wants China to open its economy and integrate into the global system. It wants protection of intellectual property. If not, the U.S. has to be focused on how it builds systems that are more secure — physically and in terms of intellectual property. These trade negotiations and disputes are now an element in a strategic struggle that is likely to last until China changes its approach on some fronts and until the U.S. and China agree on a new balance that both can live with.  
As we enter this new phase of relations with China, how should investors think about the viability of revenues and earnings that multinationals derive from China?
There has always been some skepticism by multinationals operating in China about how much money they will ever be able to repatriate.  For example, many companies that rushed in to build independent power plants later found that the promised profits never materialized as regulations were changed.  Companies know they can grow their business in China and reinvest their profits, but once that is done, taking the money out is hard. That has not really changed.
The multinationals are also susceptible to having their products reverse-engineered, with domestic companies emerging as competitors using similar or adapted technology. As an example, Caterpillar, which has dominated the global market for many years, is now competing with Japanese and Chinese heavy equipment producers.
In most of our analysts’ models and forecasts for companies that operate in China, they build in an attrition of business in China to local competition in five, 10 or 15 years depending on the industry. The experiential or branded companies are more difficult to replicate — a Starbucks, for example, or some very high-end luxury goods or insurance companies. That’s why we prefer to invest in those types of businesses as a way to get exposure to China’s growth. Some of these companies have longer runways than those in manufacturing industries. Over time, we are likely to invest more and more in China’s domestic companies for the reasons I outline.
Talks on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are also underway.  What are your thoughts on that?
NAFTA is very different than the issues the U.S. is negotiating with China. The geopolitical framework is not the same. NAFTA is not just about trade but also affects immigration and the environment.  Those latter two issues were not well addressed by NAFTA and given the U.S.’s current focus on immigration, it will need to be part of the revised agreement.  In the end, the level of integration and interdependence of the three countries should compel them to agree on a new structure, updated for current needs and thinking.  Mexico and Canada remain our largest trading partners with our only shared geographic borders. It will be very noisy, but I think a deal gets worked out.
Might these trade disputes trip up the global economy, which has seen a period of strong synchronized growth?
There is definitely a lot of nervousness in the markets, but right now earnings growth still looks robust and global synchronized growth is mutually supportive. Do I think the current trade disruption will fundamentally derail the broader landscape? No, I don’t.
There is definitely room for mistakes because stocks are trading at higher valuations. That said, market multiples are high but not excessive on a historical basis. And there are some catalysts in place that can help support the market. The U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks in the developed world are raising rates at a modest pace, corporate earnings growth remains robust and cash flows are still coming through.
Emerging markets are beneficiaries of the return of global expansion, especially if that drives a rise in commodity prices.  In my view, it’s more likely that physical trade disruptions will impact specific parts of the global economy, such as agricultural products, but they may not have a large enough impact to derail broad economic growth.

300,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/tax-reform-6-key-takeaways.html,U.S. tax reform: 6 key takeaways,Trade,"February 7, 2018","As Congress hammered out a massive overhaul of the U.S. tax system, Capital Group’s team of economists and analysts dug deep into the details to identify the potential impact on the U.S. economy and financial markets.
There are several critical questions about the impact of this historic shift in U.S. tax policy, according to our economists and analysts. Here are their views on some of the major issues at hand.
1. What will the tax changes mean for the U.S. economy?
Jared Franz, U.S. economist:  The tax bill is likely to stimulate U.S. economic growth in 2018 and 2019 through higher consumer and business spending. For example, at the median family income of $59,000 a year, many American families would receive a tax reduction of roughly $1,000 a year. After nearly a decade of deleveraging, American consumers are likely to spend most of those dollars, rather than save them. In addition, the combination of higher corporate profits, incentives to spend on business equipment and a favorable global backdrop will likely pull forward economic activity. We expect to see the nation’s total gross domestic product (GDP) move higher by roughly 0.25%. That would put annualized U.S. economic growth in the range of 2.5% to 3% next year, particularly if the global economy continues to accelerate as it did in 2017. 
On the other hand, this tax cut is likely to increase U.S. budget deficits and long-term federal debt levels, which will remain a concern. The Federal Reserve may also raise interest rates faster than expected, if a stronger U.S. economy and rising consumer spending spark higher inflation. We still believe interest rates will remain low, compared to historical levels, but the pace of rate hikes by the Fed could gradually increase if the economy appears to be overheating or inflation moves above the Fed’s 2% target.
2. How will financial markets react to the legislation?
Elizabeth Mooney, global accounting analyst: With the corporate tax rate declining from 35% today to 21%, American companies are among the biggest winners in the federal tax reform movement. That is especially true for domestic-oriented companies, which should be able to directly convert lower taxes into higher profits. In our analysis, we looked at the potential for a corporate income tax in the range of 20%. We determined that tax rate would, on average, translate into a 10% earnings boost for S&P 500 companies. So it’s clearly good news for American companies and, therefore, could support higher U.S. equity market valuations. Companies should also benefit from more favorable tax treatment for capital expenditures and for the repatriation of foreign earnings.
3. Under the repatriation provision, how much corporate money will be moving back into the U.S.?
Dane Mott, global accounting analyst:  We estimate that U.S. companies operating overseas have amassed about $3.2 trillion of undistributed foreign earnings. However, not all of it will be coming back to the U.S. because, in some cases, it may not be advantageous for certain companies depending on how much foreign cash they have available. We looked at the tax implications for hundreds of companies and, in our view, about $1.5 trillion is the maximum repatriation opportunity.
4. How will companies use their repatriated cash?
Mott:  This is a good question that we intend to explore with individual companies. A large amount of these assets are held by acquisitive technology and healthcare companies. Different companies clearly will make different decisions, but we can use history as a guide. Under a similar repatriation effort in 2004, many companies used the cash for share repurchases and dividend payments. We expect similar behavior now. Other uses may include acquisitions, pension contributions, debt reduction and business expansion.
5. Which sectors are among the biggest winners and losers?
Mooney:  There aren’t very many losers among American companies, just varying degrees of winners. Ultimately, the biggest winners will be companies that deftly convert their lower tax bills into higher profits. Companies in the telecommunication services, media and retail sectors are likely to be big winners. Since they are primarily domestic-oriented companies, they will be able to take full advantage of the favorable capex provisions of the tax bill, and they should be less affected by the reduced ability to deduct interest expenses.
6. What does tax reform mean for individuals?
Matt Miller, political economist:  Most Americans will see a non-trivial tax cut starting in 2018. Generally speaking, families with incomes in the range of $50,000 to $60,000 a year will receive anywhere from $800 to $1,200 in tax relief next year. In some cases, it may be as high as $2,000, depending on individual circumstances. In my view, this boost in take-home pay will be seen as meaningful by many American families. Meanwhile, high-income people living in high-tax states will generally see tax increases, largely because of the planned elimination of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The SALT provision expires at the end of 2025, leaving it for a future Congress to decide whether to resume the deduction.

Tax reform presents important changes for investors, while also preserving several areas some thought could change.
529s get more useful, while 401(k) plans and capital gains remain mostly unchanged.
Business owners might consider changing their form of business to take advantage of tax breaks for pass-through entities. 
Congress’ sweeping overhaul of the tax code presents a range of planning opportunities for investors. For individual taxpayers, the headline provisions include a lowering of the top tax rate to 37% from 39.6%. There could also be secondary benefits to investors resulting from lower corporate taxes. A deeper look at the new tax law, though, reveals equally important changes beyond tax rates, especially for business owners. Individuals are also potentially affected, especially when it comes to their retirement accounts, philanthropy and education savings accounts.
What changed?
1. Big breaks for business owners who qualify for pass-through income.  
Perhaps the most significant tax change for individuals is the modification in the treatment of income from pass-through entities.  Many businesses are pass-through entities, so the effect could be large and swift.
Pass-through income is generated via business income from business structures like partnerships, S corporations and sole proprietorships.
The new tax rates have a large effect on pass-through income, since this form of income was previously taxed to the end taxpayer, not at the corporate level. In 2017, this popular type of business income potentially faced the maximum tax rate of 39.6%.
That changes in 2018. If you’re eligible for the pass-through deduction, 20% of taxable income gets taken off the table for tax calculation purposes. That means if you’re in the new highest 37% tax rate for 2018, this rule lowers your effective tax rate to 29.6%.
Who this affects: Many business owners who receive pass-through income including professionals like doctors and lawyers as well as some financial advisors. There is complexity, though, that might curtail this option for some, so it’s important to consult your tax professional.
What to consider: Business owners might consider converting from a C corporation structure to S corporation or partnership to take advantage of the pass-through preference. Retirement plan contributions, however, may dilute the benefit of the pass-through deduction.
2. Limits rise even more for estate and gift taxes.
Federal estate taxes affect a small subset of high net worth investors now, but that number is likely to dwindle even further. That’s because new tax rules double the federal estate tax exclusion to $11 million for individuals and $22 million for couples. Very few estates are this large, making this type of planning even more of a specialty for advisors.
Who this affects: A very small percentage of the population with an estate value at death of $11 million.
What to consider: Estate planning strategies can be recalibrated for a much higher upward limit.
3. Expansion of 529 education savings accounts make them even more useful. 
Since their creation in 2001, 529s could only be used for post-secondary education expenses. But now, for the first time, these accounts can be used for eligible K-12, undergraduate and graduate schools (up to $10,000 per year per student for K-12 tuition). This is a big expansion of the appeal and utility of 529 plans.
Previously, investors looking for tax preference on education costs prior to college had to use other account types such as Coverdell Education Accounts. Coverdell accounts will remain available, despite speculation they would be curtailed. Those accounts have disadvantages to 529s, though, including much lower contribution limits.
Who this affects: Clients looking for ways to gain tax efficiency when paying for private school prior to college. 529s plans are growing in popularity, but there are many investors who have yet to take advantage of their numerous benefits.
What to consider: The 529 account is now potentially even more compelling than it was before. Contribution limits remain the same, allowing for annual contributions in 2018 of $15,000 for single taxpayers and $30,000 for those married filing jointly. Some taxpayers might consider making five years of contributions ahead of time, amounting to $75,000 for individuals or $150,000 for couples.
4. The cap on state income tax deductions and doubling of standardized deductions changes the math.
Many of the tax changes are positives for investors, at least in the early years, but not all. Over time, some taxpayers could end up in higher brackets due to a change in the way the annual increases to the brackets are calculated.
The math gets more complicated in other ways. For instance, taxpayers’ state and local income tax deduction is capped at $10,000, which is a negative for taxpayers in states with higher state taxes. But, the standard deduction is also doubled to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples.
The end result? Fewer people will itemize. It’s possible just 3% of taxpayers will itemize in 2018, down dramatically from the roughly 30% who do now. 
Who this affects: The increase in the standard deduction could have ramifications on charitable giving, which is an itemized deduction. Investors who take the standard deduction in 2018 may not get any tax benefit from charitable giving. The tax bill also eliminates all miscellaneous itemized deductions. One of those deductions is for investment expenses. Fees to financial advisors will no longer be deductible.
What to consider: As with many provisions for individuals, the limit on state and local tax deductibility expires in 2025. Meanwhile, the complex alternative minimum tax remains, but has been restructured in a way that is likely to affect far fewer people.
What didn't change?
While much attention is paid to the changes to the tax code, perhaps equally as important to investors are aspects that remain the same.
1. Tax rates on dividends and capital gains remain unchanged.
Tax rates on dividends and long-term capital gains stay where they are in 2018. For capital gains and qualified dividends, that means a maximum tax rate of 15% for taxpayers in the lower tax brackets. For those in the highest tax bracket, the tax rate is 23.8%, including the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax, associated with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
Who this affects: Investors with taxable portfolios that generate dividends or where investment sales are being considered.
What to consider: Investors and advisors can continue to strategically position investments in accounts to take advantage of preferential tax treatment given to qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.
2. Tax benefits to retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s and IRAs, stand.                                     
Good news for investors in 401(k) retirement plans: The tax benefits of tax-deferred retirement accounts stand, despite worries they would be curtailed. Changes were small and affect only a subset of taxpayers and investors.
Who this affects: Retirement accounts remain attractive options for taxpayers looking to save and invest for their retirement.
What to consider: There are some minor changes that investors should be aware of. For instance, investors who converted funds from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA can no longer undo or recharacterize the conversion once it’s done. Investors may want to check with their tax professionals to see if any other changes affect them.
3. Tax-lot selling rules stay the same.
Investors are still able to determine the most appropriate tax lot to use for cost-basis purposes on investment sales. This preserves an important planning tool for investors. In some versions of the tax bill, it was proposed investors would need to use first-in first-out (FIFO) accounting, where investors would use the cost basis of the shares they bought first. That could have meant higher capital gains for many investors.
Who this affects: Tax-aware investors who have bought investments over time, have unrealized gains and are considering selling.
What to consider: Investors and advisors are still able to analyze investments bought over time and consider which lots are most appropriate to sell for tax purposes. Investors can choose the specific lots to use for cost basis, or, in many cases with mutual fund shares, opt for the average cost of the shares bought over time.
4. Municipal bonds’ appeal is unchanged.
The reduction of the top tax rate could reduce the appeal of municipal bonds for some taxpayers. But at the same time, munis get more interesting due to the loss of itemized deductions. The bottom line: Munis remain important options for tax-aware investors.
Who this affects: Investors who look to municipal bonds as a source of tax-exempt income.
What to consider: Demand for municipal bonds from banks and insurers may ease a little. But individuals seeking income may still find municipals to be a potential source of tax-advantaged income and diversification. For higher tax bracket investors in states like New York and California, the relative attractiveness of local bonds could actually improve.

Our U.S. economist weighs in,United States,"January 3, 2018","Darrell Spence is a U.S. economist with 24 years of investment industry experience. In this interview, Darrell discusses his thoughts on the U.S. economy, how long this bull market can last and the latest on tax reform as we head into 2018.
What is your outlook for the U.S. economy?
The U.S. economy has been in an expansion for a while now and is probably the furthest along in terms of global economic recoveries, but I think it still has a ways to go. Growth is likely to remain above potential and the unemployment rate is likely to continue to drop. In fact, some of the resource utilization measures that we look at suggest core inflation could hit, if not exceed, the Fed's unofficial 2% target by the end of 2018. So that is something that we're watching pretty closely. And I think the Federal Reserve will continue to tighten gradually. I think two to three rate increases in 2018 is probably a reasonable assumption unless, again, growth or inflation really do something different than expected.
The duration of the U.S. recovery is longer than the average expansion. How much longer can it last?
On average in the post-war period, expansions have lasted 60 months, and we're now over 100. So it has definitely been longer than your average expansion, but if we're going to talk about averages, let me give you a different way to think about it. On average, the economy has expanded to 123% of its prior peak before rolling over into a recession, and right now we're at 115% of the prior peak. So from that perspective, we are below the average of prior expansions. Essentially growth has been slower in this expansion than it has been in the past. But the reason that's important is because we think recessions are caused by excesses and imbalances that build up in the system that ultimately need to be corrected, and slower growth means they take longer to materialize. There doesn’t appear to be anything systemic, or any big imbalances that we think are of a significant size and nature that would push the U.S. economy into a recession, within the next 12 to 18 months.
What do you expect the economic impact to be of tax reform?
It’s hard to put $1.5 trillion into the economy and not have an impact, and we’ll likely see that in 2018 and 2019. We estimate it would add about 25 basis points to GDP growth in 2018 and slightly less than that in 2019, but could be higher depending on how individuals spend that money. As far as which parts of the economy are impacted, consumers will obviously benefit as a lower tax bill can be meaningful, especially for lower income households. What may be underappreciated by the market is the impact of capital expenditures. Favorable treatment for capex could pull forward some planned projects into 2018 and 2019. Finally, it seems logical that any uptick in growth and inflation could cause the Federal Reserve to accelerate the pace of rate hikes in the next couple years.
What is your view on current U.S. equity valuation levels?
P/E ratios are higher than they have been historically, but you need to look at them in the context of where interest rates are, which is why the interest rate outlook is so important for the equity market outlook. If we do think rates, particularly at the long end, are likely to remain lower for longer, then I think these types of multiples are sustainable. The market has done very well over the past 12 months, but valuations haven’t really changed much because the rally has largely been based on better earnings growth.
What should investors expect in the event of a market pullback?
Not all bear markets are created equal. Some are short. Some are long. Some are not very severe. Some are obviously very severe. But what we have found is that the ones that are the most severe and last the longest tend to be, not surprisingly, associated with recessions. But the economy has been strong and we don’t really see excesses or imbalances developing. So if there was some market weakness over the next 12 months or so, I would suggest it would be more of a buying opportunity than a risk of a big bear market that would normally be associated with a recession.

304,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/fed-rates-inflation.html,Fed hikes likely to continue in 2018 as inflation firms,Interest Rates,"December 13, 2017","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
The Fed hiked rates in December, after a brief pause.
I see inflation and wages likely to strengthen next year.
That helps pave the way for further rate increases in 2018.
The Federal Reserve has raised rates in its December monetary policy meeting for the fifth time since 2015, increasing the federal funds rate to between 1.25% and 1.5%. This move was widely anticipated by the market, as the Fed has been communicating a lean in this direction for the last several months.
As we look to 2018, I think the Fed will continue to hike rates gradually, at the pace of roughly once each quarter, if the economy continues to run smoothly, inflation remains near its 2% target and equity markets don’t have a major downturn. Markets are currently pricing in two hikes for 2018. That seems like a reasonable expectation, looking at the bigger picture, as markets put a little under 50% probability that a negative event such as an equity market sell-off or an economic slowdown could slow down the Fed’s pace.
While this is our baseline Fed forecast, there is still a lot we will be watching. There are currently three vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, including the vice chair seat. In addition, Bill Dudley will retire as president of the New York Fed next year, and his replacement has yet to be announced. While incoming Chair Jerome Powell represents a likely continuation of the status quo, all of the turnover does present the potential for some uncertainty. We will be closely watching for appointment announcements and appointee speeches to get a sense of how Fed policy might shift.
Assuming that new Fed members don’t instigate any major changes of direction, my outlook is informed by two key metrics that correspond to the Fed’s dual mandate: employment and inflation.
The labor market continues to tighten.
Broadly speaking, the Fed has been comfortable with the unemployment rate for some time. At 4.1% in November, it was at the lowest level in 17 years. Strong job growth has continued, suggesting that over the next few years, barring unexpected shocks or a downturn, the national unemployment rate is likely to head south of 4%, possibly hitting the lowest levels since the 1960s.
The missing link, however, is wages. Private sector wage growth in the third quarter was 2.6%. While this is an improvement over what was seen in preceding years, that growth rate remains well below what one would expect to see with unemployment rates this low. This could be due to a few factors, such as the Great Financial Crisis leading to an unusually severe skills mismatch among job openings and job seekers, or the need to consider a measure of labor market slack that takes factors like discouraged workers into account. As a result, even lower unemployment rates may be needed to see wage growth reach or exceed 3%.
That said, our forecast is for wages to pick up because we think that at this level of unemployment, the relationship between wages and employment slack should get stronger.
Inflation not likely to hold back hikes in 2018.
Wages are a significant factor in inflation, and their tepid growth helps to explain why, despite the U.S. economy’s solid trajectory, inflation has recently run below the Fed’s target. Year to date, inflation measured by the core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which excludes often volatile food and energy prices, is running at 1.6%. That’s on the low side but not too far from the Fed’s target.
However, modest wage growth wasn’t the only factor holding back inflation in 2017. There was a five-month stretch from March to July when annualized core inflation was running at only 0.6%. A handful of seemingly temporary factors explain this pocket of weakness.
Wireless telephone service: The biggest culprit was wireless telephone service. Major cell phone companies offered unlimited data plans without changing the overall cost. This resulted in a quality adjustment that took the imputed inflation lower. However, my view is that while wireless pricing changes may remain low or even slightly negative, it will be nowhere close to the large negative numbers seen earlier this year (-7.0% in March and -1.7% in April).
Apparel: Apparel inflation was also unusually low. During that five-month weak patch, apparel printed at a -4.0% annualized rate. This compares to 0.0% apparel inflation in all of 2016. Apparel should firm because the dollar strength seen from 2014 to 2016 actually reversed in 2017. This should be a positive for both apparel and home furnishings prices. The late 2014/early 2015 dollar strength resulted in very weak apparel prices, and I expect the relationship to hold on the reversal.
Other temporary factors: Other pockets of weakness included used cars and trucks, airfares and lodging away from home. Prices of these groups have already stabilized or reversed. With the economy growing at a moderate pace, I believe that should continue to be the case. 
TIPS outlook
When we look at inflation so far in 2017, excluding the weak patch, core inflation printed at a 2.5% rate.  This rate is roughly in line with my expectations for a 2.3% to 2.7% core inflation rate in 2018. After backing out our assumptions for food and energy prices, we estimate that the market is pricing core inflation to be about a 1.8% next year.
This makes me bullish on the Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) asset class for 2018 as I think higher realized inflation than the market expects will result in an increased demand for TIPS. I also believe TIPS provide a good risk/reward asymmetry.
With the unemployment rate at 4.1%, we believe core inflation is likely to stay firm or rise from here as capacity in the labor market continues to diminish. On the flip side, city-level data shows that it is quite possible for inflation to accelerate to 3% or even higher if the labor market remains strong. These factors, paired with the potential tax cut stimulus coming from Washington, should keep the Fed on its rate-hiking path – unless an unforeseen shock throws it off course.
While I expect the Fed to continue raising rates in 2018, I do not expect long-term rates to rise meaningfully. I expect the 10-year Treasury, which is often the benchmark rate for mortgage loans, to remain range bound between 2.25% and 3%. Given tight valuations for credit, corporate bonds remain vulnerable to a widening of spreads to Treasuries. Against this backdrop, investors who take a broadly diversified approach in their fixed income allocation and avoid excessive credit risk shouldn’t feel a dramatic impact from Fed policy.

In September, the Federal Reserve announced that it would begin reducing the size of its balance sheet by letting some of its bonds mature without fully reinvesting the principal. This widely expected move marked another monumental step in normalizing U.S. monetary policy. There are likely to be several impacts from the Fed’s decision over the short and longer term. However, it is important to note that the Fed’s planned balance sheet “runoff” will take a long time. About half of Fed assets are in securities that will take more than a decade to mature. Given this slow pace of “run off,” barring any macroeconomic shocks, the balance sheet’s size is unlikely to fall to pre-recession levels. While the impact on rates may be modest, a well-managed bond fund should be able to help investors navigate a new era of monetary policy.

As part of our Wisdom of Experience investor survey series, we discovered that although women think of themselves as meaningful contributors to their household incomes and assets, the rest of the world doesn’t always view them in the same way.
Most of the women surveyed are highly engaged in investment decisions, contribute meaningfully to household income and are savvy about their portfolios. They believe as a group, women have more economic power as investors than in the workplace. Despite this, eight out of 10 women say they have personally experienced negative stereotypes about their investing acumen and financial contributions to their household.
The findings underscore the increasingly dominant role women play in the economy: In the U.S. alone, women control more than $11.2 trillion in investable assets, and the number of women with six-figure incomes is rising at more than three times the rate of men.

307,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/japan-economic-outlook-rising-gdp.html,Japan’s economic outlook: Land of the rising GDP?,Japan,"October 4, 2017","After decades of flat to negative economic growth, persistent deflationary pressures and stagnant wage growth, Japan’s economy has experienced a sustained recovery of late. As the global economic outlook has improved this year, so has Japan’s export-oriented economy, which is dominated by prolific auto makers and innovative technology companies.
In my view, Japan’s long-struggling economy may be nearing the light at the end of the tunnel, but there is by no means any guarantee that it will emerge on the other side any time soon. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth has continued to improve this year, rising 2.5% in the second quarter, roughly on par with the United States. Export activity is on the upswing, business capital expenditures are climbing, and the labor market is historically tight.
A nation without inflation
However, one crucial element is missing: inflation. With so many other economic indicators in positive territory, one would expect to see higher inflation at some point. And, the fact is, that’s just not happening in the world’s third largest economy.
Consumer price increases generally have remained well below 1%, despite massive monetary stimulus measures from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and many years of ultra-low interest rates. A big injection of BoJ stimulus in 2013 boosted inflation for a time, but it has since drifted lower, unable to sustain itself without aggressive central bank intervention.
The BoJ is currently buying ¥60 to 80 trillion per year of Japanese government bonds in an attempt to stimulate lending and jumpstart the economy. Japan is essentially the “grandfather of quantitative easing,” an experimental stimulus policy since adopted by many other central banks around the world, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.
But while the Fed and the ECB are now enacting or at least discussing the need for tighter monetary policy, a lack of inflation has left the BoJ in a divergent position, largely out of sync with the rest of the world. The BoJ’s core inflation target is 2%; however, it hasn’t touched that level in years, and the most recent reading came in at 0.2%.
Drumbeat of positive economic data
This stubbornly low inflation rate is especially perplexing given the long list of positive economic developments in recent months:
Japan’s economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.5% in the second quarter, the fastest rate of growth in more than two years. It was the sixth consecutive quarter of positive growth, the strongest run we’ve seen since 2001.
Export activity increased by 18.1% in August, the ninth consecutive month of growth and well above consensus estimates. Exports to North America grew by nearly 23%, clearly benefiting from an improving U.S. economy.
Japan’s unemployment rate stood at a two-decade low of 2.8% in August, and the nation’s job availability index remained at a four-decade high, reflecting one of the tightest labor markets in the world
Japanese stocks have gained 14% on a year-to-date basis through September 29, as measured by the MSCI Japan Index. They’re outpacing the rallying U.S. stock market, which has gained 13% so far this year, as measured by the S&P 500 Index. The yen, meanwhile, is up 3.5% against the dollar.
By these measures, the pace of economic activity has picked up nicely in Japan — but that’s partly due to an improving global economy. Quite a few challenges remain. Inflation is likely to move somewhat higher in the near term; however, a lack of significant wage growth could hold back more substantial and lasting gains.
The reality is that Japan’s economic revival effort is taking more time than most observers and policymakers expected. The window of opportunity to enact important fiscal, economic and labor market reforms — while times are relatively good — will close at some point, either when the global economy slows down or if there is a change in political leadership.
Last week, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe dissolved the lower house of Japan’s parliament and called a general election for October 22. Riding high in the opinion polls, Abe may be able to bolster political support for his economic reform measures, assuming the snap election goes his way.
Investors will surely be keeping a close eye on the outcome.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is implementing reforms to ease the cost of doing business, modernizing India’s infrastructure and opening the country to more foreign direct investment. The government is also backing technological innovations in the banking system. Mobile banking transactions, fueled by the proliferation of mobile phones and growing internet usage rates, are skyrocketing. India’s private banks, including HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra, could be among the beneficiaries of a growing economy and mobile banking. Furthermore, India’s young population and move to a more digital culture is attracting leading American and Chinese technology companies, such as Amazon and Alibaba, that are expanding into the country or taking equity stakes in Indian startups.

But recently, business- and industrial-focused areas have provided momentum to overall growth. Manufacturing activity and corporate profits, both of which came under pressure in 2015 and 2016, have rebounded. Combined with strengthening capital expenditures and retail sales, these conditions point to accelerating growth in the second half. But with valuations stretched in many areas, look for industry leaders with a proven record of generating top-line growth. For example, Microsoft has achieved solid growth from its Azure cloud computing business and Amazon remains a leading provider of cloud services to businesses.

Urbanization is transforming developing countries.
From now to 2025, the world’s cities will add 65 million people a year.
Developing countries will require massive infrastructure investments.
Urbanization is nothing new. It’s been going on for centuries, and it helped make Europe and the United States global economic and political powers. But what is different about today’s wave of urbanization is its unprecedented speed and scale — it’s bigger and faster than ever.
In fact, at the current pace of urbanization, the world’s cities will add 65 million inhabitants a year between now and 2025, according to researchers at the McKinsey Global Institute. The resulting demand for infrastructure will mean that each year, India alone will need to add as much floor space as exists in all of Chicago — and China more than twice that. Around the world, McKinsey estimates $57 trillion needs to be spent by 2030 on infrastructure just to keep pace with economic growth.
History has shown that migration to cities lifts the incomes of individuals, the wealth of nations and the global economy. By 2025, urban consumers are likely to inject about $20 trillion a year in additional spending into the world economy.
“We are quite simply witnessing the biggest economic transformation the world has ever seen as the populations of cities in emerging markets expand and enjoy rising incomes — producing a game-changing new wave of consumers with considerable spending power,” according to McKinsey’s report, Urban World: Cities and the Rise of the Consuming Class.
Many countries need infrastructure that simply meets basic human needs, such as safe drinking water. Others may want to modernize their transportation networks, and some may be trying to lay the groundwork for future global competitiveness by building a national broadband network. Roads and power account for about half of projected spending.
Indeed, building and repairing roads and power grids are the two areas with the greatest need for new investment, followed by water provision and telecom networks. Much of the money needs to be spent in developing countries. In many African countries, for example, massive investments are required to improve the transportation system, bring electricity to rural areas and provide access to water sources that are protected from external contamination. The infrastructure needs in Africa are especially daunting.
There are, of course, many countries with multibillion-dollar projects underway. Perhaps the most ambitious are in China, where such megaprojects include the world’s largest bridge and the longest underwater tunnel. The bill for such projects can be high. But without the necessary infrastructure, economies struggle to meet their full economic and human potential.
“What I think we will see — and this is one of the positive structural outlooks for China — is that probably 10-15 million people, at least, every year will be moving into cities. So that’s a pretty meaningful demand-construction outlook,” says Andrew Dougherty, a research director at Capital Group.

314,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/10-charts-us-economy.html,10 charts that explain what you need to know about the U.S. economy,United States,"May 17, 2017","The U.S. economy has been through a lot in the last decade. Since the financial crisis, economic growth has been slow but consistent, while stocks have surged. But the big question on everyone’s mind is, “Is this sustainable?” We think so. Here’s why.
The current expansion is one of the longest in U.S. history – but is it reaching its end?
The U.S. expansion is now entering its eighth year, which is long by historical standards, and has led some investors to ask whether it is on its last legs. While the expansion is indeed longer than most, there is precedent for it to continue, including a 10-year run starting in 1991. Elsewhere in the world, some countries have even enjoyed multi-decade expansions.
Expansions don’t simply die of old age, but rather from excesses or imbalances in an economy, which is not the case with the United States’ gradual but steady economic expansion.
Since the last recession, gross domestic product has averaged 2.1% annual growth, far lower than the 4.4% it averaged over the previous 10 recoveries. While growth has been sluggish at times, it has allowed the expansion to persist longer than average and potentially gives it more room to run.
So where is the economy now?
An important factor in the economy’s slow expansion has been weaker industrial activity, which has acted as a drag even as consumer spending has been strong.
Sluggish global growth has been a headwind for industrials, but manufacturing has shown improvement in recent months throughout the world. Higher infrastructure spending under the new administration could potentially boost growth even further.
A strong labor market has bolstered consumer spending. The unemployment rate has steadily improved since the financial crisis and is currently below 5%, often characterized as full employment.
Wage growth was stagnant for much of the recovery, but has accelerated over the past year. Higher wage growth is helping boost inflation expectations, which is now near the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.
What does this mean for my investments?
While economic growth has been slow, there has been nothing sluggish about U.S. equity returns. The S&P 500 is up over 280% since the financial crisis, easily outpacing its global peers.
The market has rewarded those who stayed invested in the face of significant global uncertainty. Events such as the European debt crisis, plunging oil prices, a slowdown in China and the Brexit decision threatened to derail the bull run, but U.S. stocks continued to be resilient.
While all areas of the market have been rising, cyclical stocks have outpaced defensive stocks in recent months following the U.S. presidential election. Expectations of a tax cut and increased infrastructure spending have boosted investor sentiment.
Financial stocks have done exceptionally well during this time on the prospects of higher interest rates and a rollback of some regulations.
The powerful bull market of the last eight years has lifted valuations above historical averages. Nevertheless, there are still bargains to be found in companies, but the current environment requires extensive research and selective investments.
The good news for companies is that they are making money again. Early in 2016, negative earnings growth sparked recession talk, but corporate profits have improved amid a rebound in energy prices and more optimistic views of the global economy. Earnings grew 13.5% in the first quarter of 2017, the fastest pace since 2011, according to data aggregator FactSet. Continued higher earnings growth would help stocks grow into their current lofty valuations.
What else should U.S. investors watch for this year?
The Federal Reserve will have investors’ attention throughout the year. After raising interest rates in December, they signaled three more hikes in 2017. The Fed already increased rates at its March meeting, and higher inflation and economic growth would support additional hikes.
But despite higher policy rates, don’t expect yields to rise rapidly. Low sovereign bond yields and accommodative central banks elsewhere in the world could anchor U.S. rates.
Investors should also keep an eye on currency markets. The U.S. dollar has risen dramatically since 2011, but signs are pointing toward a plateau or even a modest decline this year.
A weakening dollar would provide a tailwind to domestic exporters, and also benefit international investment returns for U.S.-based investors.
Finally, the new presidential administration’s ability to fulfill campaign promises will be critical. Higher infrastructure spending, tax reform, and financial deregulation would boost growth if they come to fruition, but could partially be offset by uncertainty over trade barriers and new immigration restrictions.

Macron’s victory on Sunday removes political-uncertainty cloud from European equities.
Risk assets should move meaningfully higher in the months ahead.
Le Pen’s defeat is a setback for populist, anti-EU political parties.
As political uncertainty fades, are european equities poised to break out?
French voters did far more than elect a new president on Sunday. They may have single-handedly restored European Union stability and set the euro zone on a decidedly more stable course, based on the reaction from investors.
Centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron’s victory over anti-EU candidate Marine Le Pen lifts a political cloud that had been hanging over the future of Europe, particularly since last summer’s Brexit vote placed the U.K. on a treacherous path out of the 28-nation European Union. With France now solidly anchored to the EU and the euro-area common currency, many investors are optimistic about the outlook for European markets for the first time in a long time. On a year-to-date basis, European stocks are up 15% in U.S. dollar terms and 10% in local currency, as of May 5.
Tailwinds gathering
“My view is, this election is a pivot point – a true catalyst – that will position Europe, certainly in the near term, as a more attractive place to invest,” says Andrew Suzman, an equity portfolio manager with Capital Group. “To be clear, challenges remain in Europe, and this election will not solve all problems, but valuations are in many cases very low, and a major political and economic disruption has been avoided.”
The French election result is adding to an impressive list of tailwinds gathering in support of European markets. They include signs of improving economic growth, attractive equity valuations compared to other developed markets, and a gradually depreciating U.S. dollar. The dollar’s sharp rise since 2014 has hurt European-asset returns for dollar-based investors.
Heading into Sunday’s election, markets were already anticipating a favorable outcome. French equities rose 3% in April, compared to a 1.5% gain for the MSCI World Index. In the first four months of the year, the MSCI Europe Index rose nearly 8% in local-currency terms and more than 11% in dollar terms. On Sunday, Macron won the second round of France’s two-round presidential election, gaining 66% of the vote to Le Pen’s 34%.
The euro rose to a five-month high against the dollar in late April as Macron soared far ahead of Le Pen in the polls. As the leader of the far-right National Front party, Le Pen had pledged to take France out of the EU, revive the franc as the national currency, and impose strict limitations on immigration. Macron, meanwhile, is a centrist, pro-EU advocate who has pledged to bring economic and political reforms to France while working cooperatively with Brussels and Berlin.
“Europe will welcome President Macron, and Germany is positively disposed to work with him,” says Talha Khan, a political economist in Capital Group’s London office. “Macron’s election will help reset the Franco-German relationship, which is at the heart of the EU. In a sense, Europe is Macron’s biggest opportunity. If he can convince Germany to do more to solve the economic imbalances in lieu of France’s commitment to reform, it will be very positive for the long-term outlook on the European economy.”
Return to fundamentals
Capital Group economist Robert Lind agrees, adding that a more stable political environment will allow investors to put aside the EU break-up risk and focus on more traditional considerations.
“Fading political uncertainty has finally enabled investors to concentrate on what’s important: the underlying fundamentals,” Lind says. “Companies in the euro zone are seeing a significant improvement in earnings growth, which reflects a stronger macroeconomic environment. After a protracted period of underperformance, there is scope for further relative gains in euro-zone stocks.”
Still, many of France’s largest publicly traded companies long ago learned not to rely on the sluggish French economy to act as a tailwind. Companies such as Airbus, L’Oréal, LVMH, Sanofi and Total are global enterprises that look to the U.S. and Asia, in addition to western and eastern Europe, for earnings growth opportunities, Lind notes.
European revival
Bond investors should also feel the impact of Macron’s victory as the yield spread narrows between French and German government bonds. French yields had widened significantly in the weeks ahead of the French election, reflecting fears that France might abandon the euro. Post-election, some investors now expect the European Central Bank to begin reducing its economic stimulus program later this year, or early next, and perhaps consider raising interest rates in 2018.
“The next 10 years will potentially be known in the history books as something like the ‘European revival period,’” says Thomas Høgh, a fixed income portfolio manager at Capital Group. “Under what I consider reasonable assumptions, the EU should remain together and develop further towards a federalist system of government. The appeal of populist parties should diminish as unemployment rates come down and the fruits of economic reforms begin to show up.”
In the meantime, there is reason to believe that the multiyear underperformance of European equities versus U.S. stocks could be nearing an inflection point, notes Marc Nabi, an investment specialist at Capital Group. Many U.S. companies are trading at a premium to European companies in the same industry. There are several factors driving this trend, but the valuation and return differentials should eventually normalize, as experienced in prior investment cycles, Nabi explains. A depreciating U.S. dollar will also help, he notes.
Valuation and currency trends indicate the time may be sooner rather than later to consider investing outside of the United States. Here is a look at six American Funds that have significant investments in non-U.S. domiciled companies:

317,markets_economy,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/global-trade-patterns.html,"As global trade patterns shift, should investors worry?",Trade,"May 2, 2017","What will global trade and commerce look like in the coming years, and how will it influence the investment landscape? It’s a question that’s been top of mind for investors lately, as a new administration in the U.S. seeks to renegotiate relationships with key economic partners.
The rhetoric of trade negotiations often seems abrasive, and what we see unfold in the political arena over the next few months or years may not be that different.
While negotiations of this type are unpredictable, the outcomes need not be extremely positive or negative for one side or the other. In fact, in many ways, it’s the advancement in technologies and how they reshape industries that will determine the future of global business as much as political negotiations.
Digital trade knows few boundaries.
The contours of international commerce have already undergone a profound transformation over the past two decades.
“If the 20th century was defined by a phenomenal rise in the transfer of goods and industrial commodities, the 21st century is being characterized by the rapid digitization of services and the increasing automation of manufacturing,” says Rob Lovelace, Capital Group portfolio manager.
Cross-border digital traffic surged in the last decade, and it’s only projected to increase more over the next seven years. Because many aspects of this digital economy cannot be easily dictated by trade agreements, the impact of trade negotiations is likely to be less severe for technology companies than, say, manufacturers.
Global supply chains are creating irreplaceable companies.
Supply chains today are deeply entrenched across the globe and will not be easily uprooted. As they’ve become global, companies have gained specialization and scalability that is difficult – if not impossible – to replicate.
Take Apple as the most obvious example. Motivated by a need to scale and manage supply chain risk rather than cost, Apple is a master of using a large supply chain to its advantage. It sources suppliers that can turn out parts in the most cost-effective way while still adhering to the company’s quality requirements.
In some industries, companies are willing to absorb higher costs because the long-term benefits of certain locations outweigh the near-term burden. Mexico, for example, has established itself as a premier auto and auto parts manufacturing center. About 90 of the world’s top 100 auto parts makers have production operations in the country, and General Motors, Ford and Caterpillar have reaffirmed plans to move production there. The facilities are concentrated in just five Mexican states, reducing transportation costs.
China has extraordinary influence on trade and companies’ growth prospects.
Over the past decade, China has become the largest growth market in the world for industries ranging from robotics and autos to airplanes and smartphones. In 2015, it accounted for 27% of global sales of robotics, 30% of elevators, 32% of autos and 16% of Boeing’s airplanes.
The country’s rise as an economic power will continue to have a profound impact on global trade. China’s relationship with the U.S. is multidimensional, deep and interdependent. The U.S. trade deficit with China was $347 billion in 2016, with exports at $116 billion and imports at $463 billion. A large chunk of the imports are from U.S. manufacturers that have set up assembly lines and factories in China.
Financial connections also run deep. China holds about $1.25 trillion in outstanding U.S. government debt, or a little shy of 10% of the total. In addition, Chinese companies raise capital in the U.S. financial markets through initial public offerings and offshore dollar bonds.
China’s stature leads to more trade for emerging markets.
Thanks to China’s influence, emerging markets have increased trade both among themselves and with developed economies. In 2015, 30% of developed-market exports went to emerging markets, and 46% of the trade by emerging markets was among themselves, according to the latest figures from the International Monetary Fund. Emerging markets’ share of global GDP has risen significantly.
As the global economy gains momentum, emerging markets should benefit. Already, we have seen a recovery in profit growth. Earnings for emerging markets companies are estimated to increase 17% in 2017, led by information technology and industrials, according to FactSet.
A rise in automation means labor costs matter less.
The low cost of Chinese labor has given the country an advantage for 30 years. But the situation is changing, as wages rise and younger workers become less willing to do repetitive tasks.
Automation is likely to further diminish the importance of labor costs. For instance, of the more than 250,000 industrial robots sold in 2015, a quarter of them were sold to China, according to the International Federation of Robotics.
The economics of automation have hit a sweet spot, where costs of robotics systems are declining and their capabilities are improving. With fewer cost advantages remaining in China, production may move closer to end-markets. It is this transformation in the economics of labor that could bring manufacturing and jobs to the U.S.
Expect new investment opportunities to emerge.
Global commerce has been transformed over the past two decades, and we’re likely to see global trade patterns evolve with the increasing digitization of commerce and the likelihood of new trade, tariff and tax structures in many parts of the world.
“Shifts in economic and trade regimes and turning points in markets provide managers like us the opportunity to capitalize on short-term distortions in asset prices and to invest in companies that we view to be winners in the long term,” Lovelace says.

The Fed raised rates by 25 basis points at Wednesday’s meeting.
Easy financial conditions could spur two more hikes in 2017.
We think rates could rise more slowly if conditions tighten.
When the Federal Reserve met this Wednesday, its committee members voted to raise the federal funds rate 25 basis points to a range of 0.75%–1.00%. The market anticipated this move, with futures pricing having indicated more than an 80% probability of a hike as of late last week. We see three central reasons why the Fed opted to raise rates.
Why the Fed hiked rates
1. Financial conditions have eased since late last year. Financial conditions are financial variables, including asset prices, that can influence economic behavior and thereby the future state of the economy. The broad dollar index is roughly unchanged, 10-year Treasury yields are slightly lower, credit spreads are tighter and the S&P 500 Index is up nearly 5% since the Fed raised rates in December.
2. The economy has continued to make progress toward the Fed’s mandated goals of full employment and price stability. The labor market continues to be strong, with the economy adding an average of 180,000 jobs per month over the past six months. This has kept the unemployment rate steady below 5%, which is already equivalent to the Fed’s long-run forecast for the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU.
On price stability, inflation is gradually rising toward the Fed’s 2% target. The January reading of the annual change in the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose to 1.74%, ahead of the Fed’s end-of-2017 forecast of 1.7% provided by its December projections.
3. In recent weeks, several Fed officials had strongly hinted at raising rates at the March meeting. That includes core members such as Chair Janet Yellen and New York Fed President William Dudley. In prepared remarks given last Friday, Chair Yellen said, “At our meeting later this month, the committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.”
In a recent interview, Dudley advised, “The case for monetary policy tightening has become a lot more compelling,” adding that a rate rise could come “in the relatively near future.” By hiking rates at this meeting, Fed officials gave themselves more flexibility to adjust policy for the remainder of this year and reduced the likelihood of “falling behind the curve” down the road, a concern that several officials have mentioned in the past.
Aggressive rate hikes face headwinds
The Fed may soon be joined in monetary tightening by the European Central Bank. President Mario Draghi, at a press conference last week, emphasized the euro zone’s “firming and broadening expansion.” This put upward pressure on rates globally as markets begin to look ahead to positive policy rates and an eventual end to European quantitative easing.
Looking ahead, additional Fed rate hikes will depend on the evolution of financial conditions and continued progress toward the Fed’s goals. On the one hand, if financial conditions remain easy and the economy evolves in a manner that exceeds the Fed’s expectations, then there may be two additional hikes this year.
However, we think it is more likely that financial conditions will tighten once the market anticipates a faster pace of rate increases, which will then allow the Fed to hike more slowly. To illustrate this point, financial conditions tightened significantly after the Fed raised the fed funds rate in December 2015 and surprised the market by forecasting four hikes for 2016. In the end, the Fed was only able to hike once in 2016 as tighter financial conditions led the Fed to be more cautious about further removing monetary accommodation.
How did we get here?
2008: To cope with the global financial crisis and ensuing deep recession, the Fed took a number of aggressive monetary policy measures, including cutting short-term interest rates to near zero and implementing three rounds of quantitative easing in the years that followed.
October 2014: The Fed ended its quantitative easing program.
December 2015: The Fed raised rates for the first time since 2006, by 25 basis points.
December 2016: The Fed raised rates by another 25 basis points. It also projected three hikes for 2017 at that time.

The Indian economy is rebounding after cash shortages hurt businesses and consumers.
India’s fiscal budget takes bold steps to discourage cash use and reform political funding.
The budget reiterates government’s commitment to fiscal prudence.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to enjoy widespread support from all cross sections of Indian society as key state elections get underway.
The digitization of payments is rapidly accelerating, providing an opportunity for banks.
Can India maintain its status as the world’s fastest-growing economy after a massive currency recall in late 2016 left consumers and businesses strapped for cash? From my home base in Mumbai, I’ve traveled the country over the past couple months to gauge the sentiment of businesspeople, assessing the impact of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetization campaign aimed at tackling corruption.
Here is what I learned, along with my thoughts on the government’s just-released fiscal budget and key state elections.
India’s economy is bouncing back
I traveled to a handful of states in north and south India, visiting people who run a wide swath of businesses in industries from automobiles to electrical components to textiles to food. There is no doubt all these companies felt the impact of the temporary cash shortage. Most told me their sales fell 20% in November and December. Some seasonal businesses saw production cuts, but overall there have been no large-scale layoffs. Most parts of the economy are normalizing fairly quickly as currency shortages abate.
While we will never know how much India’s economy would have grown had demonetization not happened, I don’t believe the effects of demonetization will be as severe as most suspect when official macroeconomic data is released in late February.
The worst is behind us, and in the next three to six months Indian business should hit its stride again, barring any further surprise disruptions. In my view, what is being missed in news stories of dislocation and disruption is the ability of people to adapt to change.
It was clear to me in conversations with company managers that demonetization is altering the way that business is being conducted in India. The informal economy and businesses that thrived on tax evasion have been hurt badly. If this change in behavior is sustainable, the country’s formal economy will grow rapidly, resulting in a broader tax base and stronger economic growth rate.
This would help micro- to medium-sized businesses, who could tap into formal credit sources and lower their costs. This is a big opportunity for Indian banks, and already we are seeing huge spikes in mobile banking accounts. In Tirupur, a textile-producing town I visited in the southern part of the country, approximately half a million new bank accounts have been opened since November.
Fiscal budget takes more bold steps to fight the black economy
The government’s fiscal budget unveiled on Feb. 1 took further steps to tackle corruption in India’s economy, increase the country’s tax base and promote financial digitization.
The budget clearly showed that the Modi government’s resolve to fight black money and corruption runs deep despite the difficulties that ensued during demonetization. I believe this bolsters his credentials as a bold reformer who wants to change the way business is done in India.
One proposed measure is a ban on all cash transactions above 300,000 rupees (approximately US$4,500); such transactions will incur a 100% tax penalty.
Another series of proposals takes aim at political funding. This includes reducing the maximum cash donation that a political party can receive from any one source to 2,000 rupees (US$30) — a 90% reduction from the previous limit. The budget also cuts the income tax rate for small- to- medium-sized firms to 25% from 30%. The move is expected to benefit more than 90% of Indian companies.
To give relief to lower-middle-income households, the income tax for individuals earning between 250,000 and 500,000 rupees (US$3,725–$7,450) annually will be reduced by 50%.
State elections are key litmus test for Modi’s popularity
State elections to send candidates to India’s parliament began February 4. Elections are being held in five key states, including Uttar Pradesh, a northern state with approximately 200 million people, and Punjab, an agricultural hub in the south that is home to roughly 27 million people.
In my view, Prime Minister Modi gained political capital ahead of the elections and has sold the narrative of demonetization quite well. The currency recall was seen by the broader middle class as an attack on corrupt businessmen and the rich.
After meeting with various business leaders during my field visits, I believe there is hope that demonetization will level the playing field and companies that have survived on tax evasion will no longer be able to do so. I believe the Modi government continues to enjoy widespread political support from all cross sections of Indian society — even in southern India, not a traditional stronghold for Modi’s party, known as the BJP.
Of course, we will know for sure on March 11, when election results are announced. It is important to note that state elections are won or lost on local issues, and are rarely seen as a referendum on the performance of the central government. However, this year the results will be read as a verdict on demonetization.

There is an interesting disconnect these days between political uncertainty and market volatility.
When history seems to offer little guidance, financial markets take time to adjust and have a bias toward not changing.
The key to successful investing in these times is for active managers to maintain enough portfolio flexibility to respond rapidly when the uncertainty starts to resolve.
In the short time since the new U.S. presidential administration was installed, there has been a flurry of policy announcements, and even more policy speculation, spanning a multitude of areas. In the process, an interesting disconnect has emerged between the political and financial worlds.
Much of the political news gives an impression of chaos and uncertainty, whereas financial markets have remained liquid and orderly, risky asset prices have remained well supported — and in most cases have actually strengthened — and market-based measures of uncertainty, such as the VIX, have remained low. (The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, measures the implied volatility of the Standard & Poor’s 500.)
This disconnect exists at a more granular level, as well. For example, the so-called “border adjustment tax,” which in effect subsidizes exports and penalizes imports, should play a central role in a revenue-neutral corporate tax reform package, and would in theory have a significant impact. It should lead to a substantial appreciation of the U.S. dollar, it should be detrimental to low-end retailers who rely heavily on global supply chains, and so on.
The role of active management
But financial markets do not incorporate these expectations. Equity prices reflect a high probability of corporate tax reform, yet forward exchange rates have not adjusted much, and retail stocks have not underperformed a great deal either. There are several other examples of the market’s underreaction to policy announcements that should in theory have a significant impact on specific groups of companies.
It would not be quite right to conclude that markets are not efficient. Rather, in periods of high policy uncertainty, and when history seems to offer little guidance, markets take time to adjust. In the meantime, they have a bias toward not changing until uncertainty is resolved – either because policy is clarified, or because an adverse shock materializes.
This tendency toward inertia is exacerbated by the inclination of many active managers to focus on peer risk rather than absolute risk. There is little incentive to take large portfolio positions with limited information, which may be hard to justify to clients, when the costs of being wrong are potentially high.
In other words, especially in an environment of regime change and high policy uncertainty, market efficiency is not instantaneous, but a process. This creates room for active management to add value. However, that should not imply that all active managers will succeed. In fact, there has been a gradual rise in the dispersion between active managers since mid-2015.
Investment implications
The key to successful active management in periods of elevated uncertainty is not to stake everything on single-point forecasts. Rather, it is the ability to apply detailed policy analysis to a range of scenarios, and to maintain enough portfolio flexibility to respond rapidly and with high conviction as soon as uncertainty starts to resolve itself toward a specific outcome. Furthermore, the ability to populate the portfolio with diversified investment ideas, rather than a few macro positions, is essential if managers hope to generate alpha while keeping active risk under control.
Market liquidity has been good. Investor flows can be invested rapidly and efficiently. But can they be invested wisely when we know so little about the future? They can – but only through an investment process that is solidly grounded in fundamentals, granular enough to generate diversified ideas, forward- rather than backward-looking, and not too strongly anchored to preconceptions about how economic policy and financial markets must function. Advisors should ensure that their clients have exposure to a broadly diversified set of investment themes and can benefit from active management that can respond with agility and flexibility to a rapidly changing policy environment.

Here’s a first: By 2025, 4.2 billion people out of a global population of 7.9 billion will be part of the consuming class.
That means, for the first time in history, the number of people with discretionary income will exceed the number still struggling to meet basic needs — a phenomenon that may well be the biggest opportunity in the history of capitalism.
From the United States to China, consumer spending, long a driver of the global economy, is undergoing sweeping change. Whether it’s millennials in the U.S. or families in India, a shift in the way people spend money is underway globally.
In 2015, Americans spent more than $11 trillion, accounting for two-thirds of the nation’s gross domestic product. But the way Americans spend money is changing. Since 2000, there has been a rotation in spending away from goods and towards services, especially travel and leisure.
That dynamic may also be at work in China, as the country continues on the path to having the world’s largest consumer economy. Consumers there are starting to spend less money on necessities and more money on activities such as family trips and going to the movies.
Demographics will have a major impact on the future of the global economy, particularly due to the aging of millennials, who were born from 1980 to 2000. There are about 80 million in the U.S., but most of the world’s 2 billion millennials are living in emerging markets. In Brazil, India and China, they outnumber baby boomers.
Globally, millennials are estimated to have a combined spending power of nearly $2.5 trillion. They are about to reach their prime working and spending years, and their impact on the world’s economy could be huge.
Here’s a look at some of the ways people are spending money globally, and what it may mean for investors.
In China, Shopping Is About the Experience
Chinese Consumers Are Expected to Spend $3.6 Trillion This Year
Never underestimate the power of the Chinese consumer. Complex and unpredictable, the 1 billion consumers in China are not exactly clinging to their yuan.
Despite a relatively sluggish economy, the Chinese are projected to spend $3.6 trillion this year, or double what they spent in 2006. They are also expected to increase their spending by 10% a year through the end of the decade. They are not just filling the basket with consumer staples — for some, shopping is about the experience.
Going to the movies and taking family trips abroad have become part of Chinese life. China’s box office revenue is projected to reach $8.4 billion in 2016, and grow to $15 billion in 2020. What Hollywood movie has made the most money in China? Furious 7 took in $391 million at the box office last year.
More than 70 million Chinese tourists spent $292 billion on outbound travel in 2015, or nearly three times the level in 2012. Many of those trips are booked through Ctrip, an online travel firm partly owned by Priceline and Baidu, the Chinese internet search giant. The surge in Chinese outbound travel is a multidecade theme driving structural growth in the airline, gaming and internet industries.
“What we are seeing is that the Chinese are primarily spending their money online, on lifestyle and on experiences,” Capital Group’s China affairs specialist, Andrew Dougherty, says. “From an investment standpoint, these are secular opportunities worth paying attention to. China is the largest e-commerce market in the world and is still growing by double digits.”
“China’s service sector has surpassed the manufacturing and agricultural sectors as the leading sector in the economy and now represents more than half of China’s GDP,” Dougherty says. “So, that’s a good indicator that the economy is rebalancing away from manufacturing and investment and toward services and consumption.”
India May Be an Economic Powerhouse in the Making
The Country May Still Be on the Ground Level as a Consumer Society
India embarked on a journey about 25 years ago, opening its doors to globalization and world markets. Since then, the country has become one of the most important components of the global economy, as India’s growth has overtaken that of fellow Asian giant China.
One of the key components of the country’s economic growth is brisk consumer spending, which propelled growth in India’s economy to 7.6% as of March 31, the end of the country’s fiscal year — the fastest pace in at least four years.
When it comes to being an economic powerhouse, India may just be getting started. The graphic shows that the country still lags much of the world in having items such as refrigerators and air conditioners.
But modernization is progressing at a relatively rapid rate, both in terms of personal consumption and modernizing infrastructure. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, highways, airports and railways are being improved, which could provide opportunities for companies and boost the economy.
India also stands to benefit from a demographic tailwind during the coming decades. India has about 440 million millennials and 390 million members of Gen Z (individuals born after 2000) that make up its 1.3 billion population. Over the next decade, about 150 million new people will enter India’s workforce. That’s about the present size of the entire U.S. labor force. A swelling workforce makes it likely India will continue to be a massive market for consumer companies and a major economic power.
“India has a lot going for it in terms of favorable demographics, the possibility of a downward trend in inflation and a substantial reform agenda. If reforms are forthcoming, its economy could really take off, similar to the way China’s did,” Capital Group portfolio manager Nick Grace says.
Millennials: Aren’t They About Ready to Start Buying … Everything?
Collaborative and Disruptive, Millennials Are Beginning to Flex Their Financial Muscles
Talk about pent-up demand. Millennials have been battered by the Great Recession, swamped with student debt and stuck in their parents’ basements for years. They’ve put off getting married, having kids and buying a car, much less a house. But those days may be coming to an end.
In fact, the members of the biggest generation in U.S. history may be about ready to flex their financial muscles. There are about 80 million millennials in the U.S. alone, and they are already spending at least $600 billion a year.
Millennials are also taking a collaborative and disruptive approach to consumption. Technology has made sharing assets relatively inexpensive and possible on a large scale.
In this sharing economy, people rent rooms, cars or luxury purses directly from each other via the internet. Some companies facilitating this collaborative consumption now have multibillion-dollar market caps, including Airbnb, Uber and HomeAway. By 2025, according to consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, the sharing economy may account for $335 billion in global spending.
While millennials are already a potent force, they will truly come into their own by 2020, when their spending in the United States is expected to reach $1.4 trillion annually. Some of that money may go to purchases that have been put off in the wake of the Great Recession.
As millennials enter their peak home-buying years, for example, their reluctance to enter the housing market could change. The cohort’s size, plus its desire to settle down in the future, could lead to a surge in household formations and home sales.

Consumer confidence usually moves in a similar direction across age brackets, but in the past year the youngest cohort continued to gain confidence, while those aged 55 and over are becoming less optimistic about the U.S. economy. One explanation for the divergence is that Baby Boomers have become more concerned about persistently low interest rates that could limit income in retirement. Millennials will likely be the biggest earners and spenders in the future and are more positive about their prospects as the U.S. economy continues to expand modestly.
Markets have been calm despite an uncertain economic and political environment
There has been no shortage of political drama over the past several months — the U.S. election results, Brexit, and this past weekend’s French elections, to name a few. But if the old adage that markets hate uncertainty is true, they aren’t showing it.

The so-called Brexit vote is a significant challenge to the EU’s authority and threatens to further destabilize Europe at a time when weak economic growth and high debt levels are already straining intergovernmental relations.
Brexit opponents argue that leaving the EU would trigger an economic catastrophe by voiding trade agreements and other measures that allow the free flow of capital and people throughout Europe. Brexit supporters say the U.K. has essentially given up its sovereignty to the EU and no longer has enough control over its own laws. Immigration policy, in particular, has been at the center of the debate.
Recent polls show that Brexit support is on the rise, but the outcome remains in doubt and the uncertainty is expected to fuel near-term market volatility. That is especially true in the currency market — the pound sterling has declined sharply at times amid fears of a messy U.K. departure. According to several recent polls, the margin between “remain” and “leave” is tight and there are many “undecided” voters in the mix.
“Traditionally in referendums, there is a ‘status-quo bias’ because undecided voters tend to favor certainty,” says Talha Khan, a political economist based in the Capital Group London office. “While that will most likely hold true in this referendum, the result may ultimately hinge on voter turnout. The higher the turnout, the more likely the ‘remain’ campaign will prevail. If the turnout is low, then the more emotional ‘leave’ campaign could deliver a shock outcome.”
Political and investment implications
In the event that Britain decides to leave the European Union, uncertainty would reign in the political arena and financial markets, likely hurting key areas of the economy such as business investment, consumer confidence, the currency and foreign direct-investment flows. Moreover, the withdrawal of a large, established member from the EU has never been tested before so there is no roadmap to follow.
A formal exit could take at least two years to complete, and there may be little change to the U.K.’s formal relations with the EU during that period. Adjustments would have to be made to trade policies, immigration laws and financial regulations, among other issues. Restructuring relationships between close political and economic partners is likely to be a challenge due to the intricacy of existing agreements and the importance of maintaining strong ties for all parties involved.
During the negotiation period and beyond, the impact on the U.K. economy and investments could be significant. Already, on a year-to-date basis, the pound has fallen nearly 6% against the euro and about 2% against the U.S. dollar. Although the U.K. is a member of the European Union, it has never adopted the euro as its currency.
“It is hard not to expect further sterling weakness if Brexit were to materialize,” says Philip Chitty, a London-based sovereign debt analyst with Capital Group. “At the same time, the U.K.’s rising current account deficit is another reason to expect sterling to be weaker over the medium term.”
Economic downturn expected
Stock prices in the U.K. and the broader European market may also suffer. European stocks have come under pressure in recent months amid concerns about anemic economic growth, deflationary conditions and negative interest rates in some euro-zone countries. However, U.K. stocks have generated significantly better returns on a year-to-date basis, compared to the wider MSCI Europe Index.
“If Britain were to leave the EU, the next two years would be riddled with concern over bilateral trade and visa negotiations,” says Capital Group equity analyst Natasha Braginsky Mounier. “Neither markets nor families do well under such conditions, so this would probably cause a downturn in spending, home prices and, naturally, equity markets.”
Indeed, British Prime Minister David Cameron said Brexit would devastate the U.K. economy. Under a conservative analysis, the U.K. Treasury has estimated that leaving the EU would trigger a recession in the year following the vote and unemployment would rise by about 520,000. Additionally, the Treasury analysis predicted that Britain’s gross domestic product would fall by about 3.6% after two years and home prices would be roughly 10% lower compared to estimated price levels if the U.K. remained within the EU confines.
Global impact
The International Monetary Fund has warned that a British withdrawal could derail global economic growth, as well. The IMF has already cut this year’s growth forecast for the U.K. economy to 1.9% from its previous forecast of 2.2% on an annualized basis. Brexit supporters, including former London Mayor Boris Johnson, have challenged the accuracy of the U.K. Treasury and IMF numbers, arguing that Britain would benefit from having greater control over its laws and limiting the flow of migrants from other countries.
Meanwhile, the City of London’s status as a global financial center could be diminished by a U.K. exit as well. London is currently home to more than 200 international banks that are attracted to the U.K., in part, by the ability to conduct business seamlessly throughout the European Union. Some of these banks may decide to relocate outside the U.K., taking well-paying jobs with them.
Outside the U.K., European banks in general are another area of concern. Bank earnings likely would be hurt by any sort of economic slowdown. Italian, Portuguese and Spanish banks probably would be the most vulnerable, given the fragile economies where they do business. European bank stocks have already declined sharply in recent months amid negative interest rates in the euro zone and weak economic growth throughout the region.
Shelter from the storm?
While many asset prices could be hurt under a Brexit scenario, high-grade government bonds would likely benefit from a flight-to-safety trend, notes Mark Brett, a fixed income portfolio manager with Capital Group. Those would include U.K. gilts, German bunds and U.S. Treasuries — classic safe-haven assets.
British and German bonds have rallied strongly in the weeks leading up to the vote. While the referendum may be partially fueling this rally, it is also likely a result of an aggressive bond-buying program launched by the European Central Bank. In the days leading up to the June 23 vote, elevated volatility is likely, Mark adds.
“If Brexit does happen, it will provide a short-term shock to the euro zone, with companies delaying capital expenditure and hiring yet again,” Mark says. “Therefore, I am seeking out relatively safer investment options in areas that would be less affected by the departure.”

It’s not necessarily disastrous, but any missing safety feature increases the likelihood of error, which could range from minor to catastrophic. The same is true of retirement plans.
Retirement plans’ safety mechanisms, like auto features, may help participants avoid common errors and uncommon catastrophe. As retirement professionals, I believe it is our responsibility to encourage plan sponsors to use every one of them — including and especially the often-overlooked investment re-enrollment.
What investment re-enrollment is and how it works
Many people mistake investment re-enrollment for auto-enrollment or auto-sweep. Although it relies on similar mechanics, investment re-enrollment is a distinct “safety” feature that may help reduce DIY investing errors.
What it does: All participants’ assets and future contributions are automatically moved into the plan’s default investment option, usually a target date fund — unless they opt out.
When it happens: Re-enrollment could be annual, bi-annual or every third year.
How it works: The plan team works with the recordkeeper to set trade dates and distribute communications.
Why it exists: The goal is to help plan participants stay on track through retirement with well-diversified, age-appropriate portfolios.
Helps prevent one-and-done investing disasters
Consequences of non-participation in a plan are easy to see. A young professional buried under mountains of student debt opts out of the company plan. Auto-enrollment prevents that opt-out from being a permanent decision. But what if, instead of opting out, they join the plan with a flawed understanding of investment risk and return? As they try to sort through confusing investment options, they may choose the lowest-risk, most conservative investments.
Remember, the concept of loss aversion tells us that investors are more motivated by fear of losses than they are by anticipation of gains. If a participant makes a fear-based allocation, they risk missing valuable gains during their peak earning years. Investment re-enrollment prevents that from being a one-and-done decision. Unfortunately, investment re-enrollment remains under-utilized.
Under-utilized in plan menus
Despite investment re-enrollment’s power to help divert DIY investment disasters, plan sponsors often opt to forgo this important safety feature. According to the Callan 2022 Defined Contribution Trends Survey, the vast majority of plan sponsors are neither employing nor considering investment re-enrollment, which the study refers to as asset re-enrollment. Only 14% of plan sponsors indicated they had conducted one, and 82% responded “No, and not planning to.”
Have you conducted an asset re-enrollment?
Source: Callan 2022 Defined Contribution Trends Survey. Conducted in the fall of 2021, the survey incorporated responses from 101 plan sponsors, 97% of which had over $100 million in assets.
Why don’t more employers conduct investment re-enrollments? Among the reasons given most often by those surveyed were that it’s unnecessary, not a priority and too much potential fiduciary liability. I disagree with all three.
Reasons for not conducting re-enrollment

Not only is it necessary to help guide investors away from critical errors, but one could argue that it’s a retirement plan professional’s responsibility to leverage every tool available to do so.
Investment re-enrollment is easy
Although sponsors may perceive investment re-enrollment as too much work, the reality is that it’s a fairly simple process. Talk with your recordkeeper, as most will already be able to help you implement this feature.

Even unlikely scenarios change lives
Some plan sponsors may not be convinced that investment re-enrollment is necessary, because investing disasters may seem like an outside chance. But for individual investors, the stakes are high. Let me tell you a story — one I might not believe if I hadn’t witnessed it.
At the end of an educational meeting for plan participants, an employee approached the HR director. This employee had been with the company for around 40 years. He said, “Sorry, I’m not good with all this internet stuff. Could you help me check my 401(k) balance?” The HR director pulled up his account. The balance was $0. He had never set up contributions, and now he was near retirement with no savings. It was heartbreaking to see and a good reminder that a risk that seems “unlikely” to a plan administrator could be a catastrophic outcome to a retirement investor.
As retirement plan professionals, what you do matters. We should be using every tool available to help protect participants, not forgoing critical safety features. Talk to plan sponsors, and use resources like this guide to a successful re-enrollment to help plan participants stay on track through retirement.

330,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/ir-plan-review-tips.html,Plan review tips for a unique year in the market,Defined Contribution,"January 18, 2023","Annual plan reviews play a critical role in maintaining the health of a retirement plan. But this year’s plan review may take on a different dynamic than in recent years. Given declines in both stocks and fixed income, participants may be seeing something they haven’t in a while — or ever, depending on their age — negative investment returns in their 401(k) accounts.
Put yourself in the shoes of plan sponsors
While market declines may be first and foremost in the minds of many plan sponsors, successful plan reviews start with thinking about a client’s point of view and the plan’s objectives. Use this time to reconnect with your clients and take a temperature check on how they, and their business, have fared over the past year or more.
Did they thrive during this period of time or were they challenged? Did higher costs cause struggles in the business or was keeping good people top of mind? Has their company returned to in-person work or are they still maintaining a virtual environment, or a combination of the two? While you may not be able to control where you will meet, you can control how clients will be met.
Revisiting roles and responsibilities
The role of the financial professional (FP) has always been an integral part of running a 401(k) plan. But in a rapidly changing environment, that role is shifting to become an extension of the plan sponsor. As a result, many FPs are spending more time and resources to help sponsors monitor plan health and ensure it is operating effectively.
With all the changes happening in the retirement industry, FPs should be proactively educating their clients about them. FPs can’t afford to be reactive: A recent survey of plan sponsors found that nearly half (47%) are considering changing their FP, marking an all-time high.* FPs should control the narrative before it is dictated by someone else. Now might be a good time to remind clients of all you do to help provide the best retirement plan possible.
That’s why determining how well your client’s retirement plan operates — including who provides each service — matters. Service providers should work in tandem to meet the plan’s goals, and the annual review is an ideal time to revisit their roles and responsibilities. The graphic below illustrates some of the common service providers involved with running a plan. You can also share our handout on how to evaluate service providers.

Working together to meet plan goals
Don’t be afraid to review the investment menu
While the investment lineup doesn’t fall under the category of service provider, it plays a critical role in the success of the plan. As the chart below shows, investment returns — not participant contributions — are the primary engine that drives participant outcomes over the long term. You can watch the returns story unfold through this video illustration.
So returns matter, especially when measured by rolling returns, which may be a more in-depth gauge of long-term returns as opposed to trailing returns. The most critical factor bridging the gap between what participants save and what they’ll need in retirement lies in the quality of the returns their plan’s investments can generate.
Returns matter more than you think
By the time participants retire, as much as 70% of their account value could come from returns, not contributions.
The demographic assumptions, returns, and ending balance are hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to provide any assurance or promise of actual returns and outcomes. Returns will be affected by the management of the investments and any adjustments to the assumed contribution rates, salary, or other participant demographic information. Actual results may be higher or lower than those shown. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods. Based on the exhibit by CBS Moneywatch. Assumptions for 70/30 rule of thumb: This hypothetical example assumes a participant started investing 10% of their $40,000 income at age 26. And then continues to contribute 10% each year throughout their career, as salary increases by 3% a year.
The majority of plan sponsors say their financial professional demonstrates the greatest value by evaluating fund performance, according to proprietary research conducted by Chatham Partners on behalf of Capital Group. Now, with U.S. stocks and bonds officially in bear market territory, it may be more important than ever to reevaluate the funds in the plan’s lineup.
According to the Plan Sponsor Council of America (PSCA), the average number of funds on the menu reached 21 in the 2020 plan year, the first increase in over 10 years. But is that too many? When it comes to the investment menu, simplicity is better. For each fund on the menu, consider some of the following questions:
Why was it chosen in the first place?
Is it meeting its objectives?
Have the results been challenged? If so, can they be deemed reasonable? Or was it a major surprise?
Have they been resilient the times following the periods they've lagged in previous downturns?
When discussing investment results, consider looking at rolling returns. Trailing returns can vary greatly from month to month, especially during periods of volatility. This variation can cause funds to be evaluated differently depending on the particular month the review takes place. Rolling returns, however, can provide a better measure of consistency, as they average multiple periods.
While plan sponsors and financial professionals cannot control the market, they do have control over choosing funds for their plan menus that have potential to withstand market volatility.
Spotlight on participants
While it’s important for you to reconnect with your clients, it’s just as important for you and the plan sponsor to check in with their employees. After all, the employees are the ultimate beneficiaries of the retirement plan.
Since the great financial crisis, financial wellness has become a hot topic in the financial industry. It might be easy to talk about financial wellness when markets are steadily rising as they have for more than a decade. But consider that many participants may be experiencing sustained volatility and losses for the first time. For example, many participants started working around the time of the 2008 financial crisis and perhaps didn’t have much in retirement savings.
Now, those same participants have likely built up their retirement balances and may be worried about losses. With all major U.S. stock indexes finishing down for 2022, it's important to speak to those people that have never experienced it before and guide them. This may help you stand out as a leader – especially in the eyes of plan sponsor clients.

332,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/retirement-plan-regulatory-update.html,Washington watch: Legislation affecting 401(k) plans in 2023,Regulation & Legislation,"December 23, 2022","On December 13, Capital Group’s Reagan Anderson, senior vice president of government relations, and Jason Bortz, senior counsel, presented their overview of legislation and regulation that may affect retirement plan professionals in 2023. The annual retirement plan webinar covered such topics as the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act 2.0 and the recent environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment rule from the Department of Labor (DOL).
Here are the key takeaways.
With split Congress, Democrats may rely on agencies
Following the November midterm election, Democrats will maintain a narrow lead in the Senate, and Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives in January. Because a split Congress increases the difficulty of passing legislation, Anderson explained the Democrats will likely rely on agencies to advance their agenda over the next two years.
SECURE Act 2.0 could pass by end of 2022
Both Bortz and Anderson expressed optimism about the possibility of the SECURE Act 2.0 passing before the end of 2022. This is due to broad bipartisan support of the bill, the imminent retirement of two key appropriators — particularly longtime retirement plan activist Robb Portman of Ohio — and the potential of attaching SECURE 2.0 to the pending omnibus spending bill.
“The work has been done, the bill is paid for, they’re meeting daily, [and both parties are] so committed to getting this retirement package done,” said Anderson, indicating the path should be clear for passage this session.
While it’s important to point out that nothing is yet certain, Bortz outlined key provisions he expects to see in the final package:
Roth 401(k) expansion. This provision would require catch-up contributions to be done on a Roth basis, which would mean that “pretty much every 401(k) in the country is going to have to have a Roth feature,” said Bortz. The package may also require the option for employer contributions to be classified as Roth.
Tax credit to incentivize new plan formation. This provision would increase the small-business (up to 100 employees) startup tax credit from 50% to 100% of the first three years of employer contributions.
Mandatory auto-enrollment and auto-escalation for startup plans. Any new plan would be required to auto-enroll employees at 3%. They would then be auto-escalated 1% annually, up to 10%. Current plans would not be subject to this mandate.
Emergency savings plan. Companies would be allowed to offer an emergency savings plan linked to an employee’s retirement savings plan.
DOL’s new ESG rule is not a sea change
In November 2022, the DOL issued its final rule on ESG investing. While press coverage has indicated that the DOL is now allowing Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) fiduciaries to offer ESG investments, Bortz noted the coverage has been misleading. In Bortz’s words, the guidance “is not a sea change” and does not negate the DOL’s commitment to the primacy of risk and return factors in investment decisions. Rather, the new rule allows that ESG factors may materially affect risk and return and could be considered in that light. 
According to the Employee Benefits Security Administration in “The Federal Register,” the official journal of the U.S. government, on December 1, 2022:
“The Department has a longstanding position that ERISA fiduciaries may not sacrifice investment returns or assume greater investment risks as a means of promoting collateral social policy goals.”
Watch for crypto guidance and more to come
Finally, Bortz and Anderson shared predictions for 2023. In the wake of an eventful fourth quarter for cryptocurrency, Anderson anticipates guidance on crypto investments to be forthcoming. “It’s hard for me to imagine a scenario in which Congress does not pass some sort of regulatory framework for crypto exchanges and for that industry,” she said.
Bortz noted that the DOL could potentially reintroduce a fiduciary rule proposal. If so, he does not anticipate it will be as disruptive as the Obama-era proposal, though it may yet affect rollover recommendations.
Anderson anticipates “a lot of noise on Capitol Hill” about ESG in 2023, with the potential for hearings and “a spotlight on the asset management industry that we’ve never seen before.” This is due to activity at state levels, such as state pensions divesting from companies due to their energy policies.

334,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/ir-different-approach-401k-discussion.html,A different approach to this year’s fee discussion,Fiduciary Responsibility,"December 13, 2022","Retirement plan fees have long been an important touchpoint in annual 401(k) plan reviews, particularly with the numerous excessive-fee lawsuits in recent years. Now with heightened market volatility and inflationary pressures, 401(k) fees have taken on even more scrutiny as sponsors seek to make every dollar they spend count as much as possible.
As reviews approach, are you using all the tools in your toolbox to manage what could be challenging conversations? One idea you may not have considered is to demonstrate the potential tax advantages to employers that come from how plan expenses are paid.
Many 401(k)s are reflexively set up to pass on some plan costs to participants. And some plan sponsors may be unaware that other options exist. But paying some or all plan expenses out of company funds can have benefits for both employers and employees.
Tax savings for employers
Some out-of-pocket plan fees are tax-deductible expenses, such as recordkeeping, fiduciary services, plan administration and possibly financial professional compensation. Startup plans may also qualify for a tax credit. The SECURE Act significantly increased the tax credit from a maximum of $500 a year to $250 for each non-highly compensated employee who is eligible to participate in the plan, up to $5,000 a year.
Potential for improved retirement outcomes
By transferring some costs to business owners, participants will have lower fees, allowing them to save more for retirement. Furthermore, in small plans, the business owner often has the largest account balance. As a result, their accounts pay a big chunk of fees from plan assets. Business owners can avoid this issue — and keep more of their retirement savings growing through the power of compounding — by paying 401(k) administration fees from company assets.
In the hypothetical example below, the employer pays $11,000 of annual plan costs out of company assets instead of them being deducted from participant account balances. Over 20 years, the employer tax deductions amount to $220,000. Because participants didn’t have to pay plan costs, that money remained in their accounts and, with growth, added up to an extra $543,530 after 20 years. This additional accumulation may make a meaningful difference in the quality of retirement for participants.
Tax savings for employer, increased assets for employees
Assumes $1 million in plan assets, 30 participants, $11,000 in annual plan costs and an 8% annual investment growth rate over 20 years
This hypothetical example was developed by third-party retirement plan consultant Patrick Shelton, GBA and managing member of Benefits Plans Plus, LLC. The example assumes annual recordkeeping costs of $4,000, annual advisor costs of $5,000 and annual TPA costs of $2,000. To estimate the increase of participant balances, one-fourth of $11,000 ($2,750) is invested quarterly with an annual growth rate of 8% compounded quarterly over 20 years. Sponsors can elect whether or not to pay plan expenses each year, depending on business conditions. For illustrative purposes only and not intended to portray actual investment results.
Reduced litigation risk
Finally, as the flurry of excessive fee litigation indicates, paying excessive fees is a major source of fiduciary liability. But paying plan costs with company assets can help sponsors reduce the potential for excessive-fee claims.
A win-win for sponsors and participants
As fees remain under scrutiny, are the plan’s expenses too much for it to absorb? Try externalizing them and using company assets to pay for some of them. As a plan’s financial professional, you also have options. Some plan professionals maintain asset-based fees while others change a flat-dollar fee, outside of the plan. There are many choices available to consider. Check with your specific firm for information on billing and plan compensation guidelines.

335,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/ir-401k-fund-selection-bear-markets.html,Selecting 401(k) plan funds to weather a bear market,Defined Contribution,"November 15, 2022","With stocks and bonds falling in tandem, markets are officially in bear market territory, and 401(k) plan participants are likely wondering how their investments will respond. Amid increased volatility and many economists now forecasting an increased probability of a recession, managing risk in retirement plans is just as, if not more, important than ever. While plan sponsors and financial professionals cannot control the market, they do have control over choosing funds for their plan menus that have potential to withstand market gyrations.
Risk matters in retirement plans
The idea of risk management in retirement plans might not typically be top of mind. But a recent study by MetLife found that more than half of plan sponsors (52%) are concerned about the effect of volatility on plan participants that are at least 10 years away from retirement. The percentage increases to 67% and 70% for those within 10 years of retirement and those already in retirement, respectively.
Plan sponsor concerns around participants' ability to weather impact of market volatility
Source: MetLife, ""2022 Stable Value Study.""
Risk can be a disruptor for participants: Near-retirees may have to delay retirement, and retirees may have to cut spending or even return to the workforce. Younger participants could panic and move into very conservative investments, or even worse, may stop contributing all together.
That’s why it’s critical to help plan sponsors find funds that can help preserve participants’ balances amidst volatile markets while helping them benefit from their upside.
What to consider when making fund selections
To find out which strategies may have the potential to help participants weather down markets, we spent years examining factors that have contributed to better-than-peer and better-than-benchmark results.
Our research identified three common traits that consistently enhanced outcomes:
Strong downside capture: Downside capture ratio measures a fund’s results relative to its benchmark during periods of market weakness. The lower the ratio, the better the fund held up during market declines. Active funds that have exhibited strong downside capture ratios in previous periods held up better in future down markets and, on average, delivered better long-term results.
Low expenses: We found that funds that have lower fees than their peers, specifically funds that offer fees in the least expensive quartile, have the potential to deliver better participant outcomes. Ongoing annual expenses can have an impact on long-term results, and ultimately, participant outcomes.
High level of firm manager ownership: We believe funds managed by portfolio managers with a high level of firm manager ownership in the fund signal high conviction in investment strategies and ideas. And it represents an alignment of interests between fund managers and participants investing in the fund.
Select equity-focused active funds had enhanced outcomes for the 26 years ending December 31, 2021
Sources: Capital Group, Morningstar. Covers the period of January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2021. Screens were based on historical fund performance in comparison with peer median. Best downside capture was defined as top 50%. Best expense ratio and best manager ownership were defined as top 25% for the U.S. large cap category (owing to its larger sample size) and top 50% for the other categories. Large-cap stocks are defined as the group that accounts for the top 70% of the capitalization of the Morningstar domestic stock universe. Foreign large-cap stocks have market caps in the top 70% of each economically integrated market (such as Europe or Asia ex-Japan); these portfolios typically will have less than 20% of assets invested in U.S. stocks. Moderate-allocation portfolios seek to provide both capital appreciation and income by investing in three major areas: stocks, bonds, and cash. These portfolios tend to hold larger positions in stocks than conservative-allocation portfolios. These portfolios typically have 50% to 70% of assets in equities and the remainder in fixed income and cash. World-stock portfolios have few geographical limitations. It is common for these portfolios to invest the majority of their assets in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, with the remainder divided among the globe's smaller markets. These portfolios typically have 20%-60% of assets in U.S. stocks.
*Comparisons used an asset-weighted methodology. This method can increase comparability between portfolios as compared with an equal-weighted methodology.
What this means for participants
So how can these three intuitive traits — strong downside capture, low expenses and high level of manager ownership — translate into better participant outcomes? To find out, we looked at hypothetical participant scenarios in both accumulation and withdrawal phases.
In the hypothetical example below, we found that over a 26-year accumulation period, a hypothetical $100,000 investment in an equal blend of the U.S. large cap and foreign large cap funds that possessed these three key traits would have delivered 20% greater wealth than the index.
The potential for greater wealth in the accumulation phase ...
Sources: Capital Group, Morningstar. Time period from 1996 to 2021. Index core consists of 50% S&P 500 and 50% MSCI ACWI ex USA, rebalanced monthly. Screened active portfolio consists of 50% U.S. large cap and 50% foreign large cap. U.S. large cap funds compromise those in the top 25% of lowest expense and highest firm manager ownership of funds after top 50% downside capture filter. Foreign large cap funds have the top 50% lowest expenses and highest 50% firm manager ownership of funds after top 50% downside capture filter. Screened active managers use the oldest share class. The funds in the hypothetical portfolio were equal weighted at the beginning of the period and rebalanced monthly. New funds that incepted during the period and funds that went obsolete (merged or liquidated) during the period were included or excluded in the monthly rebalance, respectively. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
… and where risk really matters: in retirement
The lower risk approach made the differences even larger in the distribution phase. The below chart depicts three hypothetical withdrawal scenarios over 26 years in retirement, all starting with a $500,000 nest egg, with initial withdrawal rates of 3%, 4% and 5%. In all three hypothetical scenarios, there would have been substantial appreciation beyond the original principal.
Source: Capital Group, Morningstar. Return of a hypothetical $500,000 initial investment, assuming an initial percentage withdrawal rate, increasing by 3% each year thereafter for inflation, for a 50% moderate allocation/50% world allocation portfolio. For the 26 years ending December 31, 2021. Index comprises 60% MSCI All Country World Index and 40% Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index. Screened active comprises a 50% moderate allocation and 50% world allocation. World allocation and moderate allocation use top 50% expense ratio and top 50% ownership after top 50% downside capture filter. The funds in the hypothetical portfolio were equal weighted at the beginning of the period and rebalanced monthly. New funds that incepted during the period and funds that went obsolete (merged or liquidated) during the period were included or excluded in the monthly rebalance, respectively. Screened active managers use oldest share class. There may have been periods when the fund(s) lagged the index(es). Market indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
The above chart shows an assumed inflation rate of 3%. Imagine the impact on risk of today’s much higher inflation rate, especially if it persists for a significant period of time.
At a 3% initial withdrawal rate, the participant withdrew over $500,000 and would have ended up with 35% greater wealth than the index. At the higher 5% rate, the participant took out over $900,000 from that same $500,000 starting point and would have ended up with 132% greater wealth than the index. If they were to try to do this with the index, they would have less money than their initial investment.
Better investment decisions drive better participant outcomes
While past results are no guarantee of similar results in future periods, these differences can be meaningful for retirees. Even a slightly higher annual return combined with greater downside protection can dramatically extend a participant’s retirement savings, providing them with more flexibility to deal with inflation and unexpected health care expenses and even the potential to leave a legacy for the next generation. With all this in mind, investment selection might be the most important decision you can help plan sponsors make.

Asset weighting methodology: Where noted, findings were based on asset weighting of funds rebalanced monthly, with portfolios equally weighted and rebalanced monthly. Asset weighting used the following process. For each fund, net returns and asset sizes were gathered for all share classes available during each monthly time period. Returns and fees were then share-class weighted, meaning they were weighted according to the proportion of assets in each share class within each fund. Funds were then designated as active or passive, then grouped by Morningstar category.
Additionally, for exhibits with time periods starting 1996 or later, survivorship bias — the tendency for obsolete funds to be excluded from results studies because they no longer exist — is corrected by including the return and expense history of funds that have merged or closed. (Exhibits with time periods before 1996 reflect either live funds only or a combination of both data types: live funds only and survivorship bias free.) In cases where a fund is merged or closed, its asset weighting is adjusted to zero. For newly created funds, the weight is zero until the period in which it has reported assets, whereupon we use the standard asset-weighting to weight the returns based on asset size.
An asset-weighting methodology is used to more effectively portray the likely experience of market participants in the analyzed period versus an equal-weighting methodology, which is more appropriate when analyzing performance of a specific fund over time, regardless of the size of its assets.
Capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund versus index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).

336,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/framework-address-retirees-biggest-fear.html,A framework to address retirees’ biggest fear,Retirement Planning,"November 9, 2022","Of all the fears that keep retirees up at night, one of the biggest might be the fear of running out of money. Questions like “How long will I live?”, “Will my investments hold up?” and “Will unexpected costs or events erode my savings?” speak to this fear.
Answering these questions is a central challenge of the retirement industry today. At Capital Group, home of American Funds, we encourage retirees and financial professionals to think less about retirement assets as one lump sum that must cover all expenses, as many do, and instead to think more about a ‘building blocks’ approach. This approach means allocating assets to blocks aligned with personal retirement objectives. Four blocks frequently prioritized by retirees are basic living expenses, discretionary expenses, unplanned emergencies and leaving a legacy.
The building blocks of a confident retirement
We believe that thinking about asset allocation in terms of building blocks can help retirees adopt a mental accounting framework for their assets — making it easier to understand, quantify and prioritize their retirement spending and legacy objectives. Our approach has been informed by in-depth qualitative research conducted for Capital Group, including interviews with hundreds of retirees and near-retirees.1
1. Living: Are the essentials covered?
Living expenses typically include day-to-day necessities such as food, housing, transportation and health care. While investors may have some flexibility with meeting these types of expenses over time, many may seek 100% confidence in meeting them at the outset.
2. Lifestyle: What are your optional expenses?
The lifestyle block includes discretionary spending — the spending you can live without if necessary, such as travel, spending on grandchildren, dining out and entertainment. What constitutes a lifestyle expense will vary from retiree to retiree, as will their comfort level with variations in income and spending as their lifestyle evolves over retirement.
3. Emergency: Do you have a cash cushion?
An emergency fund can provide retirees with more confidence in their ability to weather unexpected market, health or household expenses. Investors should plan for the unexpected and have ample cash and/or more readily liquid reserves on hand.
4. Legacy: Do you plan to pass on your wealth?
For some, leaving a legacy is a defining goal of a wealth planning strategy. Many others simply plan to leave behind “whatever is left” after also accounting for living and lifestyle expenses in a single portfolio of assets invested together to balance income, growth and capital preservation objectives.
This hypothetical scenario is shown for illustrative purposes only, is not indicative of any specific investment and does not reflect the impact of fees, expenses or taxes that may be owed.
Putting the building blocks into action
What is the optimal withdrawal rate for a couple’s retirement portfolio? In the above hypothetical example, Harry and June used the four-building-blocks framework when discussing their spending goals and available resources with their financial professional.
Their annual basic living expenses are $40,800. They would like to set an objective to achieve 100% confidence in meeting these essential living expenses over their lives.
They desire $27,200 annually for their lifestyle expenses in retirement. Since they have more flexibility in achieving this spending goal, they agree that 75% confidence in reaching it is appropriate, given that the portfolio needs to balance income, growth and asset preservation.
They have cash savings of $45,000 in their emergency fund for any unforeseen expenses.
They would like to leave a legacy for their children, which would include the family home valued at $500,000.
Their $1,000,000 portfolio would need to generate $40,000 ($68,000 less $28,000 from Social Security) to cover both their living expenses and desired lifestyle spending — a 4% withdrawal rate.
Testing the income plan against multiple outcomes
To stress-test this 4% withdrawal rate’s ability to confidently support both living and lifestyle expenses, their financial professional looked at a Monte Carlo simulation, which calculates probabilities based on a number of hypothetical return scenarios. Since Harry and June were most concerned with downside risks, the simulation focused on the lowest 10th percentile of possible outcomes.
According to the simulation, the standard 4% withdrawal rate may be too ambitious in this case. With the proposed split between living and lifestyle expenses, weighted for a combined success rate of 90%, the simulation shows a withdrawal rate of 3.55% or less would provide more confidence in sustaining their spending needs. The analysis suggests that Harry and June’s financial professional may need to discuss with them the trade-offs and implications of decreasing their spending objectives, delaying retirement and adjusting their portfolio, as well as exploring opportunities to increase their level of protected income to improve their overall confidence in retirement.
Retirement income confidence (30-year time horizon)
A Monte Carlo simulation was used to calculate the probable range of outcomes for a hypothetical portfolio composed of 60% global stocks and 40% U.S. bonds supporting the withdrawal rates indicated in the chart for 30 years.  Withdrawals are increased by 2% per year. For further information about the assumptions used to create this chart, please see the next page.

Note: Taxes and fees not considered in this hypothetical.
Building retirement confidence — one client at a time
Given the many unknowns of retirement, a building blocks framework may help investors better define their retirement income needs. With insights gleaned from this framework and the benefit of professional advice, investors should be able to invest in portfolios that align with their desired lifestyle and legacy goals and objectives as they navigate through retirement. For financial professionals, that means creating portfolios designed to help clients pursue overall income security, meet their essential living expenses no matter how long they live, and invest for a high degree of confidence.

A Monte Carlo simulation was used to calculate the probable range of outcomes and probabilities for hypothetical portfolio reliance. A Monte Carlo simulation is a statistical technique that, through a large number of random scenarios, calculates a range of outcomes that are based on a set of assumptions. This simulation is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended to provide any assurance of actual results.
The following assumptions were used in the Monte Carlo simulation:
The investor withdraws a fixed percentage of the initial portfolio value each year for up to 30 years. The initial withdrawal amount is increased by 2.0% each year.
The hypothetical portfolio is composed of 60% global equities and 40% U.S. fixed income (rebalanced quarterly).
Assumed hypothetical returns for the equities portfolio were 6.4% with a standard deviation of 15.2%; assumed hypothetical returns for U.S. fixed income were 2.6% with a standard deviation of 3.3%.
The portfolio success rate in the hypothetical illustration is the percentage of simulations where the hypothetical portfolio sustained the applicable withdrawal percentage each year for 30 years (inclusive of a 2.0% annual increase). While we believe the calculations to be reliable, we cannot guarantee their accuracy. Simulation results may vary.
All assumptions are for market asset classes only and are reviewed at least annually. These figures represent the views of a small group of investment professionals based on their individual research and are approved by the Capital Market Assumptions Oversight Committee. They should not be interpreted as the view of Capital Group as a whole. As Capital Group employs The Capital SystemTM, the views of other individual analysts and portfolio managers may differ from those presented here. They are provided for informational purposes only and are not intended to provide any assurance or promise of actual returns. They reflect long-term projections of asset class returns and are based on the respective benchmark indices, or other proxies, and therefore do not include any outperformance gain or loss that may result from active portfolio management. Note that the actual results will be affected by any adjustments to the mix of asset classes. All market forecasts are subject to a wide margin of error.
Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility."

The coming wave of retirees will reduce retirement plan assets.
Employers may save money by keeping retirees in their plans.
Keeping retirees “in the family” provides a tangible employee benefit.
Everyone seems to want to help workers save for retirement. Employers encourage participants to use automatic payroll deductions to save as much as they can. Investment managers and the financial media stress the importance of retirement planning. The government has created a whole set of tools – from auto-enrollment to default investments – to increase the nation’s retirement plan savings.
Far less attention is paid to what happens when people actually retire. How do they draw out their funds? What investment changes should they make?
Today, retirees are often on their own to answer these questions – but that could be changing. Both employers and employees are starting to see the value of keeping participants in the plan after they retire.
70 is the new 60 
One factor in this change of thinking is the aging of the workforce. The U.S. Census Bureau expects the number of people over age 65 to increase by more than 40% in the next 20 years, with less projected growth in the 20-64 working age group.
As older participants who have accumulated more assets over time retire and withdraw their accounts, younger workers who have saved less will have to bear more of the plan costs.

Keeping retirees in the plan builds goodwill and helps reduce employer costs
The relatively simple step of encouraging participants to stay in the plan after retirement can be a cost-effective way for plan sponsors to address this challenge.
With high-balance accounts remaining in the plan, the costs of running and maintaining it may stay low. In addition, participants start to view the retirement plan – and their employer – as something they hold on to after they’ve accumulated retirement savings. Thus, they may be more likely to make responsible decisions about when to retire.
Reinforces good investing behaviors. Participants enjoy the continuity of the plan instead of a whole new set of investment decisions at retirement.
Allows the consolidation of retirement plan assets. Participants may be able to “roll-in” savings scattered across former employer plans.
Enables participants to stay with investments they know and prefer. The plan may have investments that retirees like, are familiar with and might not be available elsewhere.
Offers age-appropriate investment options. The plan may offer access to age-specific solutions such as target date funds.
May result in lower costs. Retirees may benefit from institutionally priced investments.
What can sponsors do to retain retirees?
The following action steps can support defined contribution plan participants in retirement:
Work with the recordkeeper. Most plans can facilitate lump-sum and systematic withdrawals, but not all recordkeepers support ad hoc (as needed) participant distributions.
Update employee communications and education materials. A little outreach can help pre-retirees understand the advantages of staying in the plan.
Evaluate core menu and target date options. Investments with historically stable results can help participants as they move from saving to spending.
Consider creating retirement tiers. Plan sponsors may wish to create an additional set of menu choices in their defined contribution plan lineup to address the unique spending requirements of retirees, including options geared toward different rates of withdrawal.
What retirement tiers might look like in a plan
Planning ahead to a post-retirement age
The defined contribution plan was originally designed as a supplemental retirement vehicle – workers’ primary retirement arrangements were defined benefit plans that took care of them through retirement. Now that defined contribution has become established as the predominant retirement plan for American workers, it should transition to a complete retirement system that serves retirees as well as workers.
“As employers think about how to usher employees into retirement,” says Toni Brown, CFA and head of retirement strategy at Capital Group, “they would be well served by looking at retirement not as a finish line but as a transition zone.”

338,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/tips-choosing-hsa-provider.html,10 tips for choosing an HSA provider,Retirement Planning,"November 8, 2022","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
HSAs are a great way of paying for both long- and short-term health care costs.
Employers and employees can “decouple” their HSA from their health insurance plan provider.
A financial professional can help you choose the HSA provider that meets your needs.
What are the two biggest savings requirements of your working years? Health care and retirement. Though employers cover both of these in benefits packages, most people view them as separate expenditures — until, that is, they reach retirement and see how much health care costs affect their retirement standard of living.
That is changing with the emergence of health savings accounts (HSAs), a unique investment strategy that can help pay for the health care–related portion of retirement spending.
Three distinct features expand HSAs from accounts that fund short-term medical expenses into long-term investment vehicles:
Triple-tax-free benefits: Contributions are made pretax, while earnings and distributions of those earnings are tax-free for qualified health care expenses now and in the future. 
“Stow it and grow it” provisions: HSAs can be rolled over from year to year if the savings aren’t spent, unlike “use-it-or-lose-it” flexible savings accounts (FSAs).
Individual control of account: HSAs are individual and self-directed accounts, which means you can move them to and invest them with any HSA provider, not just the one that handles your health insurance.
So how do you make the most of the HSA investment opportunity?
If you are an employee in an HSA-eligible/high-deductible health insurance plan, you can save and invest your HSA assets — the employer and employee contributions — with any provider you choose, not just the one your employer offers. This may provide greater investment opportunity, especially if your employer only offers cash-based or low-return investments from their current HSA provider.
If you are an employer, you may not know that you can expand the range of available investments by decoupling your HSA provider from your high-deductible health plan provider, who may be a health insurer that offers a less robust investment menu.
Here is a handy list of things to look for when choosing an HSA provider. Your financial professional can help you better understand and evaluate your options so you can make the best decision.
HSAs are not one-size-fits-all
HSAs were set up as a way to manage exploding health care costs. As the HSA market grows, people are starting to realize they have more choices — and more opportunity — than they may think. That’s where a financial professional can be crucial. A financial professional can help employers optimize the investment mix in their HSA based on the demographics of the business and help employees make investment decisions that may make the high cost of health care in retirement more manageable.

339,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/3-steps-successful-investment-reenrollment.html,3 steps to a successful investment re-enrollment,Defined Contribution,"October 21, 2022","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Re-enrollment can improve participants’ investment mix.
Planning, fund evaluation and communication are the keys to success.
Better participant allocations could lead to better retirement outcomes.
Investment re-enrollment is a powerful way to give a fresh start to a retirement plan’s participants. This often-overlooked strategy converts their investments quickly and automatically into ones built on sound investment principles – for any participant who needs it.
For the plan sponsor, investment re-enrollment is a simple process by which participants are notified that their current balances and future contributions will be invested in the plan’s default investment (which may be a target date fund). All participants’ assets are automatically moved into the plan's default investment on a certain date unless the participant makes a new investment election during a specified time period.
Although re-enrollment can’t wipe the slate clean of past investing mistakes, it allows participants to correct knotty legacies like investing counter to their goals or age, defaulting into a money market fund or not revisiting the original investments since they were selected. 
Here are three things to look for when designing an investment re-enrollment with a financial professional and recordkeeper. These will help the process go smoother and build a strong foundation for future participant satisfaction.
1. Have a goal in mind
Does the company want to improve participant investment allocations? Are accounts overinvested in money markets or any single investment option? Do individual allocations and the risk associated with them appear misaligned with employees' best interests? 
2. Evaluate your target date
Although investment re-enrollment can be made into any qualified default investment alternative (QDIA), most plans use target date funds for this purpose. Each target date fund represents a fully diversified portfolio that can be assigned to participants based on their age. As retirement approaches, the fund automatically adjusts its asset allocation to help protect retirement income.
Here are some questions to ask when evaluating a target date series:
How is the glide path constructed? Does the investment mix offer meaningful appreciation opportunities early on and enough growth potential and/or retirement income to support participants’ needs after they retire?
Who manages the series? Allocation specialists or a committee of portfolio managers? How much oversight is provided?
What are the underlying funds? Are they quality underlying funds? Are they diversified between equities and fixed income, as well as the types of equity and fixed income, such as dividend-paying stocks and high-yield bonds?
How much do participants pay? How do the expenses compare to other target date series? Do investors receive value in terms of management supervision for what they pay?
What are the results? How has the series done in the last one, three and five years against similar funds? How have the series and its underlying funds done over longer periods?
3. Communicate for impact
Plan communications don’t have to be dry, legalistic documents. The investment re-enrollment notice can grab participants’ attention to make a positive impression. Here are some guidelines:
Explain the benefit. A clear statement of what the investment re-enrollment is trying to accomplish — such as an improvement in participants’ investment allocations — can energize participants around the process.
Announce early and repeat often. Make a “coming soon” announcement 60 to 90 days in advance. Then make sure the actual 30-day notice clearly states that participants have the opportunity to confirm their current investments or use those selected by the plan. Follow up with emails as the re-enrollment period nears its end.
Manage the contact list. Verify current addresses, especially for former employees and beneficiaries. Have a process in place to track undeliverable mail.
Go beyond emails and signs. Use newsletters, texts, calls — even on-site meetings — to encourage participant engagement.
Consider making other plan changes at the same time. Implement other plan improvements, like updating the investment menu, while you have participants’ attention. 
Why investment re-enrollment increases the odds for retirement success
Choosing a mix of investments can be overwhelming. Many participants don’t have the time or knowledge to invest wisely. Thus, if left to their own devices, they often make investment selections that aren’t aligned with their goals. An investment re-enrollment can help participants invest better:
Those who want to make their own investment decisions are encouraged to re-examine and confirm their choices.
Those who do not proactively make investment selections for their assets are moved to the QDIA, usually an age-appropriate target date series.
Investment re-enrollment is one of the five keys to retirement success. It can be surprisingly easy for plan sponsors to use it to help participants open the door to financial security in retirement.

340,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/ir-pooled-employer-plans.html,PEP talk: What to know before jumping into pooled employer plans,Defined Contribution,"October 11, 2022","Summer may be over, but your clients might still be thinking about jumping into a pool — a pooled employer plan, that is.
Historically, an individual employer — no matter how small — has had to set up and run their own individual retirement plan. Regulators and legislators have sought for years to ease this administrative burden by putting multiple employers together into one buying pool — thus offering potential cost savings and reduced legal liability.
Pooled employer plans (PEPs), created under the SECURE Act, are the latest attempt to make 401(k) plans more accessible for small businesses. Rolled out on January 1, 2021, PEPs have gained attention among financial professionals and employers alike but are off to a slower than expected start with only about 100 plan providers registering with the Department of Labor as of September 2022.*
Yet, they are still relatively new and can be complex, leaving many plan sponsors with questions. This provides an opportunity for you to educate yourself and your clients about this emerging strategy before testing the waters.
What are PEPs?
PEPs are an updated version of multiple employer plans (MEPs), which permit unaffiliated businesses to participate in the same retirement plan, but with three key differences:
Removes the requirement that employers share a commonality, such as being part of the same industry or professional organization
Eliminates the “one bad apple” rule, in which all participating employers could bear responsibility if just one employer violates the rules and regulations of the plan
Uses a pooled plan provider (PPP) to run the plan, requires an ERISA 3(16) administrator and typically involves a discretionary investment manager under ERISA 3(38).
The premise (or promise?) of PEPs
Much has been said about the retirement emergency in the United States, especially among small businesses. The vast majority (92%) of businesses with at least 500 employees offer a workplace retirement plan, compared with less than half (46%) of those with fewer than 100 employees.†
Everybody in the pool — what to consider before making the leap
Many smaller employers do not sponsor plans for a variety of reasons, including cost, fiduciary responsibility and administrative burden. But the extent to which PEPs resolve these concerns remains to be seen. Below are some considerations when determining whether PEPs are the right choice for your clients:
PEPs may involve additional costs
Cost is one of the top reasons small-business owners cite for not offering a plan.† One premise of PEPs is that they may be more cost effective because multiple employers pool their assets and can potentially achieve economies of scale. But are PEPs really more cost effective? Consider:
The costs of 3(16) administrative services and a 3(38) investment manager are already built into a PEP. Clients joining the PEP will have to absorb these costs whether or not they want these services. As a result, employers may wind up increasing cost by adding services they don’t really want or need.
PEPs are subject to an annual audit and share the associated costs. If a plan is currently paying for an annual audit, pooling the expense can result in a noticeable cost savings, but it is not typically necessary for single-employer plans with fewer than 100 participants. Given that nearly 90% of all 401(k) plans have fewer than 100 participants, with a PEP, your clients might be potentially sharing the cost of an expense that does not apply to them.
Given that PEPs are still in their infancy, data on costs are not widely available but the chart below shows that the expenses for a single-employer plan are lower compared to MEPs — the predecessor of PEPs.
Average cost of a 401(k) by plan type
Source: Natalya Shnitser. ""Are Two Employers Better Than One? An Empirical Assessment of Multiple-Employer Retirement Plans."" The Journal of Corporation Law 45, no.3 (2020): 743-786. Data refers to 2016 plan fees.
Some fiduciary responsibility and administrative burden may remain
According to a 2022 study by the Secure Retirement Institute (SRI), approximately one-third of plan sponsors cited reduced administrative burden (35%) and reduced legal liabilities (32%) as part of the appeal of PEPs. In a PEP, the PPP will oversee or outsource some of these functions. But there are some caveats with these services that plan sponsors should understand.
Joining a PEP does not completely remove the plan sponsor’s fiduciary liability, as they are still responsible for selecting and monitoring the PPP.
As previously mentioned, administrative and fiduciary services are packaged together and cannot be separated.
Flexibility may be limited
Many pooled arrangements can be restrictive. One of the biggest concerns is lack of control. Cerulli found that 33% of plan sponsors prefer to have a plan that is customized for their employees without constraints.
There is often little or no flexibility when it comes to the investment menu, as the PPP or another 3(38) fiduciary makes the investment choices. These choices will ultimately affect participants’ retirement outcomes, so it’s important that plan sponsors are comfortable with the selections.
Plan design is another area that might have limited flexibility. Plan sponsors will have to think about which plan features they want to offer as there are differences among the offerings across PPPs (e.g., auto features, different vesting schedules, whether to offer loans).
Top three perceived drawbacks/barriers to PEPs among small plan sponsors (<$25 million)
Source: Cerulli Associates, The Cerulli Edge - U.S. Retirement Edition, 1Q 2022. Responses from a proprietary 2021 survey of more than 700 401(k) plan sponsors.
Options outside the pool
While there are aspects of PEPs that make them seem compelling to plan sponsors, there may be another option better suited to them. For example, some of the benefits that appeal to plan sponsors — the potential for lower costs, reduced fiduciary liability and decreased administrative burden — already exist in a traditional single-employer plan structure.
When considering a PEP, ask your clients:
Do you have fewer than 100 employees?
Do you want to have input in your plan’s design?
Do you want to have some say in selecting your plan’s investment options?
Do you want to choose the features and services you pay for and how those costs are paid?
If your client answers yes to any of these questions, a single-employer plan may be a good option to consider. Our recent white paper discusses some of the potential benefits and drawbacks of PEPs versus single-employer plans.
While PEPs address some plan sponsor concerns, the “one-size-fits-all” approach may not actually fit your particular clients’ needs. That’s why it’s a good idea to compare the pros and cons of PEPs versus other solutions in the marketplace. Only leap into a PEP if it’s the best solution for both the participants and plan sponsor.

Focus on participation rate, savings rate and investment results.
Keep retirees in the plan.
Measure, make adjustments and repeat.
To be successful, plan sponsors must address a few key questions about their plans:
What are our success metrics?
How do we measure against them?
What are we doing to improve?
With clear objectives, regular measurement and strategic adjustments, a plan sponsor has the tools to influence participant outcomes.
Success metrics
Focus on three key metrics and action steps to gauge your plan’s success. Note that each plan should develop its own set of goals.
1. Participation rate
Strive for 100% participation. Reach for this by auto-enrolling:
All new employees
Non-participating employees annually
2. Savings rate
Consider setting a savings goal, such as 15% of compensation. Note the percentage of employees who fall below this goal, and examine savings rates from multiple angles, such as:
By age cohort
By tenure
By compensation level
By gender
Consider tactics that could increase rates, such as:
Auto-enrollment (consider enrolling at a 10% contribution rate or more)
Auto-escalation (raising contribution rates each year)
Employer-matching contributions
3. Investment results
Determine whether participants have results comparable to those of the plan’s qualified default investment alternative (QDIA). Evaluate both the average results for participants and differences among demographics.
Seek to improve results by:
Implementing an investment re-enrollment
Evaluating the investment lineup annually
Encouraging roll-ins to create a consolidated retirement picture
Keep retirees in the plan
For the defined contribution system to be a complete retirement program, it needs to address both the saving and spending phases of retirement. Keeping retirees in the plan can be a win-win for both sponsors and retirees.
Retirees benefit from continued access to low-cost investment options as well as fiduciary oversight. Sponsors benefit from the boost in plan assets and therefore economies of scale.
Support keeping retirees in the plan by:
Eliminating withdrawal fees
Allowing flexible withdrawal options (e.g., scheduled and ad hoc withdrawals)
Creating a “retirement tier” in the investment menu with liquid retirement income options
Evaluating the target date fund against retiree needs
Including benefits for retirees in plan communications
To help oversee implementation and measurement, plan sponsors can partner with outside consultants or financial professionals on the plan design and investment menu issues.
Measure, adjust, repeat
Filling in the gap between where the plan is now and where the sponsor wants it to be involves constant measurement and continuous improvement. If the plan falls short of its initial success objectives, sponsors may want to take additional steps to make it stronger. These should then be measured — repeatedly and regularly.
Control what you can
Concerns about participant retirement readiness have driven many plans to take steps such as offering participant education to improve decision-making. The results of such efforts are mixed, because they rely on participant action.
Instead, plan sponsors can help improve participant outcomes by focusing on the things they themselves control.

Although expense ratios matter, a more balanced approach to evaluating fees and net-of-fee results may better serve participants and plan sponsors
While the validity and merit of these new cases have yet to be fully decided, ERISA case law continues to focus on a thoughtful and thorough investment selection process
Few plan sponsors want to fight all the way to a verdict on the merits of ERISA litigation, but would prudent fiduciaries have made a change to a better-performing target date series?
Plan sponsors and consultants have no doubt been watching with interest the latest round of target date fund lawsuits based on BlackRock’s LifePath Index target date series. Over the past month, a growing number of current and former defined contribution plan participants have sued their respective employers, alleging violations due to the poor results of the incumbent target date provider. The defendants in the cases include well-known names like Citigroup, Capital One and Microsoft.1
Plaintiffs claim the defendants selected, retained and/or otherwise ratified poorly performing target date investments instead of offering more prudent alternative target date funds that were readily available, including the American Funds Target Date Retirement Series®. Suits assert that “… as is currently in vogue, Defendants appear to have chased the low fees … without any consideration of their ability to generate return.”2
Similar cases have been filed before. A suit against Berkshire Hathaway’s Marmon Holdings, Inc., claimed that underperforming target date funds in the company’s retirement plan were “left languishing.”3 And last year, in a case against UnitedHealth Group, the judge found it plausible that plan sponsors could be acting imprudently, in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), by continuing to offer lagging target date funds on their investment menus.4 But the new cases are a major wake-up call, given the prominence of the defendants and the sheer number of lawsuits.
Collectively, this could mark a major shift in the theme of ERISA litigation, away from excessive fees to a focus on results. Expense ratios certainly still matter, but a more balanced approach that evaluates both fees and the net-of-fee results that ultimately determine retirement success may better serve participants and sponsors.
This is far from a simple task for target date funds. Nuances abound, from the selection of an appropriate peer group to the isolation of “to” versus “through” glide paths (i.e., paths managed until the retirement target date versus paths that continue to be managed into retirement, respectively) and active versus passive strategies. In the latest cases involving Citigroup and Microsoft, among others, the results of the incumbent provider’s “to” glide path are being compared to the superior results of “through” glide path peers.5,6
It’s arguable that comparisons between target date types such as “to” versus “through” are like comparing apples to oranges. And several recent court decisions have rejected plaintiffs’ claims that active and passive target date strategies are comparable, noting that active strategies have “different aims, different risk and different potential rewards”7 than passive strategies and empower participants “to take on more risk and pay higher fees in the hope of beating the market.”8 It will be interesting to see how the court decides on the “to” versus “through” comparison at stake now.
Moreover, appropriate success metrics evolve over time. For younger investors in further-dated vintages, returns usually matter most, whereas investors in retirement tend to be primarily concerned about volatility and drawdown risk. Risk-adjusted return metrics (such as the Sharpe ratio9) offer a short-hand solution to comparing across vintages, but a more sophisticated multi-factor model that more accurately tracks the evolution of participant needs over time would be best.
While the validity and merit of these new cases have yet to be fully decided, ERISA case law continues to focus on a thoughtful and thorough investment selection process. For example, in July a three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals rejected a class action brought against CommonSpirit Health based, in part, on claims of lagging five-year results. They noted that “[m]erely pointing to another investment that has performed better in a five-year snapshot of the lifespan of a fund that is supposed to grow for fifty years does not suffice to plausibly plead an imprudent decision — largely a process-based inquiry — that breaches a fiduciary duty.”10
So, while process remains the touchstone, the recent surge of performance-related litigation serves as an important reminder that good outcomes, as quantified by solid relative results as well as return and risk-adjusted return ranks, may help mitigate the risks of a lawsuit.
Defendants in the latest cases are likely to file a motion to dismiss to avoid discovery (the fact-finding process that precedes going to trial). It’s common for plans to settle if they can’t get the case dismissed before this stage. Few plan sponsors want to fight all the way to a verdict on the merits of the case. It’s an open question whether the plaintiffs can convince a judge that there’s a legitimate question at stake: Would prudent fiduciaries have made a change to a better-performing target date series?

In fact, proprietary research conducted by Chatham Partners on behalf of Capital Group found that 96% of plan sponsors say they turn to a third party for guidance.
Source: Chatham Partners, ""Assessing How Plan Sponsors Manage Change within Defined Contribution Plans,"" January 2022. Responses to the question, ""Does a third-party intermediary such as an advisor or consultant assist you in the management of your defined contribution retirement plan?""*
And plan sponsors are happy with the job their retirement plan professionals are doing. Of sponsors surveyed by Chatham Partners, 74% said they wouldn’t change any aspects of the support they receive. While this may sound like good news, it may also suggest that plan sponsors don’t fully grasp the value or additional services a financial professional (FP) can offer.
This presents an opportunity. In an increasingly crowded marketplace like the retirement plan business, FPs have the ability to differentiate themselves.
Bring more than fund evaluation
Not surprisingly, plan sponsors cited fund evaluation as the most important value-added service provided by FPs. Still, the Chatham research shows there are additional services that are important to plan sponsors.
Top value-added services
Source: Chatham Partners, ""Assessing How Plan Sponsors Manage Change within Defined Contribution Plans,"" January 2022. Responses to the question, ""Which aspects of the value-added services provided by the advisor for your defined contribution retirement plan are most important to you?"" Some categories received more than one mention.*
For example, a plan’s goals and objectives can vary for each plan sponsor, so FPs play an important role in helping them identify and prioritize what they are trying to accomplish — and emphasize — with their plan.
By clearly aligning with your client’s objectives for the plan, you can demonstrate to sponsors how you tie all the services you offer back to their goals. This can help clients better understand the value you provide and ensure you are achieving the best results.
Leverage evolving retirement legislation
Congress currently has several bills in motion, and states across the country have begun considering or already enacted their own state-sponsored retirement program mandates. Employers report a need to stay on top of what’s happening on both the federal and state levels, and to understand how their plans or responsibilities may be affected.
Plan sponsors rely on third parties to provide information on potential legislative and regulatory changes
Source: Chatham Partners, ""Assessing How Plan Sponsors Manage Change within Defined Contribution Plans,"" January 2022. Responses to the question, ""How are potential legislative and regulatory changes factored into your approach for evaluating and implementing changes for your organization's defined contribution retirement plan?""*
One plan sponsor noted that “[Our advisor] was hired to track and stay on top of legislative and regulatory changes that affect our organization’s defined contribution retirement plan to keep the plan in compliance.” The majority of plan sponsors (two-thirds) say they rely on outside providers to bring potential legislative and regulatory changes to their attention, and three-quarters say they delegate such updates to their financial professionals.
Help the plan sponsor define priorities
The study found some of plan sponsors’ top priorities include:
Increasing employee participation and contribution rates
Reviewing investment options
Participant support and education
Participant support and education through their FP seems to be particularly important to sponsors of plans with less than $75 million in assets, as it was cited as the most important service their financial professional could provide. Interestingly, participant education was one of the few areas of advisor support where plan sponsors would like to see improvement.
One respondent noted that employee education has mostly been handled by their plan provider, but they would like their financial professional to be more involved and proactively reach out to participants. With this in mind, and if your business model allows, you might want to consider personalizing your participant education outreach efforts, targeted to each client’s participant demographic.
Understand plan needs to help drive better participant outcomes
Competing in today’s retirement plan marketplace poses increasing challenges. But given the increasing importance of participant experiences and outcomes, financial professionals who focus on these areas may help drive plan sponsor satisfaction and loyalty.
By uncovering the needs of plan sponsors and their participants and demonstrating the breadth of services you offer, you may be able to set yourself apart. And you don’t need to be a mind reader to know that.

A new white paper by Groom Law Group (commissioned by Capital Group and available below) may provide some guidance on how to act in the best interest of the plan’s participants, given the backdrop of recent regulatory guidance and court decisions.
Specifically, the paper concludes there is more flexibility for fiduciaries among investment options than some high-visibility lawsuits suggest, provided that the fiduciaries act prudently in selecting and monitoring investment funds. When ERISA principles, U.S. Department of Labor authorities and court decisions are considered, the paper concludes, active as well as passive strategies can serve an important role in a 401(k) plan.
Highlights include:
The active vs. passive debate
ERISA makes no distinction between active and passive investments when it comes to the selection and monitoring process.
Neither the DOL nor the courts have stated that active strategies are inappropriate for 401(k) plans.
Investment selection
Neither ERISA nor the DOL mandate any type of investment as necessarily prudent or imprudent.
Investment results
Whether plan fiduciaries acted prudently in making an investment decision cannot be measured in hindsight based on how the investment performed.
Plan fees
The relevant facts and circumstances concerning investment-related fees include the expected return that could be achieved for the fees paid.
Recent court decisions
Several courts have rejected plaintiffs’ attempt to compare active to passive strategies, ruling that active offers different objectives, risks and potential results than passive.

A record number of American workers left their jobs in 2021 in what has been called the “Great Resignation.”
Plan sponsors may be overlooking the value of their retirement plans as a tool to attract and retain talent.
In a tight job market, adding or enhancing a retirement plan may help plan sponsors compete in the race for talent.
The “Big Quit.” The “Great Resignation.” The “Great Reshuffle.” Whatever you call it, American workers are walking away from their jobs in record numbers. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, roughly 47 million Americans quit their jobs in 2021, and the trend isn’t slowing down.
One of the top ways companies attract and retain talent is by increasing wages. But in a tight labor market, a decent salary might not be enough. There is, however, one recruitment and retention tool that employers might be overlooking — the 401(k) plan or other retirement plans offered by the employer.
According to data from MetLife and the latest U.S. Chamber of Commerce Small Business Index, the labor shortage may be especially painful to small-business owners as almost half (46%) indicate they are facing a worker shortage. As a retirement plan specialist, you can be an ally to your small-business clients in the race for talent by talking to them about how adding or enhancing a retirement plan may help them better compete.
Ask plan sponsors why they have a plan
Make sure you are aligned with their objectives. Many plan sponsors may not focus on why they have originally offered a plan or its objective. They may consider a retirement plan as table stakes — a must-have to simply get in the game. But since they have already committed to the plan, make sure they understand and position it as a valued commodity that helps attract and retain workers. Helping plan sponsors see the value of the plan will help you deliver the best retirement solution.
With so many people leaving their jobs, plan sponsors need to up their recruiting game to fill vacancies. Fortunately, they can position their retirement benefits as a valuable recruitment and retention tool. Ask your clients to consider these facts:
With more than half of Americans saying they are concerned about retirement security and their ability to save enough on their own,* 401(k)s are taking on increased importance to employees and candidates.
51% of employees joined their current employer chiefly because it offered a retirement plan, according to a survey from Willis Tower Watson.
Just over half (52%) of employers offer a 401(k) plan, but that number falls to 44% among small employers.†
Explain to your clients that offering a retirement plan shows they care about employees and their well-being and can help them stand out among employers, which can help with current recruitment and retention issues.
A retirement plan can help with employee turnover
A strong retirement plan can also be a way to potentially safeguard against employees being recruited away by other companies. According to an October 2021 survey from the Society for Human Resources Management (SHRM), 41% of currently employed workers are actively searching or planning to search for a new job, and many cited better benefits among the top reasons. Clients should make sure their retirement plan is all it can be and that they are getting the most out of it.
Plan sponsors can get the most “bang for their buck” from their retirement plan by:
Promoting the plan with tailored communications.
Educating employees about how the company is invested in them and their future through the retirement plan.
Making enhancements to the plan to make it even more attractive.
What to do about employee retention and recruitment
Boost the power of the retirement plan with some of these changes that may help attract and retain employees:
Highlight the plan in the recruiting process. Encourage clients to talk up their plan in recruitment materials or during interviews.
Consider expanding eligibility requirements to include part-time employees and/or waive length-of-service requirements for employees to join the plan.
Increase the employer match if financially feasible.
Consider providing student loan assistance. Many younger workers are saddled with student debt, making it difficult for them to contribute to a 401(k) plan. A small monthly contribution toward workers’ student debt may be a recruiting incentive and encourage plan participation.
Auto-features can also help boost a retirement plan’s effectiveness. While many plans already have some in place, there are ways to help plan sponsors make better use of them.
Learn how to make the most of auto-features
Clients need your help
The success of your client’s company is tied directly to the quality of its workforce. With record numbers of people leaving their jobs, now is a great time to talk to clients about reevaluating their retirement plan and using it as a recruitment and retention tool. A strong retirement plan, like a 401(k), is a great way for plan sponsors to show that they value their employees and for you to demonstrate yours.

The more reliant an investor is on their investment portfolio for retirement savings, the more likely market volatility will impact their retirement income.
Our Portfolio Reliance Calculator can estimate how much of their retirement income is protected.
Depending on an individual’s withdrawal rate, higher levels of protected income may correspond with increased investor confidence.
A portfolio withdrawal strategy is essential to retirement planning, but it doesn’t paint the whole picture of retirement for clients. Each investor’s portfolio withdrawal rate may differ from another’s, depending on the size of the portfolio, planning horizon and spending needs, as well as inflation and market returns. But those investors who are too reliant on an investment portfolio for income may be more susceptible to outside risks. Understanding the portfolio reliance rate can help you and your clients plan for these risks and consider whether additional protected income is needed.
How volatility affects withdrawals
The portfolio reliance rate, which is the inverse of the protected income percentage, shows how much an investment portfolio is relied upon for retirement income. As reliance on the investment portfolio for income increases, so does the potential sensitivity to market volatility, sequence of returns risk (e.g., the risk of market declines in the early years of retirement), as well as the longevity of a withdrawal strategy.
Portfolio reliance and withdrawal rates are connected in that if an investor has a more conservative withdrawal rate — for example, 3% or less — then they may be able to rely more heavily on their investment portfolio to meet their retirement income needs. But if an investor has a higher withdrawal rate, then this increased reliance on the investment portfolio may make them more sensitive to market fluctuations, among other risks.
Check out our Portfolio Reliance Calculator
How to tell if an investor relies too much on their investment portfolio
Begin the discussion with a few key questions:
How elastic are their income requirements (i.e., delaying lifestyle wants to meet living needs)?
How flexible can they be with their spending (i.e., spending less, if necessary, during inevitable short-term market declines)?
Are there other options to consider that can increase income from outside sources (i.e., delaying claiming Social Security)?
Can they live with a loss of income?
What determines the withdrawal rate?
The withdrawal rate from a portfolio can help determine how long retirement income may last. The rate is affected not only by the income that is needed to live (including taxes and inflation), but also by the protected income sources a client has such as Social Security, pension income and/or annuities. Various other factors will also affect a withdrawal rate, such as an investor’s retirement planning horizon, inflation and market volatility. The length of retirement is a major factor in determining a withdrawal rate. Clients who plan on shorter retirement lifespans may be able to spend more while those with longer planned retirements may want to be more conservative in their withdrawals.
Fluctuations in the market will also affect how much clients can withdraw. Naturally, lower market returns will support a lower withdrawal rate and could impact the longevity of the portfolio. And a higher withdrawal rate may be supported by some combination of a shorter life expectancy, strong market returns and modest inflation.
Know the risks worth taking and protect from those that aren’t
Retirement risks come in many forms. The process of building a retirement income strategy that instills confidence includes helping clients determine if they want to incorporate or protect from various risks.
Incorporating risk could include, for example, a reduction in the withdrawal rate to plan for a longer time horizon or higher inflation rates, or to provide more flexibility of spending.
The Portfolio Reliance Calculator
Starting with a client’s expected spending needs and outside sources of protected income, financial professionals can use a tool like Capital Group’s Portfolio Reliance Calculator to provide a point-in-time estimate of the amount needed to withdraw from a retirement income investment portfolio.
Seeking a balance of retirement income sources — protected and investment income — may help to provide stability and reliability for a retirement income strategy. By helping investors understand how reliant they are on the investment portfolio to meet their retirement income needs, as well as the options available to reduce this reliance, you can prepare them to better withstand inevitable market downturns among other risks.
The value of reducing withdrawal stress
While additional protected income may not be needed for some clients, sources of protected lifetime income, such as Social Security, pensions and annuities, can be important tools for retirement spending and may be used to cover essential expenses that are fixed and not flexible. By helping to reduce some of the withdrawal stress placed on the investment portfolio, these sources could also help reduce the risk of outliving assets due to some combination of a long life and/or poor market returns. For many retirees, the confidence that comes from knowing they have a stable income stream no matter how long they live is of utmost importance.
Why might clients need higher levels of protected income?
Managing longevity risk with insurance can be an alternative to asking retirees to spend more conservatively to account for living longer or dealing with rising health care costs, and it can help protect against the impact that a poor sequence of market returns early in retirement can have on a strategy. Even in cases where longevity risk is not a concern, exploring opportunities to increase their level of protected income may help improve their overall confidence in retirement.
There is no way to be certain what the future will hold, but higher levels of protected income can help instill confidence that clients are prepared for what’s ahead. Depending on an investor’s unique situation, they may look to increase their outside protected lifetime income to provide more predictable income, regardless of market performance or longevity, and reduce the reliance on investment income.

349,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/ir-target-date-inflation.html,Is your target date fund prepared for inflation?,Target Date,"February 15, 2022","Inflation seems to be on everyone’s minds these days. From groceries to home prices, the recent spike in inflation touches nearly every aspect of life. According to U.S. Department of Labor data, the consumer price index climbed 7% in 2021, the largest 12-month gain since June 1982.
Inflation has remained in check for the past 40 years
Source: Bloomberg. Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers: All items in U.S. city average, year over year, not seasonally adjusted, as of December 31, 2021.
As earlier generations of retirees can attest, higher inflation may, over time, erode the purchasing power of retirement savings. Sustained levels of high inflation may prevent retirement income from keeping up with price increases in goods and services.
With that in mind, you and your plan sponsor clients may want to review their plan’s investment options — especially their target date fund (TDF) — to understand how they seek to manage inflation risks for participants.
Younger participants: Growth strategies to outpace the cost of living
Equities have long been considered a traditional inflation hedge over the long term. Thus, the growth-oriented component of the target date glide path may be particularly important to younger participants who want to accumulate wealth and may have more time to recover from any potential market losses.
When it comes to inflation, however, not all equities are created equal. Target date managers may or may not have the flexibility to invest in underlying funds that invest in equities that are typically more resilient to inflation, such as:
Dividend-paying stocks, whose earnings and income may rise along with prices for goods and services
Value stocks, especially in inflation-resistant industries like manufacturing and materials
Financial and utilities stocks, which may benefit from higher interest rates and prices charged for essential services
Specialty sectors like real estate investment trusts (REITs), precious metals and commodities
In inflationary environments like this, Capital Group looks for companies with pricing power, those with the flexibility to raise their prices because of strong brands or because they provide essential services. As consumer prices continue to rise, we seek to uncover companies that can sustain pricing power as it may prove to be a competitive advantage during inflationary periods.
Older participants: Income strategies to preserve purchasing power
Retirees and those close to retirement could look to TDFs to help protect against volatility while providing income that keeps up with rising prices. This puts the emphasis on the fixed income portion of the glide path.
One increasingly popular fixed income inflation protection strategy is the use of U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), which adjust their income levels based on inflationary expectations. When large, unexpected pricing shocks cause inflation to exceed those expectations, TIPS can also provide capital appreciation opportunities.
As target date solutions committee member Wesley Phoa recently pointed out: “If the U.S. is indeed entering an environment of high and volatile inflation, our research suggests TIPS can provide a useful inflation hedge.”
TIPS may not be a standard inflationary hedge in core bond funds because they are not included in the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index benchmark. The American Funds Target Date Retirement Series® does tactically utilize underlying fixed income strategies that hold TIPS as a potential buffer against inflationary shocks.
Interest rate hikes are the typical policy response to inflation, which can stress many fixed income securities, especially higher-yielding ones. TDFs utilizing fixed income strategies that maintain a disciplined approach to the four roles of fixed income that don’t chase the yield curve in pursuit of higher income may be better positioned against inflation risks in a dynamic macroeconomic environment like the one we are in now.
At Capital Group, our TDF series is not as dependent on fixed income because of the inclusion of dividend-paying stocks. Still, inflation is a big concern, as fixed income portfolio manager Pramod Atluri explains: “We are laser focused on inflation because that’s the biggest risk to investors’ portfolios over the near term. If we are wrong about inflation, we will be wrong on the upside, so it makes sense to protect against that outcome.”
Inflation and the glide path
Managing inflation within a glide path can be challenging. You want to ensure there is enough equity for younger participants to build wealth and an appropriate fixed income allocation for older participants that need capital preservation.
To support this overall goal of building and preserving wealth, Capital Group takes a “glide path within a glide path” approach whereby equity and bond holdings evolve in both amount and type over time. In addition to this, we allow for a degree of asset class flexibility within both our underlying equity and bond strategies to help manage investment risks, like inflation, so the series can quickly adapt to address market conditions.
The bottom line for plan sponsor clients
The investment community is still discussing whether this latest bout of inflation is “transient” or “sticky,” but you may not have the luxury to wait for their conclusions. Your clients need to know how their investments are positioned for inflation, and that provides an opportunity to show your value when it is most needed.

Target Date
Inflation
Although the target date portfolios are managed for investors on a projected retirement date time frame, the allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' retirement goals will be met. Investment professionals manage the portfolio, moving it from a more growth-oriented strategy to a more income-oriented focus as the target date gets closer. The target date is the year that corresponds roughly to the year in which an investor is assumed to retire and begin taking withdrawals. Investment professionals continue to manage each portfolio for approximately 30 years after it reaches its target date.

But they don’t have to be an overly onerous task to check off your New Year’s to-do list.
Instead, use a combination of art and science to showcase the value you bring throughout the year. One common pitfall financial professionals often make is to focus the review on the science — plan costs and the funds by the numbers. Anyone can plug numbers into a computer and obtain an output. In many ways you, as the financial professional, bring the “art” by tying the numbers to your clients’ human needs.
Prepare for the meeting by looking through the eyes of the plan sponsor
Successful plan reviews start with thinking about a client’s point of view and the plan’s objectives. That enables you to personalize the review process, so the client feels any challenges have been understood and addressed.
As you plan for the unique challenge of 2022 plan reviews, here are some questions to ask:
Has your client’s business grown during the pandemic or is it still struggling to get back on track? Thriving businesses may be eager to “bounce forward” and put more attention on retirement plan outcomes as an employee-retention strategy.
Have older employees retired and been replaced with younger ones in “the year of the great resignation”? If so, consider adding more automatic features to the plan.
How would your client prefer to meet, in person or virtually? With the success of virtual work over the past few years, don't assume that they want to go back to meeting in person.
Use plan design to demonstrate your value
The answers to the questions above may help inform how you address plan needs by using the levers of thoughtful plan design.
Here are several plan design best practices you should consider discussing with your client if they are not already in place.
Auto enrollment. Start new eligible employees — and maybe some long-standing employees — saving as early as possible.
Auto escalation. If your clients are auto-enrolling, they should also consider auto-escalating, which systematically raises the default rate over time. This is a great way to address undersaving in retirement plans since the contribution comes before the paycheck and may provide participants often-needed discipline.
Investment re-enrollment. The more than a decade-long equity bull market has benefitted many participants’ retirement balances. But there may be participants who missed out by not being invested in appropriate investments. An investment re-enrollment, where all participants are swept into a default investment (usually an age-appropriate target date fund) unless they opt out, is a great tool to do just that.
Address the three types of retirement plan investors
Your clients’ employees are not all the same, and neither are their investing styles. That’s why the core investment menu should be evaluated from the standpoint of how it serves the needs of what I consider the three different types of retirement plan investors:
The most common of the three investors is, of course, the “do-it-for-me” variety. That’s a big reason why the selection of a QDIA is arguably the most important investment decision a plan sponsor makes. The ease and simplicity of target date funds (TDFs) makes them good potential solutions for the “do-it-for-me” investors. But the diverse nature of TDFs makes them difficult to compare across different managers’ series. There are tools that can help, such as Target Date ProView℠, which uses Morningstar data to objectively compare series.
About those costs
You don’t want to make the conversation all about costs, but you can focus on areas where you can add value. One example might be some education about the relationship between investment management and recordkeeping costs.
Isolating recordkeeping costs can help reveal hidden expenses that could cost your clients more than they expect. Solutions that provide transparent or upfront pricing can help them understand exactly what they’re paying and what services they’re getting. Emphasize to clients how all types of costs are not created equal.
Decoupling investment management and recordkeeping costs
Hypothetical chart for illustration purposes only. Example shows total cost using R-6 shares, which do not charge sales fees.
The above hypothetical scenario considers the total recordkeeping costs of two plans. The total costs of the plans are the same — 100 basis points. But looking at the total number alone doesn’t tell the full story. Plan sponsors should also look at the components of that cost to analyze how it relates to value.
In the example, costs are divided into three types: recordkeeping services, fund expenses and financial professional compensation, with the compensation being equal in both examples.
Plan A charges four times as much for recordkeeping services.
In contrast, Plan B charges four times as much for fund costs.
While plan sponsors may initially have concerns over the level of fund costs in Plan B, choosing the cheapest fund isn’t necessarily best, nor is a plan obligated to do so to meet its fiduciary duty. The example highlights the importance of looking at each component of plan costs, not just the total.
Here are some cost-related questions you might ask:
Has the plan undergone any changes such as asset growth or sponsor goals?
Can any costs be lowered or negotiated?
Would a different plan solution or cost structure make sense?
Would the plan benefit from a share class change?
And what services could the sponsor add that might improve the “health” of the plan?
Strategic resources
There is a lot to cover during annual plan reviews, but we offer the following resources that may make the process as efficient and effective as possible:

352,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/ir-state-sponsored-plans.html,The current state of state-sponsored retirement plans,Plan Design,"December 28, 2021","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
14 states have created state-sponsored plans, 10 of them mandatory
Conventional retirement plan solutions may work better than some state programs
Financial professionals can help employers decide the best option
American workers rely on their employers’ plans for most of their retirement savings. But among businesses with fewer than 100 employees, only 41% of employees participate in retirement plans.* To reduce this retirement coverage gap, nearly every state has either begun considering or actually implemented some version of a state-sponsored retirement program.
16 programs and counting
As of October 31, 2021, 14 states and two cities have enacted programs. Some are already active; some will take effect at a future date. Every state program is unique, but many share common features: 
Investments through Roth IRA accounts
Automatic payroll deduction, usually voluntary
Investment firms chosen by the state
Is your state plan mandatory or voluntary?
Ten state plans, such as those in California and my home state of Illinois, are considered mandatory plans. That is, employers with a certain number of employees must make available a state-run auto-IRA plan if they offer no other plan. These plans typically also require a minimum salary deduction, unless the employee opts out, as well as various financial penalties for non-compliance.
Other states, like New Mexico and Washington, use a voluntary model, where employers can shop for a payroll-deduction-only plan — typically with some tax incentives — by using a state-approved menu of IRA and 401(k) providers. 
46 states have programs now or are considering them
State-by-state status is compiled from Georgetown University’s Center for Retirement Initiatives as of December 13, 2021.
For more detail about your state’s plan and its current legislative status, go to cri.georgetown.edu/states/.
First out of the gate: The Prairie State 
To get a feel for the logistics of a state program, let’s look at the example of my state of Illinois’ Secure Choice Program, which was the first state plan to be signed into law. This program requires employers to automatically enroll their employees into the program or select a qualified plan in the private market if the business:
Has at least 25 employees,
Has been domiciled in Illinois for two or more years, or
Does not currently provide an employee savings plan like a 401(k), SIMPLE or SEP plan.
Employees in Secure Choice begin saving at a default rate of 5% of pay — unless they opt out. For the first 90 days after the initial contribution, funds are held in a money market fund and then defaulted into a target date fund. Non-compliance results in a penalty of $250 per employee the first year the employee is unenrolled and $500 per employee for the second year and beyond. 
State officials oversee investments
One of the more concerning aspects of state-sponsored plans is investment oversight. In Illinois, for example, investments are chosen by a board of seven: the state Treasurer, State Comptroller, the director from the management and budget office of the governor and four additional representatives appointed by the governor. These seven individuals are in essence responsible for the retirement savings of thousands of Illinois businesses. 
Typically, sponsors customize their retirement plans depending on their participants’ needs. In a state-sponsored plan, that nuance is lost.
CalSavers is up and running 
Another example of a mandatory plan is California’s CalSavers program, which, like Illinois Secure Choice, requires employers without a retirement plan to join a state-run plan where investments are run by a state board. The deadline to register for employers with more than 50 employees has passed, while employers with five or more employees have until June 30, 2022, to do so.
Unless they select their own rate, employees begin saving at a default rate of 5% of pay, with auto-escalation of 1% per year to be capped at 8% of salary.
Alternatives to state-sponsored retirement plans
Given the restrictions and complexity of many state plans, some business owners may want to take a more active role by considering traditional retirement plan alternatives. Many traditional retirement plans were designed specifically to create a comfortable retirement for employees at a low cost with a minimum amount of employer involvement.
A couple of factors may encourage small employers to take a close look at sponsoring their own retirement plan. First, employers starting their first-ever retirement plan may qualify for a federal tax credit up to $5,000 a year to defray startup costs. The credit can be used for up to three years after the plan’s launch. Second, plan costs have been steadily declining for more than a decade. 
Depending on the state program, the following arrangements might be preferable:
Simplified employee pension individual retirement account (SEP IRA): With a SEP IRA, only the employer contributes to participant accounts. Contributions are capped at 25% of a participant’s compensation or the annually adjusted IRS limit, whichever is less. Annual filings or disclosures are not required.
Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees Individual Retirement Account (SIMPLE IRA): SIMPLE IRAs are available to employers with 100 or fewer employees. Employers are required to make contributions for all eligible employees, either a dollar-for-dollar match of up to 3% of pay or a 2% non-elective contribution. Contributions are subject to IRS limits, which are determined annually. Sponsors are required to provide annual notices to all eligible employees.
401(k) plans: Traditional 401(k) plans are available for all private-sector employers, regardless of size. These plans allow for both participant and employer contributions, with annual maximums much higher than IRA maximums. Employers have significant flexibility when they sponsor their own plan. Sponsors are required to provide certain disclosures to their employees. Employers do accept fiduciary liability; however, some aspects of fiduciary liability can be outsourced to specialized service firms.
Small businesses need your help
Because many small employers may have never considered implementing retirement plans prior to the introduction of new state programs, the opportunity to educate and assist these business owners is vast. While many may not be eager to take on this new responsibility, retirement plan professionals have the tools and resources to help make the experience better.
Some questions to ask about the arrangements in your state include: 
Does it include part-time employees?
Is there investment flexibility beyond the prescribed investments of state boards?
Is there a provision to stop contributing once one has hit the Roth IRA income limits?
The devil is in the details, which is why the best alternative to state-sponsored plans may be an investment professional. With the advent of state-sponsored plans, you, the licensed financial professional, can help an employer comply with state mandates or create a customized retirement program consistent with the needs of the business and its employees. By guiding employers through the alternatives, you may be able to help them create the best plan for their business.

With the lack of universal coverage affecting millions of Americans, there have been numerous federal government attempts to increase access to workplace savings arrangements. The latest trend is to compel employers to offer a retirement plan to their workers.
Efforts to make employers improve coverage
The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act was the first substantial law passed in years to address the coverage gap. SECURE 1.0 included a significant expansion of the startup plan tax credit and cleared the way for pooled employer plans (PEPs), in the hope that they would turn out to be attractive to small-business employers.
Another proposed retirement law, dubbed the SECURE Act 2.0, was introduced in late 2020 and is currently making its way through Congress. It would expand on the approach taken in SECURE 1.0 with a further expansion of the startup plan tax credit as well as changes to reduce plan administrative costs.
Earlier this year, the House Ways and Means Committee cleared the Build Back Better Act (BBBA): a proposal that would require U.S. companies without retirement plans to automatically enroll workers in IRAs. However, due to competing priorities, that provision has been dropped from the most recent version of the bill. Still, strong support for such a measure suggests the trend toward universal retirement plans will continue.
States stepping up to close the coverage gap
While waiting for Congress to act, several states have taken the lead and have started IRA-type programs that require employers without retirement plans to offer one for their workers.
More than a dozen states have enacted programs, and many more states are considering or implementing them. Programs in California, Illinois and Oregon are up and running, with Maryland next to begin implementing its automatic workplace retirement program, starting in summer 2022.
Most recently, New York changed its Secure Choice Savings program from the voluntary (not-yet implemented) version passed in 2018 to a mandatory program. The timeline for New York’s program to get underway is still to be decided but is similar to the Maryland program: Employers with at least 10 employees will be required to offer a traditional retirement plan for their employees or use New York’s new Secure Choice plan, an automatic enrollment payroll deduction IRA retirement savings program.
These state mandates are a great opportunity to start a conversation with your small-business clients. Some state plans are complex, have restrictions and may provide little choice when it comes to investment options. As a result of these concerns, some of your clients may want to take a more active role by considering a traditional retirement plan.
For the financial professional who wishes to stand out, there is an opportunity to start a dialogue with clients and understand any specific pain points or concerns they may have with a state-run plan. Some alternatives to state-run plans include Simplified Employee Pension IRAs (SEP IRA), Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees IRAs (SIMPLE IRA or Simple IRA Plus) or traditional 401(k) plans. These alternatives can provide greater customization and the ability to select quality investments that may drive better participant outcomes.

Universal retirement plans are the norm overseas
Saving for retirement is not unique to American workers. Governments around the world also worry about their citizens’ retirement security. In fact, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), more than 30 OECD and non-OECD reporting jurisdictions have pension plans requiring mandatory or quasi-mandatory participation.

Several countries, like Australia, New Zealand and the U.K., have enacted compulsory programs requiring both employers and employees to contribute to a retirement savings plan. Employees are automatically enrolled upon employment but have the opportunity to opt out. New Zealand’s KiwiSaver program has gained significant scale since it launched in 2007, growing from 15,000 participants to over 3 million participants at the end of 2020, according to the 2020 KiwiSaver Annual Report. Considering New Zealand’s population of approximately 5 million people, it’s safe to say that the majority of working New Zealanders participate in the program.

The trend worldwide is universal coverage in retirement plans. I believe we’ll get there eventually, but in our uniquely American way.

How you can make the trend your clients’ friend
Expanded access to workplace retirement plans is needed in the United States and has already taken hold in other countries around the world. It has support from U.S. policymakers, although it may take some time to come to fruition. Universal access is the wave of the future. Financial professionals who prepare in advance of any legislation will be in a better position to help their clients adapt. Consider how potential changes may affect your clients, start conversations with them about their needs and wants and discuss alternatives that may give them more control over their specific plan. That way you can show your value while helping your clients’ employees prepare for a comfortable retirement.

Capital Group’s research finds they are adapting their financial philosophies in response to their pandemic experiences and are looking to take control of their financial futures.
With many women now prioritizing financial security and resiliency, there is a unique opportunity for you to engage with them. Indeed, Capital Group’s April 2021 Wisdom of Experience investor survey of approximately 2,000 American women and 500 men found that 35% of millennial women and 25% of all women are looking to rely more on a financial professional in the future.
Source: Capital Group, Women's financial futures: New financial philosophies taking shape post COVID-19, April 2021.
Empowering women
To make the most of the opportunity, financial professionals interested in reaching women need to understand their unique mindsets. As they relate to investors overall, women are more likely than men to:
Feel concerned about their personal finances
Express that their finances incite anxiety and affect their physical well-being
Use less aggressive investment approaches
To engage these women, you have to understand who they are, and where and how they seek advice.
Changing behaviors
Women have been most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the early phase of the pandemic, women have been more likely than men to lose or leave their jobs — and to remain out of work, many months later. As a result, women’s behaviors toward money have changed.
Our survey found that 28% of women say they reduced or stopped contributions to employer-sponsored retirement plans during the pandemic. And an equal number expect to delay their retirement. But on the positive side, 43% of women say they now place more importance than before on saving for retirement, and one-third (32%) say they are spending more time thinking about their finances.
This increased interest is especially good news for women, many of whom may have felt underprepared or not empowered to manage their financial futures.
Breaking the silence
Traditionally, women may have avoided talking about finances because they may find it too personal, uncomfortable, or because they lack confidence on the subject.
Now, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many women say their attitudes toward finances are changing. That includes being more open about their financial situations and sharing their experiences, especially among networks of family and friends. More than half of women in our survey (51%) discovered that when they communicate with other women about their personal finances, they find that others are going through similar situations. This is motivating them not only to gather new knowledge but also to share it openly.
Making the connection
As women become more open about their finances, it’s useful to explore how and where they gather their information. Our survey found that where women turn for financial advice differed greatly depending on age, wealth, race and other factors. Some women are system connected, meaning they more often turn to financial professionals, financial advice at work and other traditional financial resources. Still other groups of women tend to be more socially connected and more likely to turn to established social networks among family and friends as well as on social media and other online or public sources of financial information.
System or socially connected: women's sources for financial advice vary greatly
Source: Capital Group, Women's financial futures: New financial philosophies taking shape post COVID-19, April 2021.
How to meet women where they are
White women and baby boomers tend to be more system connected, with 37% of white women and 48% of baby boomers indicating they consider financial professionals to be the most helpful source of information. The survey also shows being system connected correlates with increased financial stability. Affluent women, defined as any woman with between $500,000 and at least $2 million in assets, tend to be system connected and are likely to have a wider range of financial accounts and better access to financial professionals, employers and federal programs.
On the other hand, women of color and millennials tend to be more socially connected and seek advice online. Women in these groups seem to be in need of help, as many report feeling nervous and anxious about their finances. This presents an opportunity for financial professionals to engage with these underserved groups.
For women who seek information online, consider building out your social media presence:
Emphasize that while discussing finances may feel new and uncomfortable for them, it doesn’t for you — you’ve been helping clients achieve their financial goals for a number of years.
Ensure there is current information on financial topics available on your site. Many women use social media to find the answer to something specific, such as tax tables and credits, 401(k) deferral limits and emergency savings tips, to name a few.
Promote a “monthly success story” that discusses a way you and/or a team member helped a client achieve a financial goal — both big (purchasing a home) and small (getting a 529 account started for their children). Be aware, however, that there are strict regulatory requirements related to marketing client experiences and testimonials; confer with your compliance department before promoting ""success stories.""
Have a series of short (60-90 seconds) videos available explaining financial topics — either done by you, a resource your firm promotes or reposting other credible content.
Winning with women: keys to engagement
This newfound openness surrounding financial topics gives financial professionals the opportunity to better engage with women. But to have a more meaningful dialogue, financial professionals should consider not just what information is communicated to women, but also how it is communicated.
To help win women clients now:
Offer education. Build programs and tailor communications to reach women who are currently more socially connected than system connected. Some financial professionals use content marketing to not only provide essential education to investors but to also improve their brand visibility and position in search engines. Creating educational content that speaks to this market could be a valuable way to build your brand.
Connect with your clients on social media. Sharing content on social media, in line with your firm's legal and compliance policies, to reach women directly is a natural first step, but also consider broader audiences. Compelling content could be picked up by an influencer, media outlet or even the website of another business.
Leverage your retirement expertise. Women are now placing more importance than before on saving for retirement, which provides an opportunity for you to showcase your knowledge and engage a new set of clients. In addition, many women own businesses and may be looking to start or change an employer-sponsored retirement plan.
Make diversity, equity and inclusion part of your practice. According to the Center for Financial Planning Board’s 2020 report, Diversity in Action: How to Sustain the Financial Planning Profession, racial and gender diversity are crucial to the sustainability of the financial planning profession. If you are adding staff to your practice, keep in mind countless studies have found that diversity can lead to stronger teams, greater perspective and increased innovation. Additional voices in the profession could help to organically open up those systems and social connections to reach a wider array of prospective clients. One firm's incorporation of gender diversity into its practice has resulted in low employee turnover and high client satisfaction.

359,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/ir-teen-retirement-planning.html,Retirement planning for the next generation,Practice Management,"August 31, 2021","Born into the age of smartphones, tablets and virtual reality, today’s teens are the most technologically savvy generation thus far. But when it comes to finances, most of them are barely getting a passing grade. That makes some sense, since only six states mandate a stand-alone financial literacy course as a required part of their core high school curriculum.1
But they know the importance of financial literacy and want to learn.
A recent survey found that the majority (73%) of teens want financial education, and a whopping 86% of respondents are interested in investing.2  Still, many haven't started because they (and their parents) lack the knowledge or confidence to do so.
That’s where you can make a difference. As a workplace professional and through the employers and participants you serve, there is an opportunity to prepare the next generation for financial independence and break the cycle of low financial literacy.
Financial independence versus retirement
Teenagers may not care about something so far in the future as retirement. But what if you reframed the conversation toward becoming financially independent? To be sure, many people equate financial freedom with the ability to stop working. But it can mean so much more, such as:
Starting a business — Many teens may reject the notion of working a decades-long, 9-to-5 job. Financial resources could give them the freedom to start a business they care about and be their own boss.
Following a passion — Let’s face it, most teens will have to work at some point in their lives. But being financially independent could mean having the ability to find a job that they feel passionate about rather than one that simply pays the bills.
Furthering their education — We’ve all heard the stories of the mounting student debt facing today’s teens and young adults. The ability to attend college or otherwise advance their education without debt can put them ahead of the game and free up resources to finance other goals.
Giving back — Having grown up with social media, many of today’s teens are socially aware and are interested in making a difference. Financial independence could mean helping family, their communities and people in need. With the advent of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, they can target their investments toward those that do good and avoid those that do harm.
Enjoying life — Today’s teens have a reputation for being more frugal than previous generations, but they still want to enjoy their lives. Having financial resources could give them the ability to travel, buy a boat or splurge on other big-ticket items.
The concept of saving may sound boring to teenagers and young adults but reframing it as a pathway to achieving financial freedom to do what they want may resonate better with a younger audience and pique their interest.
Measuring wealth in seconds, not dollars
While few teenagers may have a million dollars in the bank, they are exponentially richer in something else: time. Consider this: A 14-year-old with a life expectancy of 100 years essentially “owns” more than 2.7 billion seconds, while the average 44-year-old with a life expectancy of 100 years has approximately 1.7 billion seconds (See Figure 1). The 14-year-old has the 44-year-old beat by one billion seconds. With the raw material of time, teenagers are already multi-billionaires. Think about how those extra seconds can translate to dollars thanks to compound interest.
Figure 1. Today's teens are time billionaires

Emphasize the value of time over the value of money
Financial professionals understand the concept of compound interest, but most teenagers don’t know what it is and what a powerful tool it can be for reaching their financial goals. Emphasize that the earlier they start saving and investing, the more time their savings will have the potential to grow. And maybe just as important, how little they need to get started.
To a typical teenager, $100 may seem like a windfall that could be spent on the latest tech device or trendy sneakers. But, with a little patience, that $100 could turn into so much more. Consider the hypothetical example of a custodial account opened for a 14-year-old with $100 invested monthly over 50 years. Assuming an 8% rate of return, that account could reach over $800,000 by the time she reaches age 65.3  The 44-year old who follows the same investing parameters but only invests for 21 years would only have $66,000!4
If the thought of living to age 100 sounds far-fetched, think again. Americans are living longer than ever, and the 14-year-old in the example could even reach 103 years!5  As life expectancy continues to increase, so will the amount of money people will need in retirement. That’s why it’s so important to encourage teenagers to get those “billions"" working as soon as possible.

Helping teenagers put their billions to work
Teaching teens to save is a valuable first step, but the path to their financial independence may be to invest their savings. When explaining the high-level concept of investing to kids, keep these three things in mind:
Start with the basics — Help them understand investing terminology and break down complicated words and topics into simpler terms. Familiarize them with the concept of asset allocation (stocks, bonds and mutual funds) and why what they invest in matters.
Discuss their time horizons — Encourage teens to think about when, where and how they will need to convert their “time’’ into money. They may have multiple time horizons.
Advocate continuous learning — Social media and the internet are great places to start as most major financial institutions have content on their own sites and LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook. There are also numerous nonprofits dedicated to advancing financial literacy for all Americans, not just teens.

Mutual funds: A great introduction to investing
Teens younger than 18 will need to have a parent or guardian set up a custodial account and make transactions on their behalf. But here are some tips to deliver the message that mutual funds might be the way to for them to start their investment journey:
Simplicity: It’s easy to buy and sell mutual funds. And many mutual fund companies “have an app for that,” which may make it easier for parents or guardians of today’s teens to make transactions.
Diversification: The term may make a teen’s eyes glaze over, but not if the importance of variety in buying decisions is pitched to products and preferences they can relate to.
Professional oversight: Explain to them how mutual funds provide them with essentially their own personal portfolio manager whose job is to seek the most attractive investments in support of the fund’s objectives.
Time: Teens are busy. Point out to them that with mutual funds, a professional manager monitors the fund, so they don’t have to spend their own time looking at stock websites and other news to make their own investment decisions. They can even ask their parent or guardian to set up automatic investing, which is great for young investors trying to establish a pattern of consistent investing.

360,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/ir-fixed-income-target-date.html,Why bonds are key to target date fund success,Target Date,"July 27, 2021","When it comes to target date funds, it seems like the equity allocation gets all the attention. Certainly, there are good reasons for this: Equity is responsible for the bulk of the capital appreciation that determines retirement sufficiency.
But in the critical transition and retirement phases, fixed income plays several essential roles that make target date funds such a powerful tool for retirement savings. Fixed income allows target date funds to adjust to varying risks as participants age. As a result, it’s important that financial professionals examine a series’ approach to fixed income and understand how it interacts with equity across the glide path.
The four roles of fixed income
The financial risks relevant to an investor change as they age. Early in their careers, they may fail to accumulate enough to reach their retirement goals; as they approach retirement, a bear market may inflict losses with insufficient time to recover. A diversified bond portfolio can help address these risks thanks to the way bonds interact with equities. Bonds should play different roles within a target date series at each stage of the glide path.
Diversification from equity: Early in the glide path, a modest allocation to conservative bonds with low or negative correlation to stocks can help dampen market risk from equities, which make up the bulk of target date assets at the start of a participant’s career.
Income: As participants approach retirement, they are more sensitive to market risk and need to generate income. They need bonds that can generate strong total returns and good yield with modest risk.
Inflation protection: Inflation-linked bonds can protect purchasing power as the overall equity allocation (a source of long-term inflation protection) steadily declines through the typical glide path.
Capital preservation: In retirement, high-quality, low-duration bonds can partially insulate participants from market and interest rate risk — which can ultimately help improve participant outcomes.
The roles of fixed income in a glide path
Source: American Funds Target Date Retirement Series ®, Capital Group. The target allocations shown are as of April 30, 2021 and are subject to the oversight committee's discretion. The investment adviser anticipates assets will be invested within a range that deviates no more than 10% above or below these allocations. Underlying funds may be added or removed during the year. Changes in the equity allocation within the underlying equity-income and balanced funds may affect the overall equity exposure in the target date portfolios. Visit capitalgroup.com for current allocations
There are three main issues financial professionals should consider when evaluating a series’ approach to fixed income: Whether the strategies are passively or actively managed, the composition of sub-asset classes held and the ability to use bottom-up manager flexibility to help control various risks.
The pros and cons of active vs. passive
It’s no secret that smart people throughout the industry have very different opinions when it comes to using passively managed vs. actively managed bond funds within a target date series. Both can be appropriate, depending on the goals of the overall strategy. However, there are several issues to consider.
Let’s start with passive. Although passively managed funds generally have lower costs, there are issues with implementation. First, market capitalization-based bond indexes are tilted, by definition, to issuers with greater borrowing needs, which may not represent the best opportunities. Bond indexes can be expensive or very difficult to replicate (due to liquidity issues and transitions in/out of the index). Benchmark selection can greatly influence results. And also note that the risk profile of a benchmark can drift over time, as its duration and credit quality track the decisions of the borrowers represented in it.
Active funds tend to have higher management fees. Moreover, the investment manager may not have incentives that are aligned with the objectives of end investors. For example, an underlying bond fund manager may be incentivized to outpace its peer group, and thus to favor taking credit risk even though this means tolerating large drawdowns in equity bear markets. That objective does not necessarily make the fund an optimal building block in a broader allocation strategy like a target date fund, which relies partly on bonds to cushion equity-market shocks.
Yet given the right incentives, actively managed bond funds have additional tools to help manage risk — they are not obliged to take on the risks of specific credits just because they are included in an index, nor to mechanically track any escalation in the aggregate risk of the index. Moreover, they can seek to exploit mispricing opportunities.
What’s inside the bond allocation
Let’s now turn to a consideration of two unique sub-classes within the fixed income market — inflation-linked and high-yield bonds — within the context of a target date series.
Inflation-linked bonds are designed to provide protection against inflation shocks. This characteristic is particularly important for participants in the transition and early retirement years of the glide path, where the risks of a loss of purchasing power are particularly acute as equity exposure is reduced.
The Target Date Solutions Committee, which oversees American Funds Target Date Retirement Series, has modeled the situations in which TIPS would be useful in a target date strategy. Their benefit is that they respond in a very predictable and mechanical way to higher inflation: The principal of the bond increases in line with the U.S. Consumer Price Index, resulting in higher coupon payments and a higher principal repayment at maturity. In addition, the repayment at maturity is guaranteed not to be lower than the original principal.
However, investors pay an insurance-like “premium” for this predictability: lower expected returns. Indeed, in recent years, real yields on TIPS have been negative. Moreover, TIPS returns still have a return component in common with nominal bonds: Both TIPS and nominal bond returns are affected by changes in real yields. So, it is important to use TIPS thoughtfully, in conjunction with other tools.
Regarding the use of high-yield bonds in a target date glide path, it is important to not think of equities and corporate bonds in isolation. They each give exposure to different parts of a company’s capital structure. The optimal place to invest in the capital structure — equity or debt — depends on market conditions, relative value and the investor’s specific needs.
Owning the debt of a non-investment grade company can often present a better opportunity than owning its equity. Many high-yield issuers are privately held, with no listed equity, so bonds are the only way to invest in them. It is also important to note that the high-yield universe can be quite fluid, with companies graduating to investment-grade status or becoming “falling angels” that drop into high-yield territory.
Within the context of a target date fund, we believe high-yield bonds make sense in the middle of the glide path, where fixed income is expected to contribute a greater share of return as the glide path de-risks by reducing equities.
Flexibility can help participants
Target date funds hit their sweet spot, so to say, during the critical transition phase in the middle of the glide path: It is here where the allocation between equities and fixed income sees the most significant changes as the balance of risks a participant faces evolves. Flexibility is critical here, particularly in a fixed income allocation that is intended to insulate against downside shocks. A series should have the flexibility to adapt to market conditions, managing risk and seeking opportunities by shifting credit quality, duration and geographic exposure as needed.
For passive approaches, where underlying fund managers are more constrained, exposures must be changed from the top down by modifying strategic fund allocations. But this approach lacks the nimbleness of fully active approaches where flexibility is embedded at the underlying fund level. For example, balanced funds in our series allow active managers to shift between bonds and equities (and within sub-asset classes) in pursuit of the best investment opportunities on a day-to-day basis. These changes, in turn, influence the target date fund’s overall asset mix from the bottom up.
Either way, at this stage, it’s critical that the equity and fixed income managers in a target date series are evaluating markets and making decisions in concert, addressing common risks that are manifesting into different asset classes. A target date provider shouldn’t address risks in isolation. It should look at how equities and bonds interact and adjust each accordingly, to pursue better outcomes for participants.
How to help plan sponsors
Consider the various ways fixed income assets can benefit target date investors: While equity diversification remains a critical role for fixed income allocations in a target date series, a more sophisticated approach uses the asset class for other roles as well.
Appreciate the differences in fixed income allocations: While equities sometimes steal the spotlight, be sure to closely examine the differences in the approach and the value added by the fixed income allocations of a target date series. Ensure that the mix of bonds changes with the needs of investors as they move through the life cycle.
TIPS and high yield can play a role: While bonds should seek to dampen equity risk, they can also combat other risks such as inflation shocks, and can provide exposure to unique opportunities.
Exploit flexibility: Flexibility along the various dimensions of fixed income management — including duration, credit quality and geography — can protect and benefit participants transitioning into retirement.

When building a 401(k) plan, many financial professionals (FPs) typically start the process by choosing a recordkeeper and then building the investment menu. But could this conventional wisdom be backwards?
Although recordkeepers influence cost and service, investments ultimately are the engine of wealth creation for retirement. Over a participant’s working years, even small improvements in returns can add years of spending in retirement. By helping plan sponsors choose quality investments first, FPs can help improve participant outcomes and differentiate their approaches from competitors.
Better outcomes require a better plan
Retirement plans, by nature, are a series of linked components. For the plan to be successful, the assembled chain must meet the objectives of both plan sponsors and participants. Many FPs assemble these links in a conventional order that prioritizes the selection of the retirement plan recordkeeper.
A recordkeeping-driven process

If you’ve been following such a process, consider changing this sequence and start with investments first. Once you’ve talked to your client and determined their needs, you’ll likely know what type of plan makes sense for that company. From that point, rather than immediately selecting a recordkeeper, the next link in the chain should be the investment menu.

The most critical factor bridging the gap between what participants save and what they’ll need in retirement lies in the quality of the returns their plan’s investments can generate. Why? Investment returns are the primary engine that will drive outcomes over the long run. The below scenario tracks a hypothetical participant’s account balance over a working career, noting how much money came from contributions and how much was generated through investment returns (assuming a steady 6% annualized return).
For younger participants, contributions make up the bulk of the account balance. But by the time they reach retirement, 70% or more of the account balance could potentially come from returns, not contributions.
Returns matter more than you think
The demographic assumptions, returns, and ending balances are hypothetical and provided for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to provide any assurance or promise of actual returns and outcomes. Returns will be affected by the management of the investments and any adjustments to the assumed contribution rates, salary, or other participant demographic information. Actual results may be higher or lower than those shown. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods. Based on the exhibit by CBS Moneywatch, Assumptions for 70/30 rule of thumb: This hypothetical example assumes you start investing 10% of your $40,000 income at age 26. And then you continue to contribute 10% each year throughout your career, as your salary increases 3% a year.
Take another look to see how even small increases in returns can dramatically improve outcomes, adding years of retirement income.
Consider the default
Many participants end up investing the bulk of their assets in a qualified default investment alternative (QDIA) – typically a target date fund. As the foundation of most 401(k) plans, the quality of that target date fund can dramatically influence the size of a participant’s “retirement nest egg.” That’s why the choice of target date providers is one of the most important decisions for a plan sponsor – rivaling the choice of recordkeeper.
Evaluating a target date series can be a complex task. Although there are similarities among all series, each is managed differently – with varying underlying investment strategies and glide paths. Here are a few issues to consider when comparing series:
How much equity does the series have at retirement? Does the series seek to change the mix of equities over time – shifting to historically less-volatile stocks as participants age? Or does the mix of equities stay the same throughout the glide path?
What is the series’ approach to fixed income? How does the series adjust credit quality and duration as participants age?
How do the series’ returns rank against peers?
How well has the series held up in recent market corrections? Has it provided the downside resilience participants expect?
How do the fees compare relative to the value (additional returns) the series has delivered?
How well have the underlying funds (the ingredients) fared? How long are their return histories?
Finding data to answer some of these issues doesn’t have to be difficult. To evaluate different target date series and help find a QDIA for each of their clients, FPs can use Target Date ProView. This tool provides objective, third-party data on target date series in the marketplace. In just seconds, the tool can generate comparison reports analyzing key factors such as glide path, risk, returns and expenses that you can share with clients.
Evaluate core menu options
Despite the prevalence of target date funds, nearly 80% of defined contribution (DC) assets still lie outside QDIA default options.1 In creating the non-target date investment menu (core menu), some people tend to prioritize quantity of funds. The average large 401(k) plan has 21 non-target date investment options.2  For those participants who choose their own investments, research shows that too many choices can feel overwhelming.3  Simplifying the core menu, with these considerations in mind, may support better participant decision-making:
Avoid trying to “check” every style box in U.S. equity when choosing funds; instead, seek a few U.S. equity funds that can span style and market cap in pursuit of the most attractive opportunities. Although specialized and sector-focused funds may be appropriate for more investment-savvy investors, the average participant can be well-served by investing in broad U.S. core equity funds.
For international equity funds, consider strategies that invest in both emerging and developed markets. You might also consider global equity funds, which provide skilled investment managers the broadest opportunity set to identify “winners.”
Seek core bond funds that can deliver on the four main roles of fixed income in a DC plan: diversification, inflation protection, income and capital preservation. A core bond fund should provide stability during equity market downturns: Look at the bond fund’s equity-market correlation and its returns during past corrections.

FP pro tip: If you select the recordkeeper before the investments, you may find yourself faced with multiple pricing scenarios based on the QDIA desired for each platform. This will not only complicate your decision for making a confident recommendation to your client, but if you should decide to present multiple options, it will also be difficult for the client to understand.
Choose the right recordkeeper
Here are some important considerations when choosing a recordkeeper:
Cost: A key consideration is how much of the recordkeeping cost is related to recordkeeping services and how much of it comes from the investments (fund-related expenses). This is not always evident. The challenge with plan costs is that they can be difficult to understand and even harder to explain to clients.
Fee structures for retirement plans vary by recordkeeper. That’s why it’s important to understand what funds and services are included in the recordkeeper’s cost – and compare it to the potential value that can be delivered. Many plan sponsors may not even realize there is a distinction to be made between recordkeeping and investment costs. If your client considers total cost alone, they may end up with a plan that doesn’t meet their needs. On the other hand, clients also don’t want to overpay for bells and whistles they won’t use.
Cost vs. value: Hypothetical plan comparison
Source: Capital Group. Hypothetical example shows total cost using R6 shares, which do not charge sales fees.
The above hypothetical scenario considers the total recordkeeping costs of two hypothetical plans. The total costs of the plans are the same – 100 basis points. But looking at the total number alone doesn’t tell the full story. Plan sponsors should also look at the components of that cost to analyze how it relates to value.
In the example, costs are divided into three types: recordkeeping services, fund expenses and financial professional compensation. Although financial professional compensation is equal, Plan A charges four times as much for recordkeeping services. In contrast, Plan B charges four times as much for fund costs. While plan sponsors may initially have concerns over the level of fund costs in Plan B, choosing the cheapest fund isn’t necessarily best, nor is a plan obligated to do so to meet its fiduciary duty. The example highlights the importance of looking at each component of plan costs, not just the total.
For fund expenses, consider the quality of the funds that are offered. Passive funds are usually cheaper and track the returns of indexes. Given how important investment returns are to retirement readiness, plan sponsors should consider whether typically more expensive actively managed funds could deliver stronger results than indexes – either by outpacing indexes during strong markets or suffering smaller losses in down markets. Passive funds are not striving to outpace their benchmarks; rather, they seek to replicate the benchmark’s return pattern.
The bottom line is that isolating recordkeeping costs can help reveal hidden fees that could cost your clients more than they expect. Solutions that provide transparent or upfront pricing can help them understand exactly what they’re paying and what services they’re getting. Emphasize to clients that, like target date funds, not all types of fees are created equal.
Service: This is where the right combination of technology and personal touch can really make a difference. When looking at the features of a different recordkeeping solutions, focus on the true benefits and how they affect the user experience. Does the recordkeeper offer distinguishing service or technological capabilities that justify higher fees? The plan should help participants feel motivated and empowered to make the most of their company retirement plan and save for the future.
FP pro tip: You can help your clients balance the level of services needed with the cost they are comfortable paying. Furthermore, work with your providers to prepare a quote that clearly lays out what is included in their fee, broken out to show the specific amounts charged for recordkeeping services and investments. FPs can use this checklist to guide their efforts in finding the right recordkeeper for their plans.
Cost and service are two areas that can become pain points if not properly addressed. Deficiencies in either of these areas are often the reasons why a company switches retirement plan providers.
Clients need your help
Done correctly, retirement plan business can offer a great return on investment — for employers, for their employees and for FPs, helping more clients and growing their practice. Success lies in building that better 401(k).

Life expectancy is underestimated. 43% of retirees underestimate life expectancy by at least five years.1
A simplistic approach to longevity planning may overlook a client’s health and lifestyle choices, which help determine a client’s life span.
It is critical we help investors understand a more complete view of their life expectancy probabilities and the implications for retirement income planning.
Americans are living longer than ever before. Everyone knows that, it seems, except investors! Retirees frequently underestimate their life expectancy and the number of years they are likely to spend in retirement. It is critical we help investors understand their accurate life expectancy and the implications for retirement income planning. While the uncertainty of longevity cannot be eliminated, we can plan and manage for it. Let’s discuss why longevity, as well as life expectancy, needs to be top of mind in retirement income planning conversations.

What is life expectancy in the first place?
Life expectancy from birth tends to be the statistic we hear most often: a man or woman born in a certain year has X average life expectancy. This information has little relevance for someone reaching retirement age. For the purposes of retirement income planning, a more relevant statistic is life expectancy at attained age. In fact, an 84-year-old non-smoking woman in excellent health has a life expectancy of about seven years and a 10% probability of living for another 14 years.2  At age 65, both males and females can expect to live into their late 80s (based on median life-expectancy probability). For a 65-year-old couple, one spouse can expect to live into their 90s, as shown in Figure 3.3  But this picture can also mislead planning for a retirement income horizon because these statistics are based on the median probability of the entire population. While the term “life span” refers to the maximum number of years an individual can live, “life expectancy” refers to an estimate or an average number of years a person can expect to live. Many of your investors may have a survival probability that is much greater than the median as there are large differences in life expectancy depending on various economic and demographic factors.

Consider contributing factors 
To provide more perspective for clients, consider utilizing individual mortality factors such as gender, smoking choices and general state of health to sharpen the life expectancy estimate.4  This will help to ensure the planning horizon matches up with clients’ actual financial longevity risk and can provide your clients a more accurate picture of their retirement income planning horizon. For instance, suppose your investor is a 65-year-old woman who smokes and self-reports average health. Utilizing the Longevity Illustrator,5  she has a 50% chance of living at least another 15 years (to age 80), compared to age 88 if she were a non-smoker. But she also has a 25% probability of living at least another 22 years (to age 87). And if she were a non-smoker, she would be likely to live another 29 years (to age 94). This range illustrates the uncertainty surrounding how long someone might live. These results may surprise many, considering that 43% of retirees and 38% of pre-retirees underestimate life expectancy by at least five years, according to a survey from the Society of Actuaries.6  Underestimating life expectancy, together with having too short a planning horizon, can result in inadequate planning for retirement income needs. Consider discussing these contributing longevity factors and median statistics as part of your client conversations.

363,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/ir-missing-participants.html,Tackling the problem of missing participants,Practice Management,"June 11, 2021","Over the past decade, the problem of missing retirement plan participants — those with a balance in their former employer’s qualified retirement plan (e.g. 401(k) plans) but who have lost contact with the company — has steadily grown. Worse, many plan sponsors don’t fully understand the significance of this situation.—
Rest assured, the Department of Labor (DOL) does. Their Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) has stepped up audit investigations into plan sponsors who may not be doing all that they can to track down these lost participants and reconnect them with their money.
Financial professionals (FPs) have an outstanding opportunity to proactively reach out to their existing retirement plan clients and demonstrate value by shedding some light on the subject.
What causes missing participants?
In today’s transient workforce, it isn’t unusual for workers to leave a balance in their former employer’s retirement plan. But as time goes by, these workers may lose track of the plans in which they have an account, especially when events occur that change the plan (e.g., mergers, acquisitions, recordkeeper changes, changes to the plan sponsor’s name).
On the other hand, plan sponsors may lose contact with former employees when they:
move to a new residence,
get married or divorced and change their names, or
pass away.
In the bustle of life changes, it may not occur to participants to contact a former employer with updated information. If the employee left involuntarily, he or she may not feel comfortable making contact.
Another type of missing participant is someone who is simply unresponsive. They may have received a distribution check but haven’t cashed it. For example, someone might feel it’s not worth cashing a $10 check for a trailing dividend that was credited to their account.
And in some cases, possibly those auto-enrolled in the plan, former employees may not even realize they have an account at all. So, they never seek to claim what’s rightfully theirs.
FP Tip: Emphasize to clients that the longer a participant goes missing, the harder it can be to find them later. Early red flags to watch for are distribution checks, quarterly statements or service emails that are sent but returned undeliverable.
What’s at stake
A missing participant can be a costly proposition for participants and plan sponsors alike.
Participant: In the face of a serious nationwide retirement savings gap, many investors can’t afford to leave money on the table that could otherwise help them retire with dignity. And in the event of their death, their loved ones could miss out on valuable beneficiary death benefits.
Some plan designs provide for the transfer of uncashed checks for missing participants to the plan’s forfeiture account after reasonable steps have been taken to locate the participant. Although the plan would be required to pay the benefit should the participant make a claim for the forfeited, the participant can end up worse off by missing out on any gains that might have accrued if the money had remained in the investment account.
Plan sponsors: Administrative burdens and increased plan costs aside, there is the concerning possibility that an audit may find the sponsor did not make reasonable efforts to locate missing participants and is in breach of their fiduciary duty.   
FP Tip: While the failure to timely make a required minimum distribution (RMD) is among the potential qualification issues for a plan, the IRS addressed this issue as it relates to missing participants. IRS field guidance directs auditors not to challenge a qualified plan for failure to make an RMD to a missing participant, provided certain steps have been taken to locate the participant.    
Encourage clients to develop a plan of action
In their capacity as fiduciaries, plan sponsors are tasked with determining and taking appropriate steps to locate and distribute retirement benefits to missing participants. While this may seem like a daunting task, the good news is that technology and new guidance have made it easier than ever for sponsors to succeed.
FPs serving these clients can offer ideas to consider:
Decide who will manage missing participants — New guidance from the DOL (see below) states “the first step in addressing any problem often is knowing that there is one.” Many plan sponsors believe that their plan’s third-party administrator (TPA) and/or recordkeeper are responsible for locating missing participants. But unless these providers have agreed to provide such a service, the plan sponsor is responsible. Therefore, the plan sponsor should ask service providers about their policies and procedures relating to locating missing participants.
Many recordkeepers can provide a report of participants with uncashed checks and undeliverable mail and/or email. That can serve as a starting point for managing lost participants.
FP Tip: Plan sponsors may want to consider delegating the responsibility to a third-party-service provider that specializes in this area. It is important to remember that while sponsors may delegate to third-party service providers, it is their fiduciary duty to ensure that the delegate’s procedures are adequate.
Formalize a plan — If the plan sponsor retains the responsibility for managing missing participants, they will need to determine the steps they will take to locate missing participants. Any processes or procedures that are implemented should be documented and followed. Having sufficient documentation could be especially important in the case of a DOL audit.
To date, sponsors have found themselves frustrated with a lack of clear direction on specifically what must be done to avoid trouble. But new DOL guidance issued in January 2021 details steps that plan fiduciaries should consider to locate and distribute retirement benefits to missing or nonresponsive participants. While Missing Participants - Best Practices for Pension Plans does provide some helpful insight, it falls short of creating any type of “safe harbor” for plan fiduciaries to rely upon. It does, however, allow a plan sponsor to consider what search measures are appropriate for its particular plan, including balancing the size of the account involved against the cost of the search efforts.
More to come
The issue of missing participants is such a growing problem that in 2020, in spite of a divided government, new bipartisan retirement legislation (referred to as SECURE Act 2.0) was introduced in Congress. Included are several provisions aimed at improving how Americans save for retirement, as well as a provision that would establish an online lost-and-found database for retirement accounts. While SECURE Act 2.0 has a long road to walk before it becomes law, the concept of a single national database would undoubtedly help Americans find retirement savings held by their former employers.

In a crowded marketplace, what makes your retirement practice stand out? Your brand.
What’s so important about having a retirement brand? Many clients think all financial professionals are pretty much the same, and that they say the same things. Branding allows you stand out from this “sea of sameness,” helping you to attract and retain more retirement plan clients.

The four D’s of building a better brand
Even if you already have a brand in place, revisit it frequently to ensure it is performing at its best and helping you stay ahead of competitors. Consider the following four steps to help refresh your brand:
1. Define: A clear, definitive statement about what you do and why is a critical first step to break through the noise and showcase yourself and your team with retirement plan clients and prospects. If you have a value proposition, make sure it is targeted to the needs of retirement plans. Consider the following questions:
Why retirement plans?
Why have you chosen to add retirement plans to your business?
What is the most satisfying part of working with retirement plans?
What services do you provide retirement plans?
What do you do for plan sponsors? For plan participants?
What is unique about your practice?
Whom do you serve?
How would you describe the plans you serve today?
What kinds of plans are the best fit for you and why?
2. Differentiate: To help build your retirement plan business, you need to be able to effectively describe the specific ways you serve plan sponsors and participants. While being a 401(k)-plan advisor is itself a differentiator, you can distinguish yourself further by:
Identifying the types of plan sponsor clients you serve
Communicating to plan sponsors that you truly understand the unique challenges of their participants
When describing your differentiating qualities, use language you are comfortable using in everyday conversations, avoiding jargon. For a more personal touch, include some background about how and why you became involved in the 401(k) business.
3. Demonstrate: Today’s most successful brands demonstrate on a daily basis that they remain laser-focused on understanding customer’s needs. Once you’ve defined and differentiated your brand, demonstrate it by showing how much you value your clients. This starts with listening. Initiate conversations with plan sponsors to help you uncover gaps between the service you provide and your clients’ expectations. To understand your client’s needs better, we suggest you:
Ask clients why they chose you and why they stay. For those who left, ask why they did so.
Survey a subset of clients to find out what they value most about your relationship.
Ensure your firm’s marketing materials convey that you understand plan sponsor and participant needs.
4. Digitize: If you do business by smartphone or tablet, you need to have an effective digital presence. Make sure you’re not neglecting these important areas:
Make your virtual meetings successful: Even after the coronavirus pandemic subsides, many plan sponsors and participants will still work remotely, so virtual meetings are likely here to stay. But even in this home-office environment, your brand is still being represented, so make sure your surroundings reflect that. While it may sound like common sense, simple things like having an uncluttered background and technology that works properly will convey your seriousness and professionalism.
Revisit your social media bio: According to a study from Greenwich Associates1, more than half the advisors surveyed have increased their activity on LinkedIn and/or Twitter in the past year. If you haven’t refreshed your LinkedIn profile or website bio since before the pandemic, now is the ideal time to do so. Use your responses to the above questions to write a website bio and LinkedIn profile that helps you stand out as a retirement plan professional.
Make your social media truly social: But merely having a strong profile is not enough. As the 401(k) Marketing blog recently pointed out, “For social media to work, you have to join the conversation. This means publishing regular content, liking, commenting, sharing and even joining groups.” Of course, use of social media for business purposes is subject to home office approval, and financial professionals should seek approval before engaging in any social media practices outlined here.

Here are some best practices for showcasing your brand online:
Ensure your team profiles are consistent across digital platforms.
Connect with clients on LinkedIn by sending personalized invitations.
Develop a weekly plan to post and share content through social media.
Segment your social media content strategy based on specific needs of plan sponsors and plan participants in your network, keeping in mind that both groups will see your posts.Develop a weekly plan to post and share content through social media.
Putting it all together
Competing in today’s retirement plan marketplace poses increasing challenges. A brand that speaks to the spoken and unspoken needs of retirement plan sponsors can make you stand out in the sea of sameness.

Some of them are 40 years old, many with kids and a mortgage – and running out of time to get a healthy start on saving for retirement. In that regard, many of them need plan sponsors’ help. This generation seems overconfident about their retirement readiness, faces serious financial challenges and could use some financial guidance.
Capital Group’s latest Wisdom of Experience survey of 1,200 retail investors found some interesting trends across generations. The survey reveals that millennials are far more confident than the previous generation: 74% of millennials expect to reach their retirement goals, while their Generation X predecessors are the least confident, with 37% indicating they are not confident they will reach their retirement goals.

Millennial confidence: Reality tells a different story
While millennials report feeling confident about retirement, a closer look at the survey results shows that this confidence might be misplaced. According to our survey, 41% of millennials report needing $500,000 or less to retire comfortably, which is far below what experts generally regard as necessary for retirement.
And while the good news is that 8 in 10 millennials say they have money saved for retirement, the majority (67%) have saved less than $50,000.1  Even among higher income earners ($150,000+ annually), 25% have less than $50,000 in retirement savings.
Millennials are saving, but not enough

Competing priorities may be holding millennials back
Despite high levels of confidence, the truth is that millennials are under financial stress, which may prevent them from saving as much as they want. Millennials started their careers during the Great Recession, a period marked by high unemployment and sluggish wage growth.
From housing to childcare to education, millennials are paying more for just about everything relative to their parents’ and grandparents’ generations and this is having an impact on their retirement readiness. About 40% of millennial households are saddled with student debt, with outstanding loan balances on those amounts accounting for more than 40% of income.2  And they face higher housing costs. Data show that millennials dedicate more of their annual spending to housing than any other generation and they rate housings cost as their greatest financial responsibility.

Engaging millennials: Why it matters to your retirement plan
As more and more baby boomers retire daily, millennials are expected to account for 75% of the workforce by 2025. More than previous generations, millennials highly value job satisfaction and want to feel that their employer cares about them. Millennials are more likely to change jobs due to mounting financial pressures or because they don’t feel engaged with their employers. Yet many plan sponsors may be unaware of these facts, which gives an advisor a great opportunity to explain why plan sponsors need to pay attention to these issues and use their retirement plan and other benefits to help reduce attrition, maintain employee satisfaction and improve hiring.
How plan sponsors can help
Promote the 401(k) plan to millennials: Advisors should remind plan sponsors that a 401(k) plan can not only be a powerful tool in addressing millennials’ financial pressures; it can also help attract and retain them by showing them that the employer cares. Employees who feel their employer values them are more likely to be engaged in their workplace and stay with the company longer, reducing the high cost of employee turnover.
Focus on financial education: Discuss with the plan sponsor how tailoring retirement plan education and advice to millennial needs and interests could help. Our surveys showed that millennials are interested in simplified plan menus and better fund descriptions to help them make better investment decisions. And despite embracing the do-to-it-yourself (DIY) culture for solving many of life’s problems, Capital Group’s survey found that more than any other generation, millennials desire additional education and tools to navigate their retirement plans – particularly when it comes to personalized advice on how to invest (42%).
Provide student loan assistance: Explore ways plan sponsors could help employees pay off student debt. Plan sponsors could do this by contributing a small amount monthly to eligible employees or experimenting with an employer match. There is currently a proposal under the SECURE Act 2.0 that would permit employers to pay down a student loan instead of contributing to a 401(k) plan and still receive an employer match in their retirement plan. Student repayment assistance can be costly for employers, so this conversation might not be appropriate for every plan sponsor. But for those who could make it work, this benefit could be a powerful recruitment and retention tool, as 41% of millennials rank student loan repayment assistance as one of the top employer benefits.3
Tailor employee communications: When advisors or plan sponsors are discussing retirement plans and other benefits, try to orient the conversation to match the needs of different generations. Baby boomers and millennials are in very different financial situations. Aligning the message’s content and tone to the various age groups in the room could make educational or enrollment session more effective, while showing that the employer understands each generation’s concerns.

Study details
In 2019, Capital Group partnered with a large health care provider to help understand employees’ retirement savings behavior. The study involved more than 20 employee interviews and data analysis. Particular attention was given to the employer’s priority demographic groups, such as lower income earners (earning less than $55,000/year), over-55-year-olds and certain job roles, such as nurses. Based on insights from that work, we segmented employees into three groups:
Avoiders, who had little knowledge of retirement issues and had not taken any action to increase or decrease their retirement savings rate.
Late bloomers, who were pre-retirees and needed to catch up or sought further guidance.
Motivated Millennials and Gen X, who were more informed and wanted to learn more advanced savings topics. These employees had increased their savings on the margins, but not enough to be prepared for retirement.
Next, we came up with tailored messages for each group, addressing specific barriers to retirement savings. We found that customizing messages helped ensure that employees get relevant and relatable content.
What types of savers are in your plan?
In partnership with a major health care firm, we segmented participants into three behavioral types. We used participant data and insights from interviews to target communications based on each type's interests and needs.

Of course, these personas may not apply to every employer. Plan sponsors should consider doing their own interviews and data analysis to see how to best segment their participants. However, based on our work with this company, there are three key lessons that we believe broadly apply to DC plans.
1. Meet participants where they are
Employees’ time and attention are pulled in many directions. Finding the right moment to communicate with employees can be a complex task.
At this organization, many employees were nurses, whose jobs were not tied to mobile-phone or computer screens. Often, they would review emails just before their shift, at lunch and in the evening. Communication that was not directly tied to their job or patient care, such as information about retirement plans, was mostly deleted or ignored. In addition, many employees did not use their employer-provided email account. In order to be noticed, emails needed to be directed to personal accounts.
Reach employees at the right times
The health care firm discovered that its messages weren't being delivered at the ideal times. Most messages were being sent during working hours, even though research showed workers were more receptive during off-hours
Source: Capital Group.
Here are some ideas on how sponsors can meet employees where they are:
Communicate at the right times. Find out when your employees are most receptive to messaging. For some companies, this may be pre-shift. For others, it may be mid-afternoon or on the weekend. The key is to deliver messages that can be easily accessed from anywhere during times when employees are in the right mindset. Keep in mind too that your goal is to capture employees’ attention and provide consistent nudging to help them act.
Tailor messaging. Consider employees’ specific needs and key priorities, perhaps with the help of employee interviews or data analysis. Needs may differ based on demographics or the types of jobs. For example, sponsors can customize communications according to age group, explaining the merits of investing in age-appropriate target date funds or participating in an investment re-enrollment.
Use different channels: Targeted content can be delivered via email nudging, mobile phone messages, physical and digital signage or multimedia campaigns (videos or podcasts).
Reduce complexity. Make it seamless for employees and bring all the information together in one place. As much as possible, make messages short and action items easy to complete in a few minutes, as the employee’s attention may be limited. It may be helpful for plan sponsors to provide one online destination point to access retirement information. Content should be simply and concisely worded. It should also provide convenient links to other resources such as wellness providers, educational resources and other employee benefits. Avoid requiring passwords when appropriate/possible to help ensure employees are not overwhelmed by a complex landscape of logins and portals.
2. Cut through barriers
We found that resistance to retirement planning often had less to do with logistics and more to do with emotions. For example, many people expressed shame around their lack of knowledge or savings, or feared that they’re too far behind in savings to catch up. They also felt overwhelmed by competing needs, which included everyday expenses, debt and family demands.
Communication that ignored these factors alienated employees. We had much better luck with messaging that sought to speak to emotional realities, taking care not to exacerbate shame or fear. This included plain language – what we call “kitchen-table English” – and a reassuring, helpful tone. That said, we believe messaging tone is key to illustrate empathy. To prove this point, we tested participant messages using different tones to match employees’ moods. Specifically, we tested different tones of messages before and after the COVID-19 pandemic hit and found very different results.
Match the tone to the employee mood

Here are some recommendations on how sponsors can cut through barriers:
Address emotional obstacles. Understand your employees’ emotional roadblocks so you can help the employee move past them.
Speak plainly and empathetically. Use friendly, welcoming language that is easy to understand and would resonate well with employees.
Lay out options. Content that details specific options available and the pros/cons of each performed well at this organization. This can help employees quickly evaluate tradeoffs in a clear format.
3. Establish trust
Unfortunately, many employees’ trust in financial services and even in their employer is low. This is a trend recorded across industries and institutions, with trust waning as a sense of inequity and unfairness rises. As the voice of an institution, it can be challenging to convince these individuals you’re on their side. This is a significant hurdle to overcome in helping employees seek better retirement outcomes.
To increase trust, you might want to look to sources employees do trust. You’ll also be more likely to earn trust with authentic communication that tonally matches the subject matter than with overly formal or disingenuous messaging.
Here are some recommendations on how sponsors can establish trust:
Enlist allies. Employees have strong connections with colleagues who are part of their “circle of trust.” We found that people place a great deal of weight on advice from trusted peers, including on financial matters. It may be good to seek the help of influencers who speak the employee’s language, to reach them on an emotional level. Consider recruiting these influencers as ambassadors to help other employees understand the retirement plan and how small decisions now can make significant long-term impact.
Match the mood. Adjust the tone of the communications in response to internal and external events. For example, a sunny tone may be appropriate for discussing the employer match, but it may be more appropriate to take a somber and reassuring approach to addressing market volatility.
Above all – listen
Our biggest learning from this study was that employees all differ in needs, preferences and priorities. A plan sponsor should listen to employees to find out what matters to them. We believe messages that aren’t accessible and relevant to an individual in the moment they receive it will not be effective – even if the content is helpful or important to their long-term goals. As stewards of retirement savings, plan sponsors can empower individuals. They can do this by meeting employees where they are, cutting through barriers and showing trustworthiness.

368,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/ir-three-tools.html,3 tools to help build your retirement plan practice,Practice Management,"March 23, 2021","2020 was an exceptionally challenging year for small businesses, with the pandemic’s impact varying dramatically across industries and sectors. For example, the restaurant chain that was closed for months had a very different experience from the doctor’s office that had been busier than usual.
Amid the disruption caused by COVID-19, plan sponsors may have prioritized the business at hand over their retirement plans. However, there are useful tools at every financial professional’s (FP’s) disposal to help sponsors look beyond current uncertainties and position their plans for future success. As the COVID situation gets more in control, these tools can help FPs keep their relationships in good shape and strengthen their competitive advantage. And NOW may be the perfect time for FPs to think about positioning retirement plans for the long term.
Here are the three tools you can use:
Tool #1
Good service: Essential to building relationships
Fees, investments and fiduciary risk management are standard fare in any meeting between an FP and plan sponsor. But good service can give FPs a real competitive advantage. As FPs face a growing competitive threat from state-sponsored retirement plans or other pooled plans, delivering valuable service to sponsor and participant will be a key differentiator. To do that,
Be available: Small business owners are time-constrained, focused on growing their businesses. They want prompt responses from and easy access to their recordkeepers and financial professionals. They don’t have time to wait on hold. Being available to sponsors also means:
Tailoring the message: Some businesses may have weathered the COVID storm and are ready to discuss revising or expanding the plan. Others are still hurting and may just be trying to keep the plan operating. These two groups will have different needs and questions.
Providing participant education: During volatile markets, such as the COVID-driven correction in early 2020, sponsors look to FPs to help discourage participants from impulsive decision-making. These moments provide an opportunity to teach participants about the importance of remaining invested, using materials like Capital Group’s Guide to Uncertain Markets. At the same time, FPs also need to be ready to discuss whether participants are investing too conservatively to build a big enough nest egg to generate sustainable income in retirement.
Put in face time (as soon as you are able): The pandemic showed that virtual meetings are an effective tool. But after COVID hopefully subsides, in-person meetings will still be valuable, given that a big part of communication is nonverbal and not perfectly captured on a computer camera.
Tool #2
Advocacy: Bring renewed attention to retirement plans
With the end of the COVID-19 crisis in sight, now may be an ideal time to bring small business owners’ attention back to the benefits and responsibilities of a strong retirement plan. This can be done by:
Holding regular review meetings around the same time each year: This will keep sponsors engaged and focused on their plans. FPs can help sponsors review plan fees, service and menus, as well as look for ways to boost participation engagement to grow plan assets.
Stressing the importance of a retirement plan: Remind sponsors that good retirement plans are key to attract and retain talented employees. As the economy improves, a good retirement plan can be a significant competitive advantage in the labor market.
Reminding sponsors of their commitment: The sponsor still needs to be doing the basic work to meet fiduciary obligations. Now may be a good time to review or streamline the investment menu. In addition, FPs may want to review the results of the plan’s target date funds. For example, how did the funds fare versus competitors in the sharp equity-market downturn seen in the first quarter of 2020? Did the funds provide the desired resilience?
Keeping them up to date: Inform sponsors about what’s on the horizon on the legislative and regulatory front. Now may be a good time to re-educate them on the previously approved Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act or preview similar legislation that Congress may consider this year.
Providing options to address more participants staying in plan: Educate and provide sponsors on their options regarding retirement income solutions and distribution flexibility.
Tool #3
Focus: Drive the conversation toward participant outcomes
At the end of the day, it’s all about participant outcomes. FPs can help sponsors focus on this goal.
Explore auto features: Discuss the advantages and challenges of auto-enrollment and auto-escalation, which have proven effective for increasing participation rates and contribution levels in a plan. Also discuss the potential benefit of an investment re-enrollment, which would move all participants’ plan assets into the plan’s default investment (usually a target date series) unless they opt out.
Stretch the employer match: Give employees incentives to save more by getting creative with the employee match. For example, a sponsor could match 50 cents on the dollar up to 3%, then dollar for dollar for another 3%.
Discuss retirement income: DC plans that are the sole retirement savings vehicle or those with older workers may be interested in learning about potential retirement income options.
Discuss costs: For recordkeeping arrangements, it may make sense for some plans to move from an asset-based pricing model to a fixed-priced model.
Review wellness initiatives: FPs may want to discuss other benefits that can work alongside a retirement plan to improve participants’ personal and financial wellness. For example, consider discussing the potential advantages of health savings accounts.
Conclusion
Looking beyond pandemic-related uncertainties, we believe there are reasons for optimism, including a potentially strong economic recovery. With this recovery in sight, financial professionals have an opportunity to help plan sponsors/business owners shift their attention back to building and maintaining strong retirement plans.

369,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/ir-dc-retirement-income.html,Build retirement income options in a DC plan,Investment Menu,"March 22, 2021","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
We are seeing more retirement plan participants remaining in a defined contribution (DC) plan after leaving the workforce. DC plans must evolve to help these workers translate their savings into sustainable retirement income.
Plans need to provide retirees with flexible withdrawal options, such as lump sum, systematic and ad hoc withdrawals. Some recordkeeping systems already offer these.
Sponsors are adding investment options designed to support retirement income, as part of an “in-retirement tier” in the DC investment menu. This tier could include options such as annuities and investment strategies that can generate sustainable retirement income.
Such strategies can live alongside a target date series providing additional options to meet various objectives.
Forty years ago, DC plans were created as supplemental savings plans. Today, they are an important source of retirement income for many retirees and future retirees.
As their importance grows, DC plans must continue evolving to ultimately develop into a truly effective retirement solution. DC systems need to enable employees to save money throughout their career and then help them convert those savings into a “retirement paycheck.” Employers may need to rethink their plans to help facilitate retirees’ distributions. This goal will become even more important if – as we are seeing – an increasing number of retirees choose to remain in the DC plan after leaving the workforce.
The ability to stay in the DC plan can benefit both employee and sponsor
The ability to continue in a DC plan after retirement, instead of rolling out, for example, into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), can be a meaningful benefit for an employee. The advantages may include continued employer fiduciary oversight over investment options, access to institutionally priced investments and low-fee administration.
For the employer, encouraging retirees to stay in plan is a competitive and valuable benefit, as retirees typically have greater assets. By keeping those assets in plan, employers can create economies of scale that could help lower plan expenses, as shown in the chart below.

Access to distribution and recordkeeping options gives retirees flexibility
When DC plans were supplemental savings plans, they would often only allow for a lump-sum withdrawal, usually upon termination or retirement. This has changed and many plans today offer withdrawal options that include lump sum, ad hoc and systematic.
This type of flexibility makes the DC plan work for retirees who may use their savings in different ways at various points in retirement. Key to this success is ensuring that fees to take withdrawals are reasonable so they don't deter participants from taking ad-hoc or systematic distributions.
Recordkeeping systems, while originally designed for the accumulation phase of an employee’s retirement plan, are now more flexible than ever.
Attitudes and systems have evolved rapidly, leading to flexible distribution strategies designed to meet the needs of today’s retiree without adding burdensome costs to the process.
The tables below provide general information about distribution option flexibility and pricing, based on our survey of recordkeepers in the marketplace.
Availability of distribution options
Fees for typical distribution services
*Recordkeeping arrangements vary. Examples of additional fees: Plan A: $60 for periodic distribution setup and $15 for each periodic installment. Plan B: $50 for full or partial withdrawals, but no fee on periodic installments. Source: Capital Group.
Add a retirement tier to the investment menu
Many DC plans today offer a tiered investment menu, generally consisting of Tier 1 with the qualified default investment alternative (typically a target date series) and Tier 2 with investment options for participants to create their own portfolio. In Tier 1, a “through” target date fund (managed for a number of years after the retirement date) can help participants retire successfully by gradually reducing risk over time and providing income options in retirement.
Moreover, we suggest considering adding a Tier 3 – an in-retirement tier – that would include options specifically designed to provide additional options for income in retirement.
In our framework, we divide Tier 3 options in two ways:
Flexible income sources (from investments whose value may fluctuate)
Protected income sources (defined benefits or annuities that come with more certainty)
We also classify options as being offered within the DC plan and outside of the DC plan.
Within the DC plan, an in-retirement tier could offer targeted withdrawal or managed payout funds, which seek to provide regular withdrawals from a portfolio of equities and bonds. These products are classified as “flexible income” options because they don’t come with guarantees.
Outside of the DC plan, an in-retirement tier could offer protected income sources such as a defined benefit payment or an annuity-buying service. The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act provided plan sponsors with clarification on the selection of lifetime income solutions, which include protected retirement income. However, employers can likely offer more options to retirees by placing these options outside the plan.
The graphic below shows an example of how the investment structure prior to retirement, through retirement and in retirement could be organized and communicated.

Conclusion
DC plans must evolve to effectively meet the needs of current and future retirees by helping workers translate their savings into sustainable retirement income. Sponsors can do this by offering in-retirement menu options, facilitating flexible distribution strategies and offering a “through” target date fund. These moves could benefit both participants and sponsors in their quest for a successful retirement plan designed for the long term.

370,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/ir-biden-dol-rule.html,Washington update: New fiduciary rule to go into effect,Regulation & Legislation,"February 24, 2021","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
The Biden administration is letting the rule go into effect.
The rule makes the first workable path to a fiduciary brokerage business model. 
We expect it to accelerate the growth of fee-based advisory business.
The Biden administration has announced that it will allow a fiduciary rule finalized at the end of the Trump administration to go into effect with compliance required by December 20, 2021. The announcement is somewhat surprising since some have been critical of the rule. 
The rule package provides new color on when investment recommendations to a retirement plan fiduciary, participant or IRA owner result in fiduciary status. It also provides an exemption for common transactions with potential conflicts of interest. Finally, it extends the existing DOL non-enforcement policy until December 20. 
The new rule affects both retirement plan and IRA professionals
Tightly coordinated with the newly enacted Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI), the DOL rule applies more broadly to registered investment advisers and brokers providing advice to retail clients as well as institutional retirement plan clients. While the rule makes it harder to avoid fiduciary status, it provides a reasonable method for satisfying the requirements of fiduciary status while continuing to receive non-fee-based compensation (commissions, 12b-1 fees, sub-transfer agency fees). 
The guidance would apply only to recommendations to retirement plans, participants and IRAs. This could have a significant impact on plan professionals because the new rule would be enforceable by plaintiffs in the retirement plan context. There is no private right of action to enforce the rule in the context of IRAs.
Essentially, most retirement plan professionals will either: 
Act as a fiduciary and rely on the proposed new exemption to continue receiving brokerage compensation, OR
Fully embrace a fiduciary fee-based business model and sidestep the requirements of the new exemption
Key aspects of the DOL rule
1) A reinstatement of the DOL’s five-part test for determining fiduciary status that was a critical part of the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act (ERISA) Code enacted in 1974. However, this rule also reinterprets the five-part test, expanding the definition of what would be considered fiduciary action. So now, for example, most retirement plan advice and many IRA rollover recommendations would be treated as fiduciary advice. 
2) An exemption that would allow investment fiduciaries to receive compensation for nondiscretionary investment advice, as long as they acknowledge fiduciary status in writing and adhere to the impartial conduct standards under current securities law: 
Advice must be solely in the best interest of the client, 
The compensation paid must be reasonable, and
Statements made about the transaction cannot be misleading. The exemption would be available to registered investment advisers, broker-dealer firms, insurance companies, banks and individuals who are their employees or agents.
3) Expanded regulation of rollovers will add to complex rules that are already in place. The guidance takes the position that all rollover recommendations where the financial professional and the investor reasonably expect an ongoing advice relationship (for example, a rollover to an advisory account) will be considered fiduciary recommendations. Moreover, the exemption requires that the financial professional document in writing why the rollover recommendation is in the investor’s best interests, taking into account the investments and fees in the plan. While this documentation is a best practice under Reg BI, the new rule takes it further by making it a requirement as well as mandating delivery of the written explanation to the investor. 
4) An annual review must be conducted to ensure compliance with the conditions of the new DOL rule, including exemption requirements. Specifically, a senior executive officer of the broker-dealer firm (such as its chief compliance officer) would need to sign off on the review.
What happens next is still uncertain 
Many firms and professionals may grapple with the implications of formally accepting the status of fiduciary. Such a position could increase exposure to class action lawsuits, even when advice is rendered in the spirit of the client’s best interests. 
Affected parties may be concerned that the DOL will propose further changes. We believe the financial services industry will likely advocate against making additional changes until the effects of Reg BI and the new fiduciary rule are evaluated. 
However, the Biden administration has indicated that it will evaluate whether additional changes are appropriate to the Trump rule.

371,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/ir-menu-science.html,Looking at a retirement plan menu as a … menu.,Investment Menu,"February 2, 2021","Are you confused by long menus at a restaurant? Plan sponsors face the same challenges with their investment menus, which can lead to participant inaction and imbalanced portfolios. The science behind restaurant menus may provide some insight into how to combat this.
The science of menu engineering
Did you know menus are designed to make it easier for you to choose the meal you want? “The restaurant industry has probably spent tens of billions of dollars over the years trying to understand menu design, menu engineering and psychology,” according to restaurant consultant Aaron Allen. Every item you see on a menu is placed in a precise location to drive customer behavior, which often comes down to making difficult choices easier and quicker.
Examples of menu engineering
Menu engineering naturally extends to the number of options diners have. “More than seven is too many, five is optimal and three is magical,” according to menu engineer Gregg Rapp.
Streamlined menus make it easier for diners to choose — and take less time to read.
We can learn something from this in the retirement plan industry.
78% of DC assets are outside of the default option
Despite the success of target date funds as a “one-stop” solution for retirement plan participants, most defined contribution (DC) participants are still “do-it-yourself” investors who pick funds off the investment menu.
With 20 funds on an average plan’s menu, this may be too much choice, and can lead to decision paralysis.
How did DC menus get so big? The Morningstar style box, which was originally intended to be a descriptive evaluation of a manager's investment style, has turned into something prescriptive — as building blocks for portfolios.
Some action steps for reducing plan menu size:
U.S. equity
Checking all the style boxes is no substitute for offering a small number of well-thought-out U.S. equity menu options. 
1. Beware too many entrees — Make participants’ decisions easier by limiting U.S. equity menu options to three or four funds with clear and distinct investment objectives. 
2. Fusion outside the style box — Select funds that capture a broader range of styles, market capitalizations and sectors to make it easier for participants to digest.
2. Consider participants’ appetite for risk — Look to pure growth funds for younger participants and to more dividend-oriented “blue chip” equities for those nearing retirement.
International/global
Funds with broad geographic flexibility may be used as core international/global menu offerings to simplify and direct participant choices.
1. “It’s good for you” — Treat non-U.S. equities in participant education efforts as the vegetables participants may not want to eat but don’t get enough of. Many participants are “home biased,” preferring more familiar U.S. companies to less-familiar foreign names.
2. The global smoothie — Make non-U.S. exposure easier to stomach by offering global funds, which combine unfamiliar non-U.S. firms with more familiar, multinational companies. 
3. Don’t attempt the exotic at home — Let portfolio managers, not participants, strike the right balance between developed and emerging markets exposure. Consider an international equity fund with flexibility to invest meaningfully in emerging markets.
Fixed income
One core fixed income menu option that has done what it’s supposed to do without unpleasant surprises can go a long way toward providing balance in a retirement plan. 
1. Balance the meal — Use bond funds to help dampen portfolio volatility in four ways: diversification from equities, capital preservation, income and inflation protection.
2. Don’t get fancy — Emphasize core bond funds that stay true to their role by not reaching for yield at the expense of too much credit or duration risk. 
3. Taste before appearance — Evaluate how fixed income actually behaved in real-market conditions instead of just relying on benchmark or category to approximate risk and return levels.

373,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/ir-td-bond-risk.html,Look out for bond risk in target date funds,Target Date,"December 1, 2020","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Ultra-low interest rates have fueled a rise in BBB issuance and a reach for yield. 
This trend could be raising risks in some target date funds, especially for older investors.
Millions of investors rely on their target date funds to not only help grow wealth, but preserve that wealth during bouts of market volatility. Traditionally, target date providers have relied on high-quality bonds to help provide this balance.
But credit quality can vary significantly within these funds’ bond exposure, even within investment-grade credit (rated BBB/Baa and above). Investment-grade bonds of lower credit quality have tended to fare worse in equity-market downturns. And the risk could be rising in today’s uncertain economic environment, given increased corporate leverage and a rise in lower quality bond issuance.
While this presents downside risks to all participants, investors closer to or in retirement are particularly vulnerable. To evaluate a series’ potential to cushion downturns, plan sponsors may want to closely examine their series’ fixed income portfolio — both in isolation and in relation to the equity portion of the glide path. 
An abundance of riskier credit
Ultra-low interest rates have led some investors to extend down the credit spectrum in search of yield. As a result, lower quality issuance has surged in the investment-grade market. Indeed, credits in the lowest rung of investment-grade now make up nearly one-half of the total U.S. investment-grade corporate bond market, according to J.P. Morgan. That’s up from a low of about 20% in 1992.
And while these bonds do generate higher income, they behave more like equities when it comes to risk. For example, during the first-quarter equity selloff, BBB bonds (the lowest rung) posted a –7.39% return, according to an analysis of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index. In contrast, the AAA portion of the index posted a 5.81% gain. Although good security selection can help overcome this vulnerability, these lower quality bonds also risk becoming “fallen angels” via rating downgrades — potentially exposing investors to further losses. 
BBB bonds have lagged in corrections
Check for interactions
As a result of BBB’s history of increased risk, plan sponsors may want to take a closer look at the credit quality of target date funds. For example, a passive series tracking major bond indexes could have seen its BBB exposure increase alongside the broader market. An actively managed series may have also taken on more credit risk by investing in lower quality investment-grade credits in a reach for yield.
We saw this trend when examining the BBB exposure of the four largest 2025 target date funds by mutual fund assets. As of June 30, the sole passively managed fund in that group had 20.8% of its fixed income assets in BBB bonds — up from just 15.2% five years earlier. Among the other three, actively managed funds, BBB exposure varied a lot — ranging from 9.5% to 19.8%, according to Morningstar data.
To be sure, exposure to high-yield and BBB-rated bonds is not always problematic. Yet, the big risk comes when these bonds are paired with an equity-heavy glide path, especially near retirement. This combination of more volatile assets can impair a target date fund’s ability to cushion market declines. 
Questions to evaluate risk
When evaluating a target date series, plan sponsors should consider the underlying bond risk and how that risk integrates with equities — particularly in vintages in and near retirement. Ask questions such as:
What is the mix of investment-grade credit, high-yield and government bonds throughout the glide path?
How does the exposure to BBB bonds vary over time?
How much equity is being used alongside BBB and high-yield bonds?

The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Higher yielding, higher risk bonds can fluctuate in price more than investment-grade bonds, so investors should maintain a long-term perspective.
Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness.

Health care is complex and expensive, so employers place a premium on knowledge in this space.
Benefits consultants and retirement plan professionals make strong allies.
A combined “wealth care” package improves competitive advantage.
Peanut butter and jelly. Movies and popcorn. Health care and retirement plans. Some things just go together.
While financial professionals have long separated health care and retirement plans in their work, the two live together in employers’ minds as part of a total benefits package. Indeed, the association is so strong – and the combination so compelling – that financial professionals may want to embrace packaging the two.
To do this, consider forming an alliance with benefits consultants. Together, you can present a cohesive “wealth care” solution that strengthens your competitive advantage – and theirs.
Before we delve into details, let’s review the landscape.
Benefits are overwhelming
Employees are increasingly fatigued and overwhelmed by benefits complexities.
Of people with employer coverage, 67% find it difficult to understand their medical insurance, based on a Kaiser Family Foundation/Los Angeles Times survey done in 2018.
Only 29% of employees know about caregiving resources offered by their benefits plans, according to 2019 Bank of America research.
Only 12% of employees access voluntary benefits, like dental or vision, according to a 2018 survey from Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI).
Education is also lacking. Based on the same EBRI data, 37% of employees say they receive no education or advice on benefits.
Health care reigns supreme
Employers’ highest value investment, from a pure expenditure perspective, is the employee health care plan. Let’s compare:
A small retirement plan with 100 participants and $5 million in assets translates to an average of $61,500 annually, or $5,125 a month from the employer, in terms of total plan expenses.
For a health plan of the same size, the average cost is $490,800 annually, or $40,900 a month. A portion of that may be reimbursed by employee paycheck deferral.
Based on these examples, health care can cost eight times as much as a 401(k) plan. It makes sense, then, for employers to focus more of their time and HR budget on health care.
Team up to level up
Because benefits consultants offer extensive health care knowledge, they often have the ear of employers, but they are not competitors to financial professionals who work with retirement plans. Rather, they can be teammates and collaborators.
Both benefits consultants and plan professionals have value to offer one another in what could be a fruitful and symbiotic relationship.
As a retirement plan professional, you have existing relationships with large organizations that would prove valuable to the benefits counselor. 
Benefits counselors have fluency and nuanced knowledge in matters of health care and can include you in conversations that might otherwise happen without you.
What is wealth care?
By combining the wealth management experience of a retirement plan professional and the health care knowledge of a benefits consultant, you can create an employer-centric total benefits package. That’s wealth care.
As a bundle, wealth care can be greater than the sum of its parts.
It can make employers’ lives easier with joint meetings and materials.
A combined retirement/health benefits plan would be more difficult for competitors to subvert. In order to change solutions, the employer would need to unbundle the solution they have in place with you.
A joint value proposition speaks to more of employers’ top concerns at once.
Here are four things you can do to put together a wealth care package.
1. Align schedules
Save the employer time by scheduling meetings together to work in tandem on a total benefits package. When you coordinate your timelines with a benefits consultant and visit together, you’re able to increase impact by telling a joint story.
Think about employees signing on for a new job. They get to discuss the 401(k) at the same time they make their health plan elections, making their lives easier and the employer’s ability to retain top talent greater. This best practice should happen not only in the onboarding process but also annually or even quarterly.
2. Co-brand materials
A co-branded pack of resources for the employer and employee is a tangible takeaway you can offer. It can include combined resources, like:
Biometric screening forms
Mail service pharmacy information
Financial wellness resources
List of preventative services
Information on using telemedicine
The joint resource pack can make it easy for the employer to pass along valuable benefits information to workers, which in turn demonstrates their (and your) commitment to employee well-being.
3. Hone your pitch
You’re used to crafting a value proposition for clients and plan sponsors, but in pitching collaboration with a benefits consultant, you’re speaking to a whole new selling vector.
Your value proposition to a benefits consultant includes:
Education for the employer and employee
Industry connections and client network
Market intelligence via similar clients
Investment knowledge
Partner resources
You can also indicate if you have knowledge in health care matters that affect retirement, like health savings accounts (HSAs) and Medicare.
HSAS
HSAs can be powerful tax-advantaged investment vehicles, and their adoption rate is rising along with high-deductible health plan (HDHP) enrollment. In a joint discussion, the benefits consultant can refer the investment discussion to you. These may be dollars that you can keep on your side of the benefits/retirement equation.
MEDICARE
Medicare is a key retirement consideration for many people, but benefits consultants and employers lack incentive to talk about it. Here you can make a difference.
Key topics to cover regarding Medicare include:
Medicare Part A vs. Part B
Medigap
Medicare Advantage Plan (“Part C”)
Medicare Plan D
When HSA assets can be used and when they’re not permitted
4. Refine your knowledge
To make yourself indispensable in benefits conversations and improve your pitch, take time to brush up on the language of health care and resources that may help participants in unexpected ways.
Explore and bookmark sites like:
Social Security Administration
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
Life Expectancy Calculator based on the largest study of people who live to 100
Caregiver Action Network for employees taking care of elder relatives
National Association of Area Agencies on Aging
Eldercare Locator, sponsored by the U.S. Administration on Aging, to find local services 
National resources for parents of children with special needs
Regardless of your approach to aligning with benefits consultants, becoming more conversant in issues employers and participants care about will only help increase your value.
Stronger together
As the benefits environment expands, benefits consultants and aggregators will continue to gain significance. This shift in dynamics can be an incredible opportunity if you embrace these professionals as allies. Together, you have the tools and knowledge to help employers create a cohesive benefits package that cares for employees’ health and wealth. That’s the synergy of wealth care.

Educate employees on HSAs.
Review HSA investment options for appropriateness and range of objectives (similar to a DC plan investment structure).
Health care costs threaten retirement readiness
Rising medical expenses can impede retirement savings. Not only do high costs affect plan participants’ ability to make contributions during working years, they can also consume assets post-retirement. Consider these statistics:
290%: Increase in U.S. health care spending from $2,900 per person in 1980 to $11,200 per person in 2018 (figures in 2018 dollars), according to The Brookings Institution
$265K: Projected savings many 65-year-old couples will need to cover health expenses in retirement, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute
2x: The rate by which, on average, increases in health spending have outpaced increases in wages over the last decade, according to Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker
To help contain these costs, many companies have moved to consumer-driven health plans (CDHPs), which carry lower premiums but higher employee deductibles. Such plans are often paired with a tax-advantaged health savings account (HSA) to cover out-of-pocket expenses.
The role of health savings accounts
Although HSAs were originally introduced as a cost-saving measure, many employers are realizing that these accounts can work effectively with a defined contribution (DC) plan to promote better retirement outcomes.
HSAs offer several advantages:
Triple-tax free status: Employees enrolled in CDHPs can contribute to HSAs with pretax money. Principal and earnings are not taxable. Unlike DC plans, distributions are not taxed if used for qualified medical expenses. While there are annual contribution limits, there is no cap on how much can be invested and retained in the account.
“Stow it and grow it”: HSA assets can be withdrawn at any time without penalty (for qualified health care expenses), and unused balances can accumulate. Employers often contribute to an employee’s HSA. Money can be used on a wide range of health spending.
Long-term investing: HSA assets can be invested to help build savings for health care expenses. For short-term investments, a guideline is to set aside one year of maximum health care insurance deductibles. Amounts beyond that can be invested for growth for overall financial wellness and to cover medical expenses in retirement.
HSA assets are growing
As of August 2019, there were 26 million HSAs holding $61.7 billion in assets, a year-over-year increase of 12% for accounts and 20% for assets. Over one million of those accounts are investing a portion of their assets. 
Total HSA assets (in billions)
Employee education is key to success
For many retirement savers, the full range of HSA benefits may not be immediately obvious. That’s why education is so important. In order to achieve better outcomes with HSAs, participants need to first understand what’s possible.
When planning an HSA education program:
Clearly distinguish HSAs from other health savings vehicles, such as “use it or lose it” flexible spending accounts.
Highlight the costs of medical care in retirement and how HSAs can be used to address them.
Explain differences in tax treatment between HSAs and DC plans.
Outline ways to distribute contributions among HSAs, DC plans and other benefits. For example, employees might first put enough in their retirement plans to maximize their employer’s match, then put enough in an HSA to meet one year’s deductible and then invest part of the HSA.
Investing for future health care costs
As HSAs grow, plan sponsors are approaching investment options similarly to DC plan investments. Like retirement savers, HSA enrollees have varying risk tolerances and financial situations when investing for future health care costs. An HSA investment menu, then, can address a range of objectives and life stages much like a DC plan menu.
Ideas from DC menu planning that plan sponsors can apply to HSA menu arrangements:
Target date: The target date series used in DC plans may be an effective way of investing for long-term health care costs in a single investment solution. 
401(k) mirroring: Offering a core investment menu similar to the DC plan organizes the benefits package for employees and simplifies the due diligence process for employers.
A mix of investment options: Risk and financial situation are highly individualized, so the menu should contain a range of choices, including some that focus on stable investments.
An age-based framework to consider
As participants progress through career stages, their goals, financial situations and risk tolerance follow patterns well established in DC menu planning. Because those factors also influence HSA investment decisions, they can be used in HSA investment planning.
Hypothetical HSA account balance over investor lifetime
A holistic approach to wellness
To best prepare for a healthy retirement, participants will be well served by a holistic approach to saving. That includes understanding and accessing the full range of their benefits and investment solutions. With support and guidance from plan sponsors and financial professionals, savers can learn to view HSAs as not simply a health care benefit, but a critical pillar of retirement security.

376,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/ir-plan-leakage.html,Stem the flow of retirement plan leakage,Plan Design,"October 13, 2020","Employees who tap their retirement plans for loans or hardship withdrawals risk derailing their long-term savings goals. This plan “leakage” reduces aggregate 401(k)/IRA wealth by about 25% at retirement, according to Boston College Retirement Research. Now, some plan sponsors fear that leakage could worsen due to recent legislation and COVID-19-related economic hardships. Here are five action steps that plan sponsors can use to help address the issue.
1. Facilitate emergency savings accounts — A lack of emergency savings fuels leakage. A study from the Secure Retirement Institute found that 23% of households have no emergency savings at all, and only 25% can cover less than three months. They further found that regardless of net worth, those households with lower levels of emergency savings tended to have higher levels of leakage activity — loans, cash outs and hardship withdrawals — related to COVID-19. 
Low emergency savings drives leakage
Percentage increase in DC withdrawals under CARES Act by emergency saving level
The best way to reduce these withdrawals may be to make it easier for participants to save for emergencies. For example, employers could establish a payroll-deduction emergency savings program. 
In an AARP national survey, 71% of employees said they would likely participate in a payroll-deduction emergency savings “rainy day” savings program if their employer offered one.  
2. Give employees guidance — Since the onset of COVID-19, millions of Americans have been driven into unemployment. To provide financial relief, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), which increased the amount of loans participants could take from their 401(k)s. Only a fraction of non-retired households with retirement savings have accessed those savings by way of loans, hardship withdrawals, or withdrawals under the terms of the Act, according to the same Secure Retirement Institute survey. But if economic hardship continues, more participants may need to use their 401(k)s for emergency cash.
Plan sponsors can consider giving guidance so participants can make more informed choices based on their circumstances.
3. Allow continuation of loan repayment — Plan sponsors should consider allowing participants to continue to repay loan balances following separation of service. Most plans currently require that outstanding loans be paid back immediately and in full upon separation or they are considered distributions and then taxed and subject to early withdrawal penalties. Extending repayment may prevent leakage and help retain participant assets in plans.
4. Help take the mystery out of rollovers — Leakage is more often unintentional: resulting from a confluence of job changes, small balances and complicated rollover procedures leading to cashouts and even stranded assets. Other times it’s intentional: due to hardship withdrawals or loans for a house, education or life event. Plan sponsors may want to educate departing employees about the advantages of rolling over their assets into their new employer’s plan or into an IRA. Sponsors can also help mitigate leakage by providing necessary roll-in paperwork and guidance to new employees.
5. Support “auto portability” — We suggest that plan sponsors support industry and legislative efforts to provide automatic mechanisms to consolidate, streamline and port over disparate retirement assets for new employees. As we have seen with other DC auto features, the easier we make it for participants to help themselves, the better the outcomes.
While the extent of COVID-19’s impact on America’s retirement readiness is far from clear, it has already begun contributing to leakage, and plan sponsors should be rightly concerned. But there are proactive steps that can be taken to help participants financially affected by the pandemic keep more of their 401(k) assets working towards their future retirements.

378,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/dol-proposes-new-fiduciary-rule.html,What the proposed DOL rule could mean to 401(k) professionals,Fiduciary Responsibility,"September 15, 2020","If enacted, the rule could: 
Mark the first workable path to a fiduciary brokerage business model — enabling retirement plan professionals to receive investment-based compensation for their advice while ensuring they act in the best interests of their clients. 
Accelerate the growth of fee-based advisory business.
“Am I a fiduciary?”
It’s a question asked by many retirement plan sponsors. Another common inquiry: “What about my plan professional?” The easy answer to the former is “yes.” And now, a new DOL regulation seeks to help answer the second. Embedded in this controversial rule is a new definition of who would be considered a fiduciary, making it much harder for plan professionals to avoid fiduciary status.
A key point has been the difference between advice that would be considered fiduciary versus that which is merely suitable for a client’s needs or situation (non-fiduciary). Fiduciary status involves a much higher level of accountability and greater attention to potential conflicts of interest.
The new rule affects both retirement plan and IRA business, but its greatest impact is likely to be on plan professionals
In June of 2020, a new best interest rule went into effect. Brought forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Reg BI applies only to broker advice provided to individual investors regarding the sale of securities or retail accounts. It doesn’t extend to recommendations to retirement plan sponsors.
Tightly coordinated with the newly enacted Reg BI, the DOL proposal applies more broadly to registered investment advisers and brokers providing advice to retail clients as well as institutional retirement plan clients. At the same time, it provides a reasonable method for satisfying the requirements of fiduciary status while continuing to receive non-fee-based compensation (commissions, 12b-1 fees, sub-transfer agency fees).
The proposal would only apply to recommendations to retirement plans, participants and IRAs. The impact is however likely to be greatest for plan professionals because the new rule would be enforceable by plaintiffs in the retirement plan context. There is no private right of action to enforce the rule in the IRA context.
In essence, it forces a decision between the following two options:
Option 1
Act as a fiduciary and rely on the proposed new exemption to continue receiving brokerage compensation.
Option 2
Fully embrace a fiduciary fee-based business model and sidestep the requirements of the new exemption.
Key aspects of the DOL rule include:
A reinstatement of the DOL’s five-part test for determining fiduciary status that was a critical part of the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act (ERISA) Code enacted in 1974. However, this proposed rule also reinterprets the five-part test, expanding the definition of what would be considered fiduciary action. So now, for example, most retirement plan advice and many IRA rollover recommendations would be treated as fiduciary advice.
An exemption that would allow investment fiduciaries to receive compensation for nondiscretionary investment advice, as long as they acknowledge fiduciary status in writing and adhere to the impartial conduct standards under current securities law:
1.  Advice must be solely in the best interest of the client.
2.  The compensation paid must be reasonable.
3.  Statements made about the transaction cannot be misleading.
The proposed exemption would be available to registered investment advisers, broker-dealer firms, insurance companies, banks and individuals who are their employees or agents.
An annual review must be conducted to ensure compliance with the conditions of the new DOL rule, including exemption requirements. Specifically, the CEO of the broker-dealer firm would need to sign off on the review.

Treatment of conflicts of interest: Advice must be given without regard to conflicts of interest; disclosure is not sufficient
Scope of obligation: Transactional
Status: Enforced on September 1, 2020; other states either have or are considering proposing their own fiduciary standards
What happens next is uncertain
The DOL rule has just completed its initial comment period. Many firms and professionals are unhappy with the reinterpretation of the five-part test and are grappling with the implications of formally accepting the status of fiduciary. Such a position could increase exposure to class-action lawsuits, even when advice is rendered in the spirit of the client’s best interests.
Once finalized, the DOL rule would become effective in 60 days. The current administration is trying to fast-track the regulation into effect. The outcome of the presidential election will have substantial bearing on the fate of the proposed rule. It appears that a Biden administration would likely block it in favor of their own, possibly stricter, regulation.
As a result, it may be some time before the regulatory landscape solidifies. Firms and financial professionals would be well advised to continue monitoring developments.

Simplifying defined contribution (DC) menus may help improve participant decision-making.
Equities may be the most important part of the menu to simplify.
Using funds with broader mandates can reduce dependence on style boxes.
U.S. equity funds are the largest asset category in the defined contribution system, representing 35% of all retirement plan assets. When selecting equity options for their participants, plan sponsors face a dizzying set of choices:
Value, growth or blend investment style?
Domestic, global or multinational-focused?
Large caps or the potentially greater opportunity of small and mid caps?
Alternative asset classes, like real estate, sector and alternate beta strategies?
What about a brokerage window?
Faced with this complexity — and the different risk/return profiles of these different options — many plan sponsors have elected to provide participants with the full range of equity opportunities.
Historically, this has meant creating menus by style box, offering one or more investments in each of the Morningstar equity subcategories.
Why style boxes challenge participant choice
This seemingly sensible approach has pushed the average number of equity choices faced by participants to 11 and the average number of DC menu choices to 20, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America's 2018 survey of profit sharing and 401(k) plans.
Participants already confused about the stock market are forced to make long-term decisions based on multiple, similar growth options. As a result, they might “naively diversify” by allocating proportionally among the available options, or faced with choice overload, they might not take action at all.
So how does one adapt equity menus to the needs of participants?
Keep simplification simple.
Plan sponsors can offer fewer funds and still cover the full range of asset classes.
Finding the right balance, however, is tricky. Too many choices could make it difficult for plan sponsors to meet oversight and due diligence requirements, while too few may not offer enough risk mitigation or potential future income streams.
Three keys to structuring a U.S. equity lineup
Here are some progressive steps plan sponsors can take to build more rational menus that may diversify risk and improve participant choice.
1. Shift the focus from style boxes to asset class.
Traditional style-box components can be combined into one core fund for each capitalization. One broadly diversified large-cap option can capture a range of investment strategies, making it easy for participants to choose and diversify.
2. Reduce three (or more) asset classes into one growth fund.
Sponsors uncertain about such drastic reductions can still rationalize equity menus. Diversifying similar equity funds across regions, market capitalizations and/or sectors may help participants capture a larger proportion of the total investment opportunities.
3. Redirect fund metrics to participant needs.
With fewer funds to choose, sponsors should be more thoughtful about the specific funds they select. Do they meet participant needs for replacement income and risk mitigation? Such measures as upside vs. downside capture ratio, dividend yield and active share (potential for diverging from index benchmarks) may help identify the best fund options.
Streamlined equity choices may help participants make better investment decisions.
Often, defined contribution plans offer too many equity choices, yet fall short of providing sufficient opportunity to maximize returns and minimize risk. Fewer, more thoughtful equity choices may maximize participants’ opportunities while simplifying decision-making.

How are companies spending this windfall?
Hundreds of firms have announced plans to reinvest in their business, increase charitable contributions, give bonuses and/or salary increases to employees, and pass along their tax savings to customers.
Sometimes lost in these announcements is a longer-term commitment many companies have made to their employees’ retirement security: a significant number of American companies — in all sectors — have publicly announced plans to boost their 401(k) and other retirement plan contributions due to tax reform.
Most companies are considering changes to their benefit programs.
A recent Towers Watson survey found 26% of employers are considering or taking steps to increase their 401(k) contributions due to tax reform, and 19% are doing the same with pension plan contributions.
The numbers go even higher when including health, family leave and other benefit arrangements. The January 2018 survey of 333 large and mid-size employers also discovered that 66% are planning, considering, or have already made changes to their overall benefit programs as a result of tax reform.
The most common changes being considered include:
Addressing pay-gap issues (36%)
Expanding personal financial planning (34%)
Introducing a profit-sharing or one-time bonus payout to all employees (21%)
Great opportunity for advisors and sponsors to strengthen DC plans
For decades, government regulation of the U.S. retirement plan system has sought to improve retirement security. Although tax reform has many implications for investors, it doesn’t make significant changes to the retirement system.* It has, however, already boosted efforts to improve the retirement savings picture.
Advisors, consultants and plan sponsors can stay ahead of this curve by making use of this opportunity to look at plan menu and design issues now with an eye toward improving the participant experience.
Here are some potential action steps:
Simplify menus to improve participant engagement.
Assess the target date fund to make sure it meets participant needs.

382,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/retiring-abroad-financial-implications.html,Thinking of retiring abroad? Consider these 5 key financial implications,Retirement Planning,"September 26, 2017","Move over, Florida. Mountaintop hideaways, tropical islands, seaside fishing villages and country villas are luring more Americans beyond the comfortable borders of the United States.
The falling cost of international travel, the widespread adoption of technology, and the strength of the U.S. dollar have made it possible for more Americans to retire abroad, says Olivia Mitchell, who heads the Boettner Center for Pensions and Retirement Research at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
In fact, the Social Security Administration sent out payments to 380,000 retirees living in other countries in 2014, according to the Miami Herald. That’s a 50% increase over the previous decade.
“If you are the adventurous type, retiring abroad can have a lot to offer,” Mitchell says. “But if you don’t plan well, it can be disastrous.”
Retiring abroad isn’t necessarily all walks on the beach. It means adopting a whole new set of financial rules. Making the move abroad shouldn’t be done without thorough planning on the part of retirees and their financial advisors. Here are some things retirees should keep in mind before selling their belongings and buying a one-way ticket to paradise.
The tax man followeth
First things first: It’s essential that retirees understand leaving the United States does not exempt Americans from their U.S. tax obligations. Serious pitfalls can occur if you don’t understand and plan for the tax implications at play, Mitchell says. Those implications can be ruinous, “derailing your retirement plans,” she says.
That means retired expats must still file annually with the IRS, even if they move all of their assets to a foreign country. And depending on where they land, they may still have to fulfill the tax obligations of their foreign country of residence.
Is your Social Security secure?
Advances in technology have made it much easier for expats to conduct routine financial transactions. Retirees can arrange to have their Social Security benefits deposited directly into their bank accounts. And most of the time, U.S. citizens find that their Social Security benefits will follow them wherever they live.
There are some exceptions, however. The Social Security Administration won’t send payments to beneficiaries in Cuba and North Korea. It also won’t send payments to people in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova or Ukraine, among other countries. Knowing whether you can count on this income source has enormous ramifications for savers planning for retirement.
Don’t bank on it
Winnie Sun, a founding partner of Sun Group Wealth Partners in Irvine, California, has clients in countries from Austria to Japan. The first thing she advises them to do is have a strong U.S. footprint. That means keeping the bulk of assets at home and keeping their savings in U.S. or international banks.
“The U.S. financial and banking system is generally the safest and most reliable in the world. And reliability matters when moving abroad,” she says.
But don’t stop there. Investigating everything from whether your will is legally enforceable to local traffic laws and licensing requirements can save you and your family a world of hurt and frustration, Sun says.
Planning and having open and constant communication between the retiree and financial advisor “can mean the difference between a calm retirement and a calamity,” she says.
Home sweet home
There’s a big difference between a vacation and permanent residency when it comes to understanding and living in a new culture. Although many countries eagerly welcome expats, you’ll need to comply with residency requirements. Some countries require you to earn a specific amount of income every month to qualify for residency.
For example, Mexico’s low costs and proximity to the U.S. make it a popular destination for retirees. However, the Mexican constitution bars foreigners from directly owning property within 62 miles of any border and within 31 miles of the coast. Property purchases in these areas must be done through a trust that gives a bank title to the property. Even Western countries like France have rules about how foreigners can purchase homes, Mitchell says. Homelessness isn’t a surprise any retiree wants to receive.
You can’t count on medicare
Americans are living longer than ever. For many pre-retirees and their financial advisors, figuring out how much they’ll need to save for health care costs can be the toughest part of retirement planning. For retirees venturing abroad, there is an added wrinkle: Medicare, the U.S. government health plan for people aged 65 and over, does not cover health care overseas.
“We highly recommend that you get health insurance to cover private medical and dental treatment and for medical evacuation to the United States, just in case,” the State Department’s guide to retiring abroad says.
Many countries have national health systems, but be sure to investigate eligibility and quality beforehand, Sun says. This is especially true if the retiree requires special medications or treatments. What’s more, local environmental conditions, like dust or mold, may contribute to some health conditions.
The bottom line
Retiring abroad is possible, but it requires significant planning and preparation. And getting professional help will go a long way toward avoiding headaches. Even then, Sun and Mitchell both suggest spending six months to a year on an extended vacation before pulling the trigger and officially relocating.
“It can be the most exciting part of a retiree’s life, and it can be the most challenging,” Sun says. “The more time and energy you spend preparing before you leave the country, the better.”

383,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/millennials-gig-economy.html,How millennials can plan for retirement in the age of the gig economy,Millennials,"September 5, 2017","Thirty-five years of loyal service, a gold watch and a champagne send-off, followed by a steady pension. That was once the path to the American dream. Nowadays, it’s more like a fantasy. In its place is the so-called gig economy – the technology-enabled trend of individuals using their cars, homes, skills and spare time to earn income as freelancers.
Millennials, many of whom entered the labor force just as the financial crisis was upending the job market, are at the forefront of this growing trend. The “Wisdom of Experience” survey, commissioned by Capital Group, reveals that 21% of millennials work primarily in the gig economy, while an additional 14% earn extra income through a website or app. And the trend doesn’t show signs of slowing: A separate Intuit 2020 Report estimates that more than 40% of the U.S. workforce will be freelancers by the year 2020.
Without an employer-sponsored retirement plan, freelancers must handle their own savings — and that can pose problems. Some reports indicate that as many as 70% of freelancers have no long-term savings at all. But the Wisdom of Experience survey found that millennials really care about saving for retirement: One in five ranked retirement saving as their top financial priority; the rest put it second, just below rent or mortgage payments.
So how can millennials in the gig economy take control of their retirement? We spoke to four financial advisors to get their tips:
Fill multiple buckets to weather droughts
Divam N. Mehta, founder of Mehta Financial Group:
“Income can be unsteady and unpredictable for millennials working in the gig economy. It is vital to start saving early in a tax-advantaged vehicle. Savings automation may not be the best idea for workers in the gig economy because of unsteady cash flow. Instead, it is critical that individuals remain disciplined and make timely contributions to a tax-advantaged vehicle as they get paid.
“Since financial flexibility is going to be critical for freelance millennials, it may be beneficial to have multiple accounts (tax-advantaged and taxable). Tax-advantaged retirement accounts will have liquidity restrictions, whereas taxable accounts will not. To retain maximum flexibility and liquidity, it may be suitable for millennials to contribute to both type of accounts as cash flow allows.”
Saving receipts saves money
Tony Chan, founder of Crossroads Planning:
“The first thing I advise is to get ahold of your recordkeeping. Good recordkeeping is priceless for a freelancer or a business owner. Not just recording your expenses, but your travel, your meeting with clients and anything that would traditionally be covered by employers. There are many upfront expenses and many expenses that are tax-deductible.”
“You need to have your books in great shape in order to know how much estimated tax you need to pay. And then I suggest millennials automate their savings, putting away 20% in savings to take care of taxes and retirement.”
Take (tax) advantage of lower earnings
Sophia Bera, founder of Gen Y Planning:
“I love Roth IRAs, and think that they could be a great fit for millennials because they’re usually in their lower income-earning years, which means that they are in a low tax bracket. Since you pay taxes on the money before you put it into the Roth IRA, you get to take it out tax-free in retirement.
“It is also possible to set a retirement account for your own business, with a SEP IRA or a Solo 401(k). As your business starts to take off, you’ll likely have a much bigger tax bill than in the past. The money you put into these types of accounts is tax-deductible, which can help reduce what you owe in taxes each year. The max on these is $54,000 for 2017, so you are able to sock away a ton more money for retirement.”
Hire your own HR manager
Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth LLC, co-author of The Millennial Money Fix:
“It’s essential to bring in a professional. In the gig economy, you have a lot more freedom, but you are your own HR department. And that means taking care of everything from retirement to disability insurance. It gets very complex, and can be very time-consuming.
“Bringing a professional in may seem expensive, but you have to remember that your time is worth something. Typically your time would be better spent working on your hustle and becoming a better businessperson than spending hours trying to structure your financial safety net all alone. And without professional help, it could end up more expensive in the long run. Financial professionals give you back your time and give you peace of mind.”

384,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/3-reasons-cash-balance-plan.html,3 reasons employers should consider a cash balance plan,Defined Benefit,"May 30, 2017","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
A cash balance plan allows employees to contribute more toward retirement than with only a 401(k) plan.
A cash balance plan may best fit organizations with predictable cash flow and consistent profits.
A cash balance plan increases tax savings for employers.
Defined contribution plans continue to eclipse defined benefit plans by an ever-widening margin in terms of the number of plans and assets. However, there’s at least one growth area in the defined benefit world: the cash balance plan.
A cash balance plan is a defined benefit plan in which an employer credits a participant’s account with a “pay credit” (a percentage of pay or a flat dollar amount) and an “interest credit” (either a fixed or a variable rate).
In fact, this plan type can offer the best of both defined contribution and defined benefit worlds, which may be especially attractive for business owners and their key employees who are playing catch-up with their retirement savings.
More specifically, a cash balance plan may best fit organizations with a predictable cash flow and consistent profits. These could include, but aren’t limited to:
Professional groups, including lawyers, doctors, dentists, engineers, architects and accountants
Family and closely held businesses
Sole proprietors
Organizations that already contribute the maximum to their current defined contribution plans
Here are three reasons employers should consider adding a cash balance plan:
1. Employers and Key Employees Can Accumulate More for Retirement and Reduce Current Taxes
The main attraction of a cash balance plan is that employers and their key employees can typically contribute more — often much more — to the plan.
For example, as the accompanying table illustrates, a 60-year-old owner or key employee could contribute up to $24,000 to a 401(k) plan or up to $60,000 if the 401(k) plan is coupled with a profit-sharing plan. Adding the cash balance plan to the 401(k) and profit sharing plans, however, would permit total employee and employer contributions of up to $305,000.
Moreover, employer contributions are deductible for the business. This means that an employer could have saved more than $126,000 in taxes on that same 60-year-old.
And while a cash balance plan may have higher administrative costs than a 401(k) plan, largely because its funding must be certified by an actuary each year, the tax benefits of investing six-figure annual contributions into cash balance plans can offset this additional administrative cost.
2. It’s Easier for Employees to Understand Than a Traditional Defined Benefit Plan
Determining the payout of a traditional defined benefit plan typically involves actuarial tables and complex calculations. Worse, interim projections are hypothetical. The actual payout for a traditional defined benefit plan is not certain until all service and earnings variables are known at the actual retirement date.
Contrast this with a cash balance plan, which in most cases guarantees a specific rate of interest on contributions. For this reason, projecting an account balance at a specific date in the future is far simpler and more reliable, and unlike other defined benefit plans, the actual investment returns do not affect the benefit amounts promised to participants.
The bottom line? Because participants have a better understanding of their cash balance plan account, they will appreciate the plan more.
3. It’s More Portable Than a Defined Benefit Plan
Upon separation from service, cash balance account values can, as a lump sum, be distributed or rolled over to an IRA or another employer-sponsored plan.
This makes cash balance plans more portable, and therefore more appealing to participants.
Deciding Whether a Cash Balance Plan Is Right for a Particular Business
A cash balance plan, however, may not be right for all companies. Since a cash balance plan must be funded on an annual or more frequent basis, employers should be confident the firm’s cash flow and profitability will permit it to meet its funding requirements.
The responsibility for investing plan assets for participants rests with the employer. If investment returns do not keep up with funding requirements, additional, and often unanticipated, contributions will have to be made. Generally, a local third-party administrator can help with the plan design.
Also, business owners should expect to make cash balance contributions amounting to roughly 5% to 8% of employees’ pay, compared with the 3% contribution that’s more typical in a 401(k) plan.

385,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/how-debt-affects-retirement.html,How does household debt affect retirement?,Retirement Planning,"May 11, 2017","KEY TAKEAWAYS 
People are carrying more debt into retirement than ever before.
The younger you are, the more likely debt will be a problem.
Reduce borrowing and increase investing while you’re still working.
While there is extensive media coverage regarding Americans’ lack of retirement savings, a much less discussed topic is the growing amount of debt that Americans carry into retirement. Larger mortgages, higher student loans and a greater overall comfort with debt than displayed by earlier generations has increased the average debt for households approaching retirement by nearly 160% from 1989 to 2010, according to AARP.
Making payments on this increasing amount of debt can force people to retire later than they’d like or borrow more after they stop working, when household income generally falls.
U.S. consumer debt timeline
Credit innovations since World War II have helped fund the rise in the U.S. standard of living by providing financing for home mortgages, credit card spending and education costs.
When you retire might depend on when you were born
The rise in debt affects age groups differently. For current retirees, who are generally of the so-called silent generation born before the mid-1940s, debt is much less of a problem. They have borrowed less and owe less than their generational counterparts.
Those approaching retirement, the baby boomers, are far more indebted and as a result are, on average, 15% less confident about their financial security and preparedness than the silent generation, according to a recent Pew Charitable Trusts report.
But boomers can instruct on the importance of retirement saving. The younger generations are borrowing even more.
Generation X’ers are the most heavily indebted generation in U.S. history, although millennials top the list in terms of student loan debt, as education costs continue to increase much faster than household income.
With different generational experiences of debt, it’s no surprise the generations have different levels of confidence in their retirement security. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute’s (EBRI) 2015 Retirement Confidence Survey, current retirees actually retired earlier than current workers expect to retire. Only 14% of current retirees actually retired at age 66 or older, while almost half of current workers 55 or older expect to retire at 66 or older. Moreover, 11% of current workers 55 or younger never expect to retire, according to the survey.
What is the impact of higher student loan debt on retirement savings?
The rapid increase in student loan debt has led some to wonder if younger generations will face more hurdles to retirement preparedness than their parents did. If today’s working households had started out with the student loan balances facing recent college graduates, the number of households at risk of not being able to maintain their pre-retirement standard of living would increase from 45.3% to 51.6% (for the group aged 50-59). That’s the conclusion of “Will the Explosion of Student Debt Widen the Retirement Security Gap,” by Munnell, Hou and Webb, a paper published in 2016.
In a more positive light, a recent Center for Retirement Research (CRR) paper, “How Does Student Debt Affect Early-Career Retirement Saving,” concludes the relationship between student debt and participation in a retirement plan is small and not statistically significant. “Though young workers’ balance sheets are clearly hurt by student debt,” authors Rutledge, Sanzenbacher and Vitagliano argue, “they do not substantially reduce retirement saving to compensate.”
How to bring debt into balance
For better or worse, debt has become a key method by which American households increase their lifetime earning power. Easier access to credit and greater debt availability have helped many Americans afford major purchases such as homes, which have strengthened the asset side of their balance sheets, as well as college degrees, which have become increasingly necessary in the competitive labor market.
The loans and credit cards that expanded opportunities during the working years can constrict flexibility in retirement. A proper financial plan should include paying down as much debt as possible while you are still working.
5 ways to reduce the impact of debt in retirement
Budget during your working years, so that as many major and emergency expenses can be managed through savings as possible.
Stick to the budget, so dollar limits are enforced on entertainment, food, clothes and holiday items you want but may not need.
Optimize the amount saved for retirement through consistent contributions to IRA and/or 401(k) accounts.
Contribute to 529 plans to help plan for college expenses and potentially unburden the next generation from large amounts of student loan debt.
Educate yourself on the costs of debt, which far outweigh the costs of the item financed (even with today’s low interest rates).

386,retirement,https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/jam-retirement-choice.html,From jam to retirement: Why more choice can be debilitating,Participant Engagement,"December 21, 2016","Retirement choice: It all started with jam.
One day, shoppers at an upscale food market saw a display table with two dozen varieties of gourmet jam. On another day, shoppers saw a similar table — except only six varieties were on display. Behind the scenes, Ivy League researchers watched.
It came as no surprise to see more customers flock to the larger display, gravitating to the intriguing smorgasbord of options and flavors. What shocked the researchers, and the academic world since, was that when the time came for people to actually buy, those who saw the smaller display were 10 times more likely to purchase jam than those who saw the larger one.
The outcome of the experiment, conducted in 2000 by Columbia University professor Sheena Iyengar and Stanford University’s Mark Lepper, flew in the face of prevailing conventional wisdom that more options lead to more engagement. The results were as clear as they were surprising: more choice isn’t always better.
Curious to see if the seemingly irrational behavior applied to heftier decision-making, Iyengar and her colleagues turned their eyes to retirement. They reviewed 650 company 401(k) plans and the behavior of nearly 800,000 employees. Each company studied was providing its employees with at least a 50-cent match for every dollar invested in its retirement savings program. Again, Iyengar found the same results: the more options a retirement plan offered, the fewer employees participated in those plans — even if it meant foregoing employer contributions.
People are “burdened by the responsibility of distinguishing good from bad decisions,” she and Lepper wrote about their jam study findings. “Having unlimited options, then, can lead people to be more dissatisfied with the choices they make.”
Too much choice leads to dissatisfaction.
Classical economic theory assumes people are rational consumers, making logical choices. Psychologists have held up the idea of choice over the years as a good thing that gives customers a sense of personal control. But behavioral economics has exposed a kink in those arguments.
With so many options to choose from, people find it difficult to choose at all. And when they do choose, they feel overwhelmed and less satisfied with their selection. Social scientists and economists have dubbed this the “paradox of choice.”
At a time when the proliferation of choice has given consumers more financial options — from choosing a 401(k) to selecting a long-term insurance policy — these findings have huge implications for investors and financial service professionals.
“If too much choice is reducing the number of people who take part in the retirement plan, or some other financial service that they can benefit from, then everyone has a problem,” said John Doyle, a senior vice president of defined contribution at Capital Group. “You can’t reap any benefit if the amount of choice you have is keeping you from participating at all.”
How to put it into practice
The main challenge is convincing consumers that having fewer options can in fact be better for them. But it is possible.
Companies such as Apple and Google actually credit much of their success to this concept. They say getting rid of clutter and focusing on simpler interfaces, fewer options and features helps customers get what they really want. For the financial services industry, that means carefully designing options and fewer, easier-to-understand menu choices to encourage better decision-making.
For example, it may make sense to relabel investing options by dividing a retirement plan menu into investment objectives that reflect the participants’ years to retirement, or investment options organized around life stages. When organized this way, concerns about risk preference and volatility can be viewed in a palatable way.
But key to this approach is first knowing what options are right for a client, said Doyle.
“If you are going to convince them that it’s OK to limit choice, you have to be able to demonstrate that you can deliver,” he said.
The bottom line: if financial professionals can find the right balance between choice and simplicity, then they may find the recipe for success. It worked for jam.
